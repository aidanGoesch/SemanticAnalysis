We were married and in a wonderful relationship for 15 years when out of the blue, he left me for a younger woman. I was devastated.I contributed it to a specific event that lead to his PTSD being triggered and he ran away. My heart was broken and I felt resigned to the idea that it would stay that way.  I didn't even have any pets.  I had been to a local fiber festival where I met a greyhound dog. I talked to the owners for awhile and by the time I got home I knew what to do. I pent a couple of months thinking about how a greyhound would effect my life, could I afford her, my responsibilities.    I knew this would work if I got the right dog. I put in my application to a somewhat local greyhound rescue. They contacted me back and and agreed I would be a suitable adopter of a retired racing greyhound.  I let them know that since I was driving over an hour that  I would like to have a few dogs to choose from so that I would hopefully not have to repeat the drive.  When I got there I was under the impression I would be looking at several dogs but it turned out there was only two. One of them was very sickly looking and had just had surgery to her mouth. Overall she did not appeal to me. The other was older than I was expecting but I agreed to look at her. I walked her around the yard, sat with her, pet her and knew I could give her a good home. She seemed scared and lonely, much like me. It did not take much time and we bonded.  She would not leave my side. She walked with me, lay by my feet when I sat, sleep where she could always see me. It has been several months now and we are closer than ever. She fills a huge void in my home and my heart. We keep each other company and smile a great deal, something I did not think I would do for a long time. I am very lucky to have my companion.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J7UW3ZQ,
