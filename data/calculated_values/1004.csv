Overall, things have been going smoothly, but I am still prone to worry that something might be amiss with the baby. This is particularly due to the fact that it is difficult to know what is going on inside, especially in the early months. As my pregnancy progressed, I was eagerly waiting for the moment when I would begin to feel the baby move. This didn't happen as early as something of the books indicated it might, which lead to worry. Eventually, though, I began to feel fluttering movements that seemed different from other sensations I had experienced. I became fairly confident these movements were the baby, but it was still easy to doubt myself. Two weeks of this mix of confidence and doubt was relieved one night, though.  I felt some kicks (at least what I hoped were kicks), and I encourage my husband to feel my belly. It was doubtful if he could feel anything yet, as the doctor indicated it might be awhile before anyone else could sense movement, but he felt something. In that moment, his face lit up with excitement, especially as the baby kept kicking, affirming what he was feeling. He held up a finger every time he felt something, and I confirmed that I felt movement simultaneously. It was an incredibly joyful moment for us. It left us feeling close and connected, both with each other, and with the baby. Additionally, it made me feel safe and secure knowing that the movement I had been feeling wasn't entirely in my own head. This was a beautiful moment in our relationship and in my pregnancy.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J8OFZ3U,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J8OFZ3U
