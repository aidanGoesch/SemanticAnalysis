As the day wore on and it got closer to the time to go to the service I knew I couldn't leave her. She was laying on her dog bed and breathing heavily. Just before it was time to go I told my fiance to go without me. There was no way that I was leaving my dog alone. I laid her head on my lap. I played her songs that we had listened to together over the years. She was mostly quiet as I stroked her head. I told her stories about our life together. I told her what a great dog and friend she had been. I told her that it was okay to go. It would hurt me worse than I could imagine but I had to let her go. It was only about a half hour after my fiance left. I knew something was different. My dogs breathing changed and she seemed agitated. She let out a few rattling breathes and then she was gone. I felt like my heart was literally ripped out.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0JAF83ZB,
