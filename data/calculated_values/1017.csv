I'm so confused. Today I was walking around seeing some historical sites on my trip to China, and saw police stopping bicyclists. It all seemed random, like chaos with no rhyme or reason to it. I mean I've heard about things like this, but to actually see it in person is a whole different story. I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but the things that happened today really makes me wonder about it now. So when I got back to my room at the hotel I wrote to my friend about it all. I just wanted to hear their opinion on the matter. Then the strangest thing happened. My laptop froze up. Yeah, I know most people would write it off as a minor technical issue and reboot it, but it's literally a brand new laptop I bought just before the trip. Like I said, I'm not a conspiracy theorist but this happening to a brand new laptop right after I wrote an email to a buddy and tried to send it out of the country. I really wonder now if people really are that suppressed here. I never took the great firewall seriously. But it is defiantly real now I think. I can't even tell if the E-mail was sent or not, because after rebooting I couldn't reconnect to any internet.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0JJAW3ZY
