I knew my friend and I were really good friends, but I had no idea he valued my friendship this much. Part of me wonders if I was selected because of my photographing skills, but I'd like to imagine it was because of our close friendship as well. The day was one of the greatest days of my life. The small venue and exclusiveness of the wedding made it feel a lot different. Much more different than any other wedding I've been to. Due to the fact my friend and their significant other did not need to spend a lot of money on extra guests, we had a very personalized experience. The food was absolutely top notch, much better than anything I've ever tasted. I got to capture photos that were much more intimate than any wedding. I got to solely focus on the immediate family and the couple, as there were not a log of guests to bog down my time. Not only did I get to take the serious and core photos of the family and couple, but I also got to take a bunch of silly ones. Though this occurred 4 months ago, I can still remember everything in perfect details. In fact, I have the pictures to prove it! The scenery chosen was beautiful, fountains and amazing flowers encompasses the backgrounds. I think my favorite part was the genuinely happy faces that everyone held the entire time. I'm not sure I've ever seen a wedding where everyone was so happy. In summary, I will always remember this wedding, not only because of the exclusiveness but how wonderful I enjoyed it on a personal and professional level. I'm not sure I'll ever experience something like this again.",,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXC7MZOEN
