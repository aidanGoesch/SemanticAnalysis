People who are abusive like to build themselves up by putting others down. They often want you to feel bad about yourself, and try to do things to bring you down. your own ‘inner voice’ – if you focus on negative things, or tell yourself that you are hopeless or that you are to blame for everything that goes wrong, then this can also lower your confidence and self-esteem. In turn, this can affect how you relate to others. You might find yourself trying too hard to please others. You might think your needs don’t matter, so you don’t stand up for yourself. You can change your ‘inner voice’ and think more positively about yourself. How are you thinking? Don’t be hard on yourself or focus on mistakes. Don’t blame yourself for the way other people act­. If someone has put you down, bullied you or hurt you, it says more about them than it does about you. Focus on positive things like your achievements and good qualities. Try Dear Diary: feeling better about myself. If a little voice inside your head says “But I was so stupid/weak/dumb to put up with that” (or something like that), fight back! Remind yourself: there’s nothing wrong with hoping someone will change, or giving someone a second (or seventh!) chance. When someone has treated you badly it can be hard to know what to say or do – there’s nothing wrong with feeling confused. What’s wrong is the abuse. Tell yourself that you don’t deserve to be treated this way. Believe it’s not your fault. The other person has done the wrong thing – not you! Be proud of the way you’ve been able to be strong and of the ways you have found to keep going while dealing with the stress and trauma of the abuse. Ways to feel betterGet involved in something that interests you and that helps you connect with other people, like a sport or a hobby. Do exercise or take up a sport – this can help you to feel fitter, stronger and less stressed.",30LSNF239VHXLDFZMQS9QJS18MII2Q,30LSNF239VHXLDFZMQS9QJS18MII2Q
