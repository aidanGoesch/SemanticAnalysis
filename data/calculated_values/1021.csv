This was my first wedding I've done solo and was pretty nerve wracking to remember everything I had to do. On top of everything they wanted to do it outdoors which is fine usually but with where we live and what time of year it was which was March proved to be a little challenging. But it was a task I was up for doing for a couple of friends. The day started out with to be one of the coldest of the year at a brisk 10 degrees Fahrenheit out highs of about 15 that day would prove to be great weather under shaded trees behind their grandparents house. The first thing was photographing the bride which was great and inside where it was nice and warm. The groom I had to photography outside first while he kept his hands warm to take pictures without his gloves on as that would look silly. The wedding short while and the bride walked down through a candle lined path in the woods to finally get married after 10 years at a surprise wedding none of our friends knew about just their family. It was a great ceremony quick because of the cold followed by quick photos outside where they got married. We finished the day having the reception at a popular resort drinking the night away. The dinner was Filet minion and salmon with wonderful vegetables that were out of this world great. The cake that night was amazing too and surprisingly they did not smash it into each others faces. We spent 5 hours talking that night and drinking by the fire there until the venue told us we had to move on for the night. It was amazing to photography their special day and be invited to do it as one of the only friends to know they were getting married. It meant a lot that they would not only choose me to do it but also that they would let me know about the surprise wedding and partake in the day.,,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXC7MZOEN
