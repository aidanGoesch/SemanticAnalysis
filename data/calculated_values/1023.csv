My daughter and I went on a trip.  Initially, the trip was her idea. She wanted to dress up and be vintage and ride on the starlight train.  She had a romantic idea about the train and she offered to pay for it.  We ended up getting a roomette which was a tiny private room on the train.  It forced us to be in close proximity to each other and there was no wifi on the train for her  to tune me out.  It was kind of fun.  However, the train included meals and the meals were amazing but on a train everything is small so they seat you at a table with strangers.  Part of the charm is to socialize with strangers.  We met all kinds of people and heard their stories and it made a huge impression on us.  There was a person who was so nice but had lost his job and family and had to take a hard and horrible job and his parents were helping to support him.  There was a very old person, maybe in his 80s who was a retired pallet salesperson and he was going to go visit his older brother.  After each meal, the experiences of the table mate would linger with my daughter and me and we would discuss the implications of our lives and ultimately how important family is.  She is my family and it brought us closer.",35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCE6POEO,
