I don't really like trans people so I wasn't happy to hear this result. When we first had the wedding, I thought they would be such a great couple. After a few months, I thought they were going to have children and start a life like that. When someone cheats they are violating a sacred bond between man and women. When someone goes trans, they are doing something perverse and subversive. The trans community is immersed in sinful behavior. They sexualize kids and do obscene behavior and pursue vices at their night clubs. I do not approve of this behavior by my cousin. And all the while, I thought he was a god fearing republican. Next time I see him I don't think I could look him in the eye. I feel really bad for my cousin. Now she will have to break up with him. She will be devastated. It's good that they didn't have children yet.",,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCEFJOE0
