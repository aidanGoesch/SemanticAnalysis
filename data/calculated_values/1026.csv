We BBQ a few times together each summer as they are local and we used to actually work together as well. She did the unthinkable and looked at his phone apparently. She thought he was maybe messing around with another woman. When she checked his phone, he left his browser open to a hookup site. She saw him wearing a dress and identifing as trans and is wanting to hook up while shes out of town. So she immediately texted me about it. I wish she hadn't even confided this to me. I don't know what to think. I defriended him on Facebook because hes a very vocal Trump supporter and we have argued about gay marriage. Hes very against what he considers anything other than traditional marriage to the point I just couldn't talk to him anymore. He's also a huge racist. As I'm sitting here, my phone has an unread message on it from her and I don't even want to read it. On one hand, I'm very angry about this dual nature of his and I hope she dumps his ass, on the other, if he didn't have an extreme view that hes presenting to the world, Id tell her maybe she just needs to have a long conversation with him about this and figure it out. I kinda just want to ghost both of them to be completely honest.",,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCEFJOE0
