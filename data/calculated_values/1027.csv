I was so incredibly nervous leading up to this surgery. In fact, beforehand, I had a major anxiety attack. This all occurred roughly two weeks ago. I have never been so nervous in my entire life. Nothing in life mattered in that moment than my mother getting out of that surgery OK. She had a crucial blood clot in her lungs and it was even life threatening. I was so incredibly terrified that i would lose my loving mother. I have never reacted with such a major panic attack before. It was like I could not even breathe I was so terrified. Thank God though, my mother is now well on the road to recovery. After surgery I thanked her doctor profusely. I would not wish this situation even on my worst enemy in the world. It was such an awful few hours waiting for her to get out of surgery. I am just so happy that my mother is OK. I pray every day for her health.",,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCHZOEO2
