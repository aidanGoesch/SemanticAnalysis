I went over to his place so we could talk it over. we grabbed some dinner and talked about it. we talked about where we might live. We also discussed how it would be financially and how we would work that out. I feel as if we covered a lot of ground. I feel like this is a good idea. I think that this can actually work and it has got me excited! i cannot wait to get things in motion. Sometimes in life you just have to jump in feet first! Next weekend we plan on getting the ball rolling. we are going to look for a place in the south west. i really think this is the right move. for me and for him. He is just as excited as I am.,,30LSNF239VHXLDFZMQS9QJS1HGU2IJ
