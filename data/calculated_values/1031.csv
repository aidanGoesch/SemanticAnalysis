I had been excited about this event all year and when the day came to head to the airport I was beyond ecstatic! I was going to get to see my Mom, both my younger sisters, and several other friends and family members I hadn't seen for years. I arrived in Nashville TN 6 days before the wedding so I could spend some quality time with my family and help out with the wedding. My Aunt was flying in from Utah whom I had not seen in 10 years and I was so excited to see her! I also had fun spending time with my sisters and my mom all week before the wedding. The day of the wedding came and boy could you feel the nerves in the air! I was a bridesmaid and also in charge of bringing my sisters dress and other supplies to the venue in the morning to get ready. I must say, I didn't know how stressful a wedding could be! There was so much to so and my sister had really bad nervousness. Anyways, all the bridesmaids got ready and helped my sister get ready and things were coming along nicely and it was now 2 hours before the wedding. Suddenly, my Mom came in the room saying there was a problem. It turns out the officiator was missing and no one could find him! A friends of the grooms was supposed to be officiating but no one could get a hold of him. Apparently he was known for being unreliable. My sister started panicking! My mom had an idea though. An old friend of the family was there and he could officiate weddings as well. I ran out to talk to him and he agreed to do it! Whew! Thank god! The wedding can go on! My sister looked absolutely stunning walking down the aisle and I felt so proud of her. The whole wedding was beautiful and there was not a dry eye in the house! I am so glad I was able to be part of my sisters special day and I miss everyone already.",,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCQSKEOT
