All of my furniture has been moved into the front room next to the door, so that I can get it out and onto the truck more easily tomorrow. My cat is wandering the halls of our huge apartment, confused as to why everything feels so empty. I've laid my mattress on the floor by the front door so that I can sleep there, and leave the empty rooms clean an undisturbed. Tomorrow morning, my sister and her husband, along with a few family friends, will be here with their pickups, so we can load all of my furniture and belongings. The drive to my new house is going to take about an hour, and we're going to attempt to pack everything in one trip. I've arranged the furniture in the order I think it needs to be loaded, so that most of the bedroom stuff will go in one truck. The living room stuff will ride in my friend's truck, and all of my boxes and bags of clothes and small household things will ride in the SUV with my cat. I'm planning a party at my new place, both as a thank you to the people who helped me move, and as a ""welcome home"" party for myself. The place I live now is way out in the country, which is nice and secluded, but far away from my friends and family in the city. Tomorrow, I will move back to the middle of the city and will be much closer to visit with my friends. It has been hard turning down offers to hang out for the evening or go out for drinks. I don't own a car, so making a 50 mile round trip to visit my friends for a few hours is quite a lofty proposition. Now that I live closer, not only can they come see me, I can get to them easier. For one thing, the city has better public transportation and walking paths/trails, I can cover any ground I want to on foot or take a bus if I can't drive where I'm going. I'm so glad to be back.",35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN588XK56Z,
