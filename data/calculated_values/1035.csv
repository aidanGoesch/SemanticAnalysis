It was the most perfect day, my wedding day. I couldn't have enjoyed it more. It started with a perfect sunshine among billowing clouds, without any threat of rain. All of my close family was there. I had an amazing hair dresser that made me feel like a princess. She made me look like a princess too! I did have a nervous moment walking down the isle with all those eyes looking at me. However, my dad was there to hold me up. I watched my future husband wipe a tear from his eye as I walked down the isle. I saw many smiles and nods of admiration as I passed each pew. We made our promises to each other. And my husband kissed me with the most beautiful and memorable kiss to be had. I felt so beautiful as he looked deeply in my eyes.I felt cherished as he held my face in his hands. That kiss took me to another world! We then walked into the sunshine and cheers of our family and friends. They celebrated us and threw confetti. Our car was decorated with streamers as we drove off to the reception. Every meal was perfect. Our friends had such beautiful words for us, as they raised a glass to toast us. We danced the night away with each other, and all who came to celebrate. Even my great -grandmother danced with us! I hold all of these things close in my heart. This is just the beginning of our life together. I hope that it sets the scene for many memories to come.",,35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58B0656U
