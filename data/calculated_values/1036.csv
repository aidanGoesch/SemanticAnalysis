That's not not all that one person you met and you just feel like there is a lot you have to share in your and you don't wanna lose that person for life it all complicated. I had to find a reason to make me happy. For the rest of my life till the day i met this girl whom i wanna share my experience on our wedding day. The day started as any normal day but it was full of events. Of which at the morning hours i had no idea whats gonna happen later. But briefly what carried my feelings on that day its the time i looked at her eyes and listen to her read her vow. I had that feeling that i have been looking for since then. That's the feeling i had for that one day it still fresh in my mind. Since then we are too used to each. We have never planned for another wedding even though it will never be the same. I  could return it back and enjoy that moment. But good memories come one a replay returns you back. But really leaves me wondering. What if this partner dies ?. Life is a circle. What happens next in such events like this.,,35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58B0656U
