The union subsequently discovered that this so-called boss was favoring certain employees over others during personnel evaluations.  The ""good ratings"" went to people who were this boss' friends.  Some workers would laugh at this boss' rotten sense (or attempt) at humor.  The jokes were so corny that it was impossible to find the random musings funny.  The boss' supervisors caught wind of the maltreatment of employees and eventually fired the boss.  How someone so incompetent could ever get promoted is beyond all comprehension.  Someone could be a bumbling fool/idiot and get promoted at this workplace.  However, hopefully the new corporate leaders can and will do something about such injustices.  Sally has worked that this hospital for 17 years and has never been promoted, despite her knowing more about her job than anyone!  Meanwhile for me, I found a job at a much more rewarding hospital and hope that my coworkers will be treated better in the future.  In fact, I just talked to Sally yesterday and she stated that things are starting to get better at my old workplace.  Let's just hope that Sally's hospital (and my former workplace) get better for all parties.  I do have hope that this is possible.  Anything is possible with the Lord.   Things happen for a reason, and what goes around comes around.  The Golden Rule is the Golden Rule, after all.",,35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58J5A65H
