I worked so hard to get my degree, struggling while working a job, taking care of two kids, my ex husband and my elderly mother in law. It was such a triumph when I got my degree. About six months ago, I lost my job due to the negligence of another nurse, and because of the belligerent new nurse manager who has had it in for me from day one. His firing of me was, I believe, retaliation for having gone to the union to report him last year. Allow me to explain what happened that caused me to lose my job. I worked in the psychiatric ward. I work, or worked rather, nights, and I am the charge nurse. This means of course that I am in charge. On the job I have my Assistant, or Nurse's Aide, and one other nurse. On slow nights, the hours drag and it can be very boring. On nights such as the full moon, it is pure chaos. The night in question happened to be a slow night, as we had only three patients and all of them were in bed asleep. During the course of the night, a fourth patient was admitted. This woman, in my informed opinion, was not so much having a mental episode, but was high on drugs. She did have some signs of mental illness. She was quiet and sweet, and just sat on the floor near our station counter, drawing artwork. On this particular night my Nurse's Aide wasn't there, and it was only me and the other nurse. I got sick during the night and had to go to the bathroom for an extended stay. The other nurse's job was to cover our station and maintain order. However while I was gone, the patient escaped. The other nurse did not even notice her get up, steal her keys from off the counter, unlock the door and leave. Nothing bad happened to the patient; she called someone from home and they came and picked her up. The next day she called to say that she wanted her cellphone back as she had left it when she escaped. Still because I am the charge nurse, both I and the other nurse were fired.",35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58J5A65H,35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58J5A65H
