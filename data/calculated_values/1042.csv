It was an emotional moment for me and my brother, who was the father. Seeing a new family member brought into the world was very touching and exciting. She is very cute and a calm baby. That is unusual but no one is really complaining. I was the second person to hold her. She was very light and delicate. It was hard not to tear up. I can't believe he's had his first kid! Maybe soon I'll have my first kid and he'll be thinking the same about me. I don't think that'll be anytime soon. I wish I could hold onto that memory of holding her for the first time forever, especially when she's older. After getting home I could barely hold in my excitement. I will be watching her when they need a break so that will be fun. I can't wait.",35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYHS8EF7,35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYHS8EF7
