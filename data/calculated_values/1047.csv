Having struggled with the passage of time, and my inexorable march to the grave over much of my adult life, there have been occasions when the clouds have parted, permitting fleeting shafts of light to fall before me. Last month was one of those occasions. That night, my beloved wife took me out for dinner to Poochy's Buffet, my all-time favorite family restaurant. Since we have no kids of our own, we dressed our child-like dolls in their finest embellished tweed jumpsuits and packed them into the back of my 1975 Cutlas Supreme, and away we sped to a very fine dining experience, and nothing more... Or so I thought! When we arrived, we carted our child-like dolls through the entrance of Poochy's Buffet and were asked to be seated against the back wall, as I detest eating with strangers behind me. After situating our child-like dolls on either side of us, and just as I was about to sit, I heard a boisterous commotion and witnessed the waitstaff cascading away in a choreographed series of movements to reveal my entire extended family doing a Russian dance routine and singing Happy Birthday! To me! What a perfect performance! What a perfect way to celebrate another year. Seeing their smiling face-- little Susie, little Tyler, fat Charlie-- it sent chills down my spine. We asked the waiters to push some tables together. I couldn't wait for the gifts, so I didn't let anyone eat until after my presents were opened. This angered the children severely, but it was my special day, not theirs. Afterwards, we all went our separate ways. Me and my wife packed our child-like dolls back into the car and came home. I am so blessed!",,35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYPX8EFP
