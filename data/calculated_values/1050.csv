I had been married to my husband for ten years but over the course of those ten years he changed. He was no longer the person I knew and it began to affect our children in a negative way. I could no longer set around the house and raise the children in such a toxic environment. I took the first step and signed a lease on a apartment. It was tough sleeping on the floor but I had to make this work. Over the next couple of weeks, friends started to bring over household supplies and some even bought furniture. My husband refused to let me have any stuff from the home. I was basically starting over again all these years later. Even though it was a rough time, I found strength inside of myself. My children seemed to laugh and smile more and there was no more fighting. I still have a long way to go because I have to be independent. I picked up a second job that I can work while the kids visit their father on the weekends. I've felt all the emotions involved in a divorce. However, I found power and independence as well.",,35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYYRREF5
