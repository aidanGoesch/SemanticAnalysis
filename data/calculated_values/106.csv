It was my sister, her boyfriend, and myself getting ready to enjoy a very American vacation. The next day was the 4th of July fireworks on the lake. The town had a special event every year where people would take their families out on the boats and huddle up in a cove near the town fairgrounds. From the fairgrounds they would launch off tons and tons of fireworks. All in perfect view for the huddled up boats. It was incredible to watch and such a unique experience. There were more boats than I ever remembered there being in the past. Boats blast off their own choice of song as the nearly 45 minute show continued, much to the enjoyment of everyone after a 10 minute disappointing show the previous year. Many people would bring foods to snack on and some would even have grills aboard their boats. It was such an American smell. The smell of fireworks, delicious food and a summer breeze. Seeing the fireworks reflect off the water is truly something else. You could also relax in the water on a raft during the show with the pitch black water below. It's truly a one of a kind experience unique to the area and something I'd gladly do again next year. We spent the rest of the time at the lake enjoying warm weather and family time as well as travelling in town for some antique stores.",30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFG7Z9JS,
