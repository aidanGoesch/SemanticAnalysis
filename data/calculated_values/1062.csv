Time for me to plan a trip that ill take for the year. I wanted to do something fun and original. Also i thought about going to in the off season because it was cheaper. So i planned on a surprise trip for myself the upcoming holiday of halloween. I will go where I can have the most fun wearing a costume since i love dressing up. This all started two weeks ago to think about it, and started with me wanting to dress up as a disney character. So i will stick to my original costume idea. And what is a better place to wear a disney costume then disney, i thought. So i made my decision and that is wear i will go. I will go with my family and since its cheaper they can all come. It will not be as hot so that will be a plus when wearing a costume. I will have everyone be Disney characters and make it a theme. It will be alot of fun and one of the best trips ever. Hopefully the trip there will be nice and smooth.",,35LDD5557BQEYC9GWBW5I8LC3C0MK3
