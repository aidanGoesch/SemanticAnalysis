I didn't have much money. I decided on a trip to disney's halloween party. My kids will enjoy it.  It is a bit of a tradition for us. We have been the last few years. We always dress in matching costumes. I usually make them myself. This year we are being characters from the moview descendants. I am almost done with all of the costumes. I hope it isn't too hot but I am sure it will be really hot being that it is september when we are going. The costumes have long sleeves. I am thinking of cutting them off so that I am not too hot. There will probably be some similar costumes but nothing the same. I have a cat watching me while I type.,35LDD5557BQEYC9GWBW5I8LC3C0MK3,35LDD5557BQEYC9GWBW5I8LC3C0MK3
