My wife finally revealed to me that she’s pregnant with our first baby by giving me a pregnancy test that proves she’s positive. How she did it? She asked me to take her out for dinner on a fancy restaurant and then she gave me a gift box with a bow on top of it and when I opened it, there’s the pt! I’m planning to surprise her with maternity dresses and baby stuff. As a soon to be “dad” I did a research about healthy pregnancy and parenting. After that day, we decided to tell our families that we are having a baby soon. Me and my wife started to think of baby names. Just because it’s our first baby, I made a design plan for our baby’s room. That is like the last piece of the puzzle I think because that little bundle of joy just completed not only me but our family. I enjoy the first month of my wife’s pregnancy because I give her extra care that she needs. We go to her doctor and buy her everything her body needs. Even if she has mood swings, I still enjoy it because I know it’s the baby. I love being a husband and a dad. I feel like I can’t wait for what’s ahead.                  -happened 1 month ago",,35LDD5557BQEYC9GWBW5I8LCFWLKM2
