I was a part of the wedding party. It was a lot of catching up with people I hadn't seen in awhile. It was more emotional than I expected.  I have been friends with him since high school and I have become very close to his wife in the last ten years.  It was at a very beautiful location with a waterfall in the background.  We spent the previous night at their house having a barbecue and drinking. That morning we went to eat at a great burger place and we basically drank the entire day. It was a lot of dancing once the reception came about. I danced the night away with a lot of the bridal party. I think the groom just wanted to have a party. I don't think he particularly wanted a wedding, but he really likes to party. The embarrassing moment was very embarrassing for me. It was during the time when people made toasts. I went to toast and I ended up breaking the glass in front of the entire audience. It was a royal embarrassment.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45U77Q6NI,
