We met online, on a popular dating app. We had been communicating regularly for about a month before I agreed to go out on a date with him. It had been a while since I had been on a date. I think I thought I would be nervous. However, I remember when I arrived to the restaurant, all of my nervousness dissipated. Anyways, the conversation seemed to flow relatively well. He made me laugh a lot, which is important to me. We talked about typical first date topics - work, hobbies, goals, current events, etc. At one point, he spilled some of his water onto the table. He seemed to be a bit nervous. The level of his nervousness surprised me, but we both immediately laughed about to lighten the mood. All in all, I had a very nice time. He let me know that he had had a great time as well. The end.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45UZD16NX,
