Upon arrival my mother had to pay for parking but we found a nice spot right near the beach.  We were also near the restrooms, which was great because I had to take a piss really bad. When I got in the bathroom I was surprised how clean it was given it was a bathroom on a beach.  I was also shocked how bright it was in the bathroom because I did not like seeing myself that clearly in the mirror when I went to wash my hands.  We walked along the beach and I looked for seashells but there were only tiny pieces of broken seashells along the shoreline. I got my feet in the water and it was very cold!  So I didn't go in any further, just continued to walk along the shoreline looking ahead when I spotted a couple dolphins swimming together. I saw a few kids on a boogie board in the water and laughed to myself because I thought about how they might get caught in an undertoe or get eaten by sharks.  It was surprising because it is a rare site in New Hampshire as the water is always too cold to see animals up close. I continued walking and we happened upon several small tidal pools which felt really warm when I stepped in them.  They were in front of a bunch of rocks.  There were many baby crabs in the tidal pool, about the size of a thumbnail. I also spotted a crab running away from the tidal pool. Later in the afternoon we got hungry so we left and stopped at McDonald's to get a hamburger for lunch.  Overall I really enjoyed my day and wish I could go back.",3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQ9LVIF0,
