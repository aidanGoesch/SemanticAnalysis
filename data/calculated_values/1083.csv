He told me that he was going to drop out of our high school and travel the world with his father's trust fund money. He said that he was looking forward to traveling to various exotic places, such as Bali and Bora Bora. I lamented the fact that I would likely never see him again, because I had just won a full-ride scholarship to Stanford University and would be in California for the next four years of my life. When Rachel found out about my scholarship, she spread a fake rumor around our high school that I had cheated my way into Stanford. I could not believe her audacity at snubbing me. I will keep holding a grudge against her. I look forward to the day that I can sabotage her career. I told my best friend Paulina the good news about my scholarship, but instead of being happy for me, she started crying. I reckon this is because she also applied for the scholarship but got rejected instead. We haven't talked since then, and I am conflicted between whether I should end our friendship or reach out to her first and make up. If we were to make up, the first thing I would do is bake her some cupcakes, because that is her favorite type of dessert. I would have to bake the cupcakes by myself, because I have no significant other to bake them with. Now that Richard is leaving forever, I  need to find a new secret crush so I do not have to do so many things by myself. What do you think, diary? Should I bake the cupcakes or let our friendship come to an end? Friends are harder to come by, the older I get. Sincerely, A confused girl",,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQE8EFIV
