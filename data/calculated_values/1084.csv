After following him for a few months, we bumped into each other.  We only talked for like two seconds, but I can tell that he is totally into me. Apart from that,  I just heard I won a scholarship.  Remember I went to write it a few days ago. The girls there are mean. I tried talking to one of them but she like totally snubbed me. I've decided G hat when I get to the school, I would do the same to her. Judging by the fact that I'm going to be super famous. My best friend and I had a fight today. I know im not supposed to feel hurt because I'm the strong one.  But it seems she is taking forever to apologize. In going to try as hard as possible not. Do think about her. Well that is it, see you tomorrow.",,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQE8EFIV
