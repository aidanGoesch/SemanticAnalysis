This happened a few months ago.  She was really falling behind on her bills and she came to me for help.  I had bailed her out a couple of times before but I kept telling her that she needs to learn to take care of her business.  She didn't learn apparently.  She asked me if I could loan her $2500.  I told her that I was strapped for cash at the moment and couldn't help her out.  She gut upset with me and we had a fight.  I told her that she needs to grow up and manage her finances instead of spending them frivolously.  She ended up getting out of the situation.  I don't know how she did it but she came to me a couple of weeks ago and told me that she was fine now.  She apologized for how she reacted when I couldn't help her.  She told me that she understood why I couldn't.  She mentioned that she managed to create a budget plan and shes actually saving a bit of money now.  I was very happy for her.  We made up and things are going well now.,,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQEYCIFC
