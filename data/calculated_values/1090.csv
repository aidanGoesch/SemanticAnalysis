Losing my cousin has changed my life in ways I could never describe. When she passed 6 weeks ago, I couldn’t eat—all I wanted to do was sleep. Sleeping helped me escape the reality of losing the person that had been there for me through everything. It’s been six weeks, and I finally feel like I can truly honor her memory. I am finally celebrating the life that she lived, the life that we lived together. I am unsure how I stopped grieving, but it will be the most memorable event of my life. I was sitting in my room painting and realized that I hadn’t cried, or thought of her tragic death. I felt a huge weight lifted off my chest. I could finally see again! I could finally remember the wonderful relationship I built with her. I was able to remember the good times and not only the bad. I was finally able to celebrate the life she had and how she impacted my life for the better. I will forever miss her, but I am no longer a prisoner in my own mind. I can finally move on and live my life the way she would have wanted.",,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQHQFIF2
