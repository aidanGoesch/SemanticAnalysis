I didn't realize how good though until about 3 weeks ago when I made a couple of videos. I wasn't planning on uploading them but family and friends were saying that I should. I've been getting a lot of encouragement and feedback lately and I think it's given me the confidence I needed to post more of my stuff online. Anyway, in total the two videos I uploaded got about 12,000, yes TWELVE THOUSANDDDD, views combined and I seriously could not believe it. It was mind blowing and surreal and was an even bigger boost to my confidence, not only in my playing, but in my social media page, which I hadn't honestly put much effort into prior. It was nice to see my talents recognized and appreciated. I really cannot wait to make more videos and see the response I get. I know it will be a challenge to get as many views again. I don't know if that was a chance thing or something I can expect to see happen each time. I don't want to get my hopes up. I will just continue to play what I love and hope people like it. I know this is the best way for people to see my true talent. I do hope I continue to get a lot of views though. It really is a confidence booster!",,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQHQXFIH
