I met a pro basball player while there. I had know idea who they were at first. But then someone told me who they were. It was amazing. I never met someone like that before. And I didn't know why they were in a foot locker. I had to measure their feet too. He got a great pair of sneakers. I felt like my day was made when I did it. If anyone was to give him shoes, I wanted to be the one. They were the priciest of sneakers that we had. They were good though, and I felt odd to be the one to help him out. I almost felt bad that I didn't know who he was. I am not a big sports nut. But it was great in any case.",,369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V46GA
