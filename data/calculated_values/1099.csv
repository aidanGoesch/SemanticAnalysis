The only people on the field were me, my boss, and two other people.  I had never met the other two people.  My boss then asked me if I had ever met ""him"". No I had never met ""him"" but the name sounds familiar.  I am then introduced to ""him"" and I'm thinking this dude is familiar. His handshake actually hurt my hand because he was so strong.  I shrugged off the short meeting and went on my way to continue doing my job while my hand was throbbing for a few minutes.  Throughout the day ""he"" ended up being an entertainer for the guests over the speaker system.   I was wondering why this guy was so important.  My last shift at work was in the back of the field in the bullpen.  I was doing a very easy job to help entertain some intoxicated folk.  As the event was coming to an end, my boss decided to have everyone give a big round of applause to ""him"". I stopped what I was doing when my boss said ""Him LastName"". I can't believe I met ""him"" and didn't even realize it! I'll never forgive myself.",369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V46GA,
