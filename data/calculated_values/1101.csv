He got on stage to get his diploma. A ton of people cheered. We did some things to celebrate. We first went to a nice burger place to eat. I got a double burger with lots of cheese. It was very greasy and delicious. He got a triple burger with a ton of cheese. He enjoyed it. We then went to the movies. We saw the latest blockbuster. It was a blast but it was a remake. The last thing we did was to go the park with the whole family. We played a game of football. My team won. I had a great time that day. My nephew said it was a ton of fun and would hope to do it again.",,369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V4G6K
