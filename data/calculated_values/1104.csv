It reminded my of a woman I met about four months ago at a local dog park. She had a little dog that she thought was suffering from a malignant tumor. I was able to interact with her dog before and after it had surgery and I was touched by the little thing. It was just so sweet and I couldn't help but think about how it must feel to be a dog and suffer like that. I mean you can't even tell someone when you are hurt or need help. It must be so frustrating for them. But, that little dog was just so loving and sweet. After the surgery, the little thing remembered me and came up to me with its little tail wagging. It seemed really happy to see me. I had wondered what I could do for the woman and her dog. I had gone to the pet store wanting to get a toy or some treats for the dog. The woman there suggested that I get the dog a bag of CBD treats. She said that it might help with his recovery. So, I gave them to the woman and her dog the next time I saw them.",,369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX7SHG6S
