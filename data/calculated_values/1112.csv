We went with him to the drugstore because I wanted to keep him company after his tooth extraction, and I also wanted to get my son out of the house for a little while. It was 10PM at night, and we went to the only place that was open with ibuprofen, which was the 7-Eleven. My husband went into the store while my son and I waited in the car. As my son and I were waiting in the car, I was singing The Wheels on the Bus with him, and we were having a little fun while we waited. I turned on the radio to my favorite hip hop station, but unfortunately that station was just static at this time. I turned off the radio and continued singing with my son. As we sang ""The driver on the bus goes move on back .. move on back .. move on ..."" I saw a car speeding towards as and I knew it was coming towards us. I had only a split second to think of what to do but I was too frozen to budge. The car whacked iteself into a pole and hit the front of our car. Glass was flying everywhere. Somehow, miracle striked, and only our windshield was damaged and the car was a little dent. The car wasn't even totaled, and neither my son nor I got hurt. My son actually slept through what had happened, which was some sort of miracle. Unfortunately, the other driver died, but he was driving while intoxicated and I can't bring myself to feel sorry for him or his family, because he put my family in serious danger, and all I can feel is relief that a drunk driver is off the road for good. Luckily, insurance covered for us, a rental car until our car was able to get fixed (and our insurance also covered the repair of our car).",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4U7YDS
