She helped me to be stable physically ans mentally. She was like a stress buster to me. It was a beautiful friendship. But it didn't last for long. There came a separation because of a new entry. She left me without a word. I felt hard without her. Things weren't so easy without her. I actually needed help. But later I managed to do all my works by myself. But when I found the real reason that why she left was unbelievable. She was actually a lesbian and had interest on me. And that is why she was with me through all my tough times but when she understood that I'm not one such like her, she left me all of a sudden. Its not that she is wrong because I'm not gonna peep into her bedroom but she could have at least left some last words.",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4UMYD7
