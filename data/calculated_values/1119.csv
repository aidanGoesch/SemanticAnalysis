I moved to another state and rented out my house. I plan on selling my house next yr too. I dumped my boyfriend. Now im thinking about selling my used undergarments. On top of that, I also do surveys online. I'm really looking for anyway to make money without getting a real job. I may consider being a sugar babe. Well, I do want to be one but I can't find a legit site. Prostitution is also an option. Im just scared that I will end up missing. Long story short, this move has made me realize that there are plenty of ways to make money online. that's pretty much it. my life is entrusting. and boring at the same time.",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDTVWWYDC
