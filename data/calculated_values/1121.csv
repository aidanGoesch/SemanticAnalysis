We weren't planning far out for it to happen, but opportunities just lined up so all four of us took a month off of work to take this trip. Tickets were booked. Plans were made. We scheduled family trips with our extended families in Korea. One of the parts of our trip that I was looking forward to the most was just driving down the coast of Korea in a rented car. In retrospect, that was one of my favorite parts of the trip. We stopped at resturants that we thought looked good. We just observed the landscape and went with no serious schedule. It felt good to not have to worry about work and just enjoy the weather and the views. Everything was interesting to see. We took a lot of pictures and we have them playing in a digital album in our dining room. It is fun seeing all the food that we ate and things that we saw. It reminds us that family vacations are very important. It is important to take care of each other and work hard so that we can make more moments like these. I don't know when our next vacation will be next. But I hope that we will all be healthy for it.",36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4BTQJOV,
