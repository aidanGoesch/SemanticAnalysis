He was stabbed in the chest and he bled to death on the way to the hospital. This was the most tragic thing that has happened to me in my whole life. It has been an absolute struggle ever since then. I am holding it together now, but barely. He was my only brother and I miss him more than words can really describe. It has been really tough on my mom and dad and it is for them that I try to stay strong. He was 18 year old  at the time of his death, which is just sad considering he had just celebrated his birthday the month before he died. Life can be really unfair sometime and at other times it can be even worse. People keep telling me that it will get easier, but I find that hard to believe. He was a prodigy at guitar and skateboarding. Those were my two major first obsessions and the moment I gave him a taste of each he easily outpaced me in both in no time at all. He had even been sponsored by a skate shop and got all of his skateboard stuff for free just for using it. He was my hero even though I was his older brother. I have no idea how i'm going to get by without him, but he will always be with me in my mind and heart. Sorry for such a depressing story, but it just dominates the major headlines of my last 6 months.",36NEMU28XGZ5TC3XLPF86JF7QJ9MWZ,36NEMU28XGZ5TC3XLPF86JF7QJ9MWZ
