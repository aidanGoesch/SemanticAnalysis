I met one person with a bad case of an addiction. She was addicted to heroin. I helped her get her footing in the world again. She got a job at Burger King. She hated it at first but got promoted within a year. She thanked me later with a free whopper. I was so proud of her. There was another case about a kid who was addicted to meth. I helped him get a job as a motivational speaker. He had a great time giving speeches about how you shouldn't use meth and other drugs. He is very popular now. He is doing great. I hope to help other people. This will be a long life.",,36PW28KO40IAAB8H3MVXBMD7PYFAEN
