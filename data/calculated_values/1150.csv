I miss the professors who used to bestow their knowledge unto me weekly as well as the different people I'd run into at any given time. I miss learning about various topics and broadening my horizons. One thing that I really found out though is that I really do enjoy learning about different cultures. My professors were from many different cultures and I had many of them who wouldn't mind sharing their stories with the class.  Not only that, but people from different backgrounds as well, such as poor, middle class, and rich. I really do miss many of my colleagues, who really were different from me in terms of backgrounds, race, some even from different countries. One thing I really liked about them was that If you ever had a question to ask about their culture, they wouldn't mind sharing , as long as you were respectful about it. My best friend in University was Asian and he's told me many stories about where he was from, and the thing's he used to do while there.  I would also share the same about where I'm from and my experiences from living in America.  We were truly like-minded in that way. I think these experiences will stick with me forever, as it isn't often that you get a chance to get out of your comfort zone the way University provides. It has really shaped my maturity and growth and I feel smarter for it. My knowledge of different cultures has shown me that I can see how others think and learn from them. They have served to make me far more open minded and broadened my horizons. Man, I really miss university.",,36TFCYNS45WYQY7C4XVHGXLIUDGXHY
