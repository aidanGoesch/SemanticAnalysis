We met up with grandma last weekend. We had a great time explaining what we have done since we last met. The wife got a new job. She is now a high level member of a marketing team. I got a promotion at the saw mill to top manager. I got a few more vacation days a year and get double the pay. Grandma  has been making quilts. They got famous on eBay and she has sold a lot of them. We cried about not seeing each other in so long. We had a nice ham dinner. We played some board games. We watched some television. We shared photos. After all of this, we said goodbye.",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J59CYK6
