We are both originally from the Pacific Northwest and about a decade ago we both had nothing and we flew across country with almost nothing to our names to start our life on the east coast. She had a sick grandmother that needed care and we stayed with her and made our life out there. About 6 months ago her grandmother passed away and we both kind of realized that we didn't really like living there, but we also couldn't leave her grandma alone. So we decided to pack up our stuff in our car and a u-haul and drive back to the Pacific Northwest since both of our families are here and they were sort of asking us to come back. I remember very vividly our drive back across the country. I had this moment where I just felt free, like a huge weight had been lifted off both of us. Her grandmother was really nice and helped us so much when we were young and lost in life, to be fully clear. However, after nearly a decade of taking care of her it was a huge relief to just be free to worry about ourselves and focus on our lives and our relationship fully. That trip was maybe the best 2 weeks of my life. We took our time and saw the sights from coast to coast but the best part was definitely our time spent at the grand canyon. I always thought something like that was neat but pretty boring but seeing it for myself at that specific time in my life with the woman I love is something I'll never forget. We made it safely back home and now we're busy starting our lives with our families near us. I'd say we're in the best spot we've ever been in as far as our relationship is concerned. I give a lot of that credit to that trip and my wife for being so understanding of how much of a dick I can be at times.",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J59CYK6
