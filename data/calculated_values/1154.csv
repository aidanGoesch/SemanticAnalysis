I had been involved in an online forum for video games, which I love, and started communicating to a few people regularly.  One of them was a girl around my same age who seemed to have similar tastes in games and other things.  We started chatting more and more and eventually it seemed like things were developing into romantic interest.  I've never been really good at that type of thing, so I was reluctant to pursue it in any way.  Besides, emotional connections are easy to elicit online.  Feeling ""warm and fuzzies"" about someone online, just based on their writing and the created image you have of them, isn't the basis of real love or connection.  It's very artificial.  Nonetheless, after spending more and more time online with her, sometimes hours per day, Skyping, texting, and communicating every way possible, even I was thinking we both had real feelings for each other.  I mustered up all my courage and expressed my feelings for her and she said she felt the same way.  I was relieved, ecstatic, and panicked all at the same time.  After getting over the initial shock and relief, I started thinking about how to proceed.  Eventually I convinced her to let me come see her in Sweden, where she was from.  She was amenable to the idea although never jubilant about it, which, in hindsight, I should have taken as a warning sign.  Instead, I plowed ahead, full speed, blinded by my feelings and excitement.  To make a long story short, she was supposed to meet me at the airport.  But she wasn't there.  I texted her and got no reply; I phoned her and got no answer.  At that point I was panicking a little, thinking something had happened to her, not realizing that the disaster was happening to me.  I ended up actually getting a hotel room because I didn't know what else to do.  I actually didn't even know where she lived at the time.  But when I got to my hotel room, after a few days, I started to get angry instead of worried.  So I put on my internet detective hat and searched the internet to find out her address.  I went to her place and camped out, waiting to see if she'd show up.  At that point I saw her coming out of an apartment, being playful and hugging a guy who was clearly her boyfriend, and she was pregnant--I absolutely broke down at that point, flew home, and never talked to her again.",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J707KY7
