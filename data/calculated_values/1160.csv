Lately that phrase seems more real to me than ever after my closest uncle died last week. Of all my relatives on that side of the family I would say my uncle was the person I was closest to. We often attended football games together, usually joined by my two brothers. It's a tough loss to say the least. He lived to be 85 years old and had a very rich and full life. But his passing really is nothing but an eye opener for me and some of my siblings. My uncle's generation doesn't really have many more people left in my family that are alive. That means my generation is next on deck in some way. I spoke with my older brother about this a few days ago and it's definitely distressing for both of us. Whether we think we know it or not, time flies much too quickly. It seemed like just a few years ago my uncle was in his 60's and I was in my late 30's. Now I'm the one who is nearly 60 years old. It's frustrating, but I guess that's just how life works. I know my uncle's passing really opened my eyes about some things, and I'm just hopeful I can live as long and as well as he did.",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JDGYKY0
