I remember this event clearly, and I remember writing about it, and what I felt at the time.  It was indeed very momentous.  At the time I felt keenly the passage of time, and as I realized my brothers (some now in their 50s, more on that momentarily) and I were now the main or prime generation of family, I felt melancholic, and brooded about my own mortality. With the passage of time since the funeral some of the weightiness of thoughts of mortality has waned and I am left with a different perspective and reflections on the event. One, how important it was to get together with all my brothers: this hardly ever happens. that we are all together. It was also important and a very rare occurrence to get together with all the cousins on that side of my family. It may be the first and last time that happens. With distance I also realized that some of my angst about mortality stemmed from a compounding effect--the funeral was the same week as my brother Joe's 50th birthday. I am the next up to hit this milestone.  This is part of the reason I connected it with my own mortality so much.  It was also an odd conicidence that they both occurred in the same week. I am still a little overly concerned about my own death. But it has waned some since the funeral.",36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JDGYKY0,
