Before we even got to the day of, my wife's best friend texted her apologizing for not being able to make it to her party, which led to a bunch of questions from my wife and a spoiled secret birthday surprise. Nonetheless, we pressed on and had a bunch of her friends come out and I saved a small surprise for the day of. My sister came to visit from out of town the weekend of the party so I was running around like mad to prepare, all the while trying to show my sister around town and get in a bit of sightseeing. I spent far too much on decorations to get giant foil ""30"" balloons since you only turn thirty once and I wanted to go all out for my wife, and just before we left for the party we picked up the final, most important part of the party: the ice cream cake with a custom picture printed on the front. Now, my wife and her friends have had a long running inside joke with her college friends about a guy they were classmates with. This guy made YouTube videos back when they were in college that have become infamous among their friend group, and only one remains on YouTube to this day. I've seen the video a hundred times since it somehow always comes up and we watch it whenever enough of her friends from college get together and start riffing about the days they were in school together. So my genius self decided to screenshot a still from the video and get it printed on my wife's birthday cake as a surprise since the surprise birthday didn't quite work out. We went to the party and I made sure my wife didn't see the cake the entire time we were there. I did my best to get all the food prepared and set out and make sure everyone had drinks and my sister didn't feel left out or awkward, all the while waiting for the moment I could reveal the cake. Later into the evening, the moment finally felt right to bring the cake out but I wanted to get the video playing first just for that extra effect when I brought the cake out. I asked one of my wife's friends for help bringing up the video, who brought over a different friend who, I kid you not, said ""Yeah definitely, give me like 2 minutes"" and 30 seconds later, got my wife to bring up her classmate who made the YouTube videos. A few moments later, the video was up on the TV and my plan was set in motion. I hung back a bit as we watched the video so I could escape away unnoticed and prepare the cake with candles. When I brought the cake out after the video ended, we all sang happy birthday and as I set down the cake my wife began to howl with laughter. Everyone was in tears laughing at the cake and the picture on it of the video we had just watched moments ago. Even though I didn't pull off the surprise party, the surprise cake was just as sweet a victory.",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JDL4YKU
