My parents told me that I couldn't have one for years and years, but getting my pet bunny in a magic show two months ago was so cool! The magician made a rabbit disappear and then reappear under my seat, and they let me adopt it after the show! My mom originally gave me a dirty look, but she couldn't say no to that cuddly little face. They even let me and my mom meet the magician and other assistants backstage. They did a pretty cool trick for me with a red ball that they didn't do during the show. My mom was blown away! When we got home my dad wasn't exactly thrilled about the bunny, especially since the little guy pooped on the kitchen floor right when we walked in. I had to clean it up, which was pretty gross. My parents told me they were happy that I was being responsible. The next morning we went shopping for supplies at the local pet store. Mom and dad were pretty cool about it too, and let me pick out a nice cage, a bunch of specific food, and some toys. The cage I got is massive and has multiple spots for food trays, which is perfect. It's just so funny how my parents always said I wasn't responsible enough to have a dog or a cat, and now I have a bunny. I'm just glad they came to their senses!",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JE3PYKG
