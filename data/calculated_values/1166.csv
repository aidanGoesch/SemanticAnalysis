Well, rabbits, don't really have paws, they only have hair on the skin that covers the bones. Me and my family were so scared and felt really bad for her. We did not know what was causing her that and how painful it could be. We started researching on the internet and found really bad news. Rabbits are very prone to suffer from dermatitis and in many cases it that not have a cure. That broke our hearts. We really loved her and we didn't want her to suffer pain or die. Thank God, on Facebook we found a rabbits's lovers group in which they recommended a great vet that was specialist on exotic animals. We called him right away and told him what was happening. He told us that it was very urgent to take her to his clinic for assistance,  so we booked an appointment for the next day. My mom had to ask for permission from work. I was working in the afternoon shift, so we could take her together. It was a very expensive rate compared to a check for a dog or a cat, but we didn't care. It was really  hard to put my rabbit in the crate for transport, so we arrived late to the appointment. We were so worried we would lose the turn. We knew that Olivia was feeling pain and that was killing us. the doctor was waiting for us, he explained us what happened and washed her feet. We gave her the medicines and her wounds healed in about one week. We are so happy to have found that vet.",36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JE3PYKG,
