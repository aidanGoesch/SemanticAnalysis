On his wedding, he goes not reachable and peoples who came to attend his wedding go confused. Some people were taught that the groom got abscond. I travelled long for his wedding and I tried to reach him. In this crazy moment, people vacate the premises too.  On this rush and confusing period the groom has reached in the church where the wedding was held. We peoples every one surprised when he reached on time. This wedding scenario became a most thrillful wedding I ever go. After some horrible experience, that wedding done the best way. Every one in the premises for wedding ceremony got excited when that wedding done. Even after this two weeks we mocked him. But, not for his fatness, for this abscond. What happened is happiness. But, we experienced some new wedding moments. My friends and our cousin still call me asking about my obsessed brother.",,36V4Q8R5ZLM09F7B9GG2EUXLE2BQMY
