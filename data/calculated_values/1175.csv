My son was about six months old at the time, so this was really his first introduction to pools or any sort of water outside of the bath. He was very receptive to the whole experience. He didn't cry, and was more interested in observing the other kids in the pool. I was surprised at how observant he was. The fact that he was simply taking in the whole experience was wonderful. It was suggested that I briefly put his face in the water, and to my surprise, he seemed to enjoy it! This was a very special experience for me because I remember going to pools and swimming in creeks and lakes when I was a kid. I'm glad that he was okay being almost entirely submerged in the water. This was one event that I was really looking forward to before he was born. Since he was born in December, I was worried that he might not be old enough to do swim lessons this past summer. But I'm very glad that we didn't have to wait until next year. I felt like he really relied on me in that pool. Up until that time, my wife was always there to help me with parenting if I run into trouble. This was my first real time being the primary parent. All in all, it was a very positive experience and I'm glad I got to be the one to introduce him to the swimming pool.",,36V4Q8R5ZLM09F7B9GG2EUXLEW3MQA
