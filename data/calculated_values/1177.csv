It was a while since we had done another together and relaxing. It was memorable because I felt so content and happy, which I have not felt like in a long time. The best part was the ride back home with my wife leaning on me taking a nap. This was special to me because it was a lovers embrace while I was driving and how we were both super warm, tired, and content. This stands out to me because of the reasons I mentioned but also because my wife is my best friend and with the move recently and school we have been super busy. This made doing anything fun or relaxing quite difficult. Also, being closer to a beach now compared to before is nice. We are able to do more. The first thing we needed though was a beach day. The swimming and tanning was wonderful. It was nice and quiet. No loud music. Just the sound of the waves and wind. It was a really nice day.",,36V4Q8R5ZLM09F7B9GG2EUXLUB6QMR
