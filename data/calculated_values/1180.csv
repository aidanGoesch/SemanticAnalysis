I thought I was having a heart attack. It all started because I was keeping my emotions bottled up. I was under a ton of stress with moving and work, and O felt like I should be able to handle it all. So, I chose to keep all the stress in and not tell anyone how I was feeling. I was packing some boxes when all of a sudden it hit me. My chest got really tight, and my breathing went crazy. I couldn't see straight, and I started freaking out. My husband asked me what was wrong but I couldn't talk, all I could do was shake my head and clutch my chest. My husband called 911 and the paramedics arrived and checked me out. They gave me oxygen and checked my blood pressure. One of them told me it was ok just try to breathe normal. Finally, things started letting up and I was breathing normal again. I started crying and told the paramedics how sorry I was that he had to waste his time to come out. He assured me it was all a part of his job and that he thought I was having an anxiety attack. I felt embarrassed but he assured me it was nothing to be ashamed of and I needed to get things under control or it could lead to worse things like a heart attack. Now, I will always make sure I take care of myself and let things out, talk about my stresses to my husband so this doesn't happen again.",,36W0OB37HX0NVT7R5FJ2DI1T2DSZHB
