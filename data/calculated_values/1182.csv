I really wish that the hospital would take into consideration of what I am going through.  My cancer seems to always be one step ahead of me.  Sometimes I wish that I could just end it all but then I think about my loved ones, children, and friends.  Life was  never meant to be easy but it seems that I always get the short end of the stick.  Thank goodness I have God in my life.  HE ensures my comfort and i know that without Him I would not have made it this far.  I pray every day and every night and give my thanks.  I realize all of my gifts that i have been granted in life.  even though my cancer is still prevalent in my life I know that all is good.  I hope that hospital realizes how they are impacting others lives.  Maybe had I received my chemo, my cancer could be in remission.  My breathing problems seem to have subsided but only slightly.  Hopefully when I go to my new doctor, they can whip me back into shape.  I heard great reviews about them and am anxious to get there.  God bless",,36W0OB37HX0NVT7R5FJ2DI1T2EKHZN
