I couldn't believe that when I read it on Facebook! When I saw it, I called his wife first thing and asked about Alex. Apparently, he has had his jaw wire removed and is doing better. He has to eat non-solid foods for a month but overall is getting better. I asked what had happened to him. His wife told me that he had started a new construction job a few months before this. They weren't allowing the newer people to the construction site until they all took tests and safety courses. Alex had done these before with the company and instead of giving the refresher, they went ahead and let him do the jobs. Well, he had forgotten about a helmet and went he bent down to pick up a tool, he got smashed in the front of his face with a steel beam. The beam was being rose from the ground to the next floor and someone had given the ""all clear"" despite Alex being there. The beam smashed him in the chin and jaw and did some damage. It was minor compared to what it could have been! I was so surprised to hear about this! I asked if they needed anything and she said they were doing well.",,36W0OB37HX0NVT7R5FJ2DI1TQPSZHN
