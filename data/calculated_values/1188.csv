I've been dating a new guy for a few weeks, and I really wanted him to have a chance to meet her since she is so important in my life. We decided to go out for dinner last week, and things could not have gone better. I wasn't really nervous about introducing them because many of our friends say we're like two peas in a pod. I knew he would adore her as much as I do. At dinner, he was very charming and polite to her. He made sure to show his humorous side, which helped her get comfortable. They laughed and joked a lot, and we had a very good time. I think the best part of the night was after dinner. We decided to go to her house to drink some coffee. She has a little dog named Bailey, and he doesn't really like new people. When my boyfriend sat down on the couch, however, Bailey was immediately taken with him. He probably enjoyed meeting Bailey more than he did my friend! They played fetch for what felt like hours. After we drank our coffee, we took Bailey on a walk in the neighborhood. It was the perfect end to a perfect night! I can see the three of us having a very close friendship together!",,36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD11KEB6
