Though the plan was executed two months back, the plan was nearly under consideration for six months. Because if a person has time another does not have. So it was a hectic process to make everyone available. The time came two months ago. Finally we packed everything and went to the trip. My uncle and aunt also joined the trip. It was really amusing until that incident occurred. Everyone were enjoying in the beach. My father in law suddenly held his chest and fell down. Everyone was shocked for a second. After coming out from shock we shouted for help. Immediately everyone gathered around and asked about the problem. Fortunately a doctor was present in the crowd. He came and checked my father in law and gave first aid. Soon my father in law came to conscious and we took him to the nearby hospital for further checkup.",,36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD8CYEBD
