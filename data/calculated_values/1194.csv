Helping my brother and sister in law out with the kids was both a blessing and a punishment. It had been a long time since I babysat and now I remember why. I am exhausted. The kids were sooo bad and so spoiled. They sure were not used to my kind of shopping and cooking. I took the little guy shopping and he started to cry when I picked up apples. He demanded grapples. What the heck is a grapple? And parmigano regiano cheese? Not in my house kiddo.  Part of me feels like a bad aunt, but part o me knows that I taught them things they needed to know.  They were horrified when I walked outside barefoot, this really amused me.  I love them more than anything, we had some really great times. But I honestly do not think I can do that again,at least not or just a few hours a week. And their mom would have to pack their lunches.",,36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD9X4BEN
