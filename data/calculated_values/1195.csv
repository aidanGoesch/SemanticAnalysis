Was a great trip. They already nned me to go to the store for them. Nobody home yet. He won't be back until late, same as my sister-in-law. When the nephew gets home, need to get him a snack and take him to swim practice. At least my niece isn't going anywhere tonight. They'll be picking up pizza on the way home. I guess my brother will pick up my nephew, as well. Well, we didnt eat until 8pm. Didn't even have much time to talk with the family. Looks like we are taking the kids to the park tomorrow so everyone wants to get sleeping early tonight. Well, the next day we spent 8 hrs at the park. Man, I was so tired. Went on a few rides which I will not do again. Had to do it for the kids, though. They think I'm the cool uncle so had to live up to the hype. It was fun over all. Needed some fun cause the rest of the week was me playing the role of chauffer. I need to take my niece and nephew to two different events everyday, and pick them up when they are done. Some I stayed to watch but other times I went back to the house to get some swimming in mysel. It is hot down in the soth and is great that they have a pool. Well, the 2 weeks just flew by and and time for me to head back north. Not used to that kind of hussle and bussle. Great to be back home, though.",36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD9X4BEN,
