It's so crazy how time is a test of patience. Time really does heal all things. I'm excited to see what the future holds. Looking back, after so many months of depressive episodes, therapy, and criticism from them, I'm finally content with my life, and I'm finally accepted. I've lived my whole life pretending to be fine, and conforming to societal norms. Who would've thought mom and dad would accept me in due time. Growing up with conservative, strict parents, and living a culture where LGBTQ+ is frowned upon, this is a mile stone in creating a narrative within the family that everyone is different, and everyone is beautiful, regardless of gender identity and sexuality. I'm looking forward to the months, and years ahead as I further my transition. What will my 24th birthday be like? Where will I go from here? And do I have the courage to be the voice of young Asians who are going through the same process and transition as I am? Is Vietnam ready to open their minds to a world outside of their microcosm? It will be a trek to get that far, but I don't think it's impossible. Thinking about the younger children within the family, I need to set an example for them. Everything will be okay, as long as you don't lose yourself in the process.",,36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD9YMBE7
