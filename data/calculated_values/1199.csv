I was originally in my college town. I stayed there for six years after graduation. I needed a new start somewhere. New places and things to do. The change was quite large at first. All the familiar things were gone. From friend to locations. But the new people I met and the new sense of freedom helped. I needed to get a set of new patterns. I think that a new location was perfect for this. I think it was the right choice. I still keep in touch with old friends. Ones that are still there and the ones that moved long ago. I feel it was a good thing in my life and glad I did it.,,373ERPL3YPU4YBCVVS6E5Y2ISCSTR6
