Though I was in my early 20s, I felt like a kid playing the part of a college-graduated adult. I had few friends to lean on for support, and those I did have had become more distant and unavailable. Because I had no idea what else to do, I remained in my college town for another year and a half. This began as a very dark time for me, but I slowly began to move away from depression and engage with life more and more. I started a new relationship during this time, and we decided to move to a new city once she graduated. We picked a place we had no connections to but were interested in exploring, and we began to look for apartments while saving up for a deposit. It was scary but exciting to not know where we would end up or if we would even be able to find a place to live before our lease was up in our college town. In the last week of the lease, we were able to sign on for a new apartment. After an arduous moving process, we stopped to get some groceries for the new place. I started feeling scared then at this new unfamiliarity I had moved into. The things I had been surrounded with for the past 6 years were gone, and I wasn't sure how I would fit into this new life. I had no idea where I would find work or if I would be able to pay rent in the next month. The apartment was several miles outside of the city I wanted to live in, and it was in a pretty rural. It had no windows and felt stuffy and suffocating. It was filled with spiders and other bugs that we were never able to fully get rid of. It was small and cramped but not in the cozy way that some of my previous residences were. This was the beginning of another dark period in my life, and I started feeling more and more stuck in my thoughts and patterns the same way I felt stuck in the apartment and the countryside. I felt really isolated from everything despite my efforts to go out and engage in the world.",373ERPL3YPU4YBCVVS6E5Y2ISCSTR6,
