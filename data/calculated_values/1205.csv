I have never had such a great experience before. I was elated, and it was my wife's first child too. I held him in my hands, and cried. I was filled with emotions. I never thought it would be so great. I could not let the child go. It was a boy, and I loved that too. My wife was weak from childbirth. I held her close, and she lit up. WE were the most happy we have ever been. We loved making a child. We can not wait to have another. She is not looking forward to leaving the child. We will be happy to make a girl next time. HOwever, either one is fine.",,374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKS4F4YQY
