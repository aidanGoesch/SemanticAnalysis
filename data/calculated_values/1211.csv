I am so glad that she is taking it so well. I was scared at first but now I have no worries about her going to school. As for me growing as a parent I feel like I am doing a decent job. I defiantly have some more things to learn but feel I am in a pretty good spot now. I miss my daughter now that she is in school but I know that it is good she is being exposed to kids her own age and also learning things at the same time. I really hope we continue to stay as close to each other as we were before school. I feel like we will and that I am worrying over something that isn't a big deal. I look forward to continuing to grow as a person and a parent and also making sure my daughter is enjoying and learning in school.,,374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSD98QYR
