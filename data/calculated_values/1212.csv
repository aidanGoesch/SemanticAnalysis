This was a big event for our household, as our child has always been in my care exclusively.  It felt painful to send her away for a 6 hour school day. I wondered if she was happy, listened to, understood,  if she was hungry for a snack that she was accustomed to having, if she made friends, who she played with at recess, etc. I kept busy at home with my younger daughter,  but our routine was fractured. My daughter was missing her big sister,  and I was missing my big girl who helped me with her little sister.  During the first week of school, I reminded myself that this was my big girl's new chapter in life, her journey to growing into a big kid. This right of passage was to be expected,  and that we all have survived without our parents watchful eyes. I found it interesting that we spend so much of our child's early years carefully watching over them, only to have to release that nurturing grip to a stranger. As funny as it sounds, I had think back to my years in elementary school. I considered what my parents had to do, releasing my care to strangers, and it helped me bridge this new chapter that I was on the other end with my child. I was able to better prepare my child and myself for this new schedule. The daily pep talks calmed my inner mama bear. I no longer fought with anticipation to camp out at her school, just a good joke to remind myself that she was fine and I would be as well. Now that she is 3 months into this new routine, we are satisfied, she is in love with her school, and I feel like the competent mama bear that I knew I would be.",374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSD98QYR,
