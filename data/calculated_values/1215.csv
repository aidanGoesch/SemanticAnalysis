When he asked me to back it up a bit, as I was turning around the weight of the trailer threw the dolly towards the trailer and sent me flying.  As I was falling, my head hit the trailer hard.  As I fell on the ground, I instantly knew I had broke my arm. My Mom called 9-1-1 while the pain I felt equaled child birth or kidney stones!  Finally the ambulance arrived. On the ride in, every bump he hit caused so much pain!  The ER did an incredible job. First I had an MRI to check on the extent of my head injury. Then they x-ray'd my arm. That was tough because I didn't want the technicians to touch my arm but they did an outstanding job.  Finally the doctor came in and said I had sustained a catastrophic injury.  Both my ulna and radial bones in my right arm had snapped in half!  I couldn't believe it.  I had absolutely no support in my arm. He said Slocum Orthopedic would be calling me the next day as I would need surgery.  He also put two staples in my head and home I went.  Needless to say, I didn't sleep that well.  At 7:30am the next morning, I received a call from Slocum.  They wanted me in to see the doctor at 10:05am. My friend came and drove me into the appointment.  I found myself laying in the operating room having surgery at 2:15pm that day. Now began the process of rehab and getting full use of my dominant arm back.",,374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSN7XQYM
