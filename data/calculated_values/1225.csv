The candidate at the event was in Downtown Los Angeles at a park. I had seen many interviews with him online before I attended the rally. I started to believe in his vision when I heard him on podcasts. I had never gone to a political event in my life but was really encouraged to attend this one. A big reason that motivated me was the fact that he was spreading a message that was so profound but no one else knew about. He had no political background so his name recognition was next to nothing. I didn't want to tell too much people about it because I didn't think that they would care enough to come with me. I only told one friend who I knew would be interested. The scene at the rally was amazing. It included so many people from different backgrounds. I'm not religious at all but it felt like we were listening to the words of our savior. Everything he said made so much sense. As the event ended, the crowd cheered ""ANDREW YANG"". There was so much energy on the train ride back home. I never knew that politics could be that impactful.",379J5II41P2R6UZL0DKNK0TIB3SLE8,
