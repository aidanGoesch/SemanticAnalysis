It was an overcast afternoon and a light rain had just started to fall. With prettily wrapped French pastries in hand, I was looking for a place to sit and enjoy my treat. My traveling companion suggested an uncovered bench next to a small reflecting pool. I suggested a well-covered bench about 10 feet away. Much to my chagrin, my companion forced me to the uncovered bench. After sitting down, I quickly opened our treats. When I turned back to face my companion, he was not on the bench; rather, he was on one knee in front of me holding a Claddagh ring&#151the Irish wedding bandAfter Jeff, my traveling companion and boyfriend of three years, asked me to marry him, I was speechless. I was so drawn into the beauty of the moment that it took me a few seconds to respond. But, after much hugging and kissing, I said, “YesJeff and I set our wedding date for Aug. 11, 2001. That meant that I would have less than a year and a half to plan a wedding, keep everything in order and enjoy the moment. From that moment on, every childhood fantasy of my wedding day was coming at me at lightning speed. I knew then that I would need to do something to stay organized and to remember every moment of the most wonderful time in my life. That’s when I turned to a wedding journal. When I tried to keep journals in the past, I would just use a notebook or loose paper, only to find that a month later I had either abandoned the notebook or lost the sheets of paper. So, this time I decided to take a different route when a friend gave me To Have and to Hold, A Wedding Journal. Ironically, but appropriately, the guided journal is published by the My Chaotic Life division of Walter Foster Publishing. I soon found out that chaos is the catchphrase when you are planning a wedding. I enjoyed using a guided journal for discipline, but using a journal that is blank inside is just as helpful. I know because I kept one of those, tooThe guided journal helped to keep me focused but I soon discovered that there were things missing that I really wanted to include. For example, Jeff and I decided to write a short piece that we would read to each other after we exchanged our vows. There wasn’t a space in the guided journal for me to jot down thoughts or ideas for this “untraditional” element, so I added notes on this into the pages of my personal wedding journal. Having space to explore my ideas helped me to write those special words",,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0LNED6T
