I made the suggestion to go there since I know the owners and many of the people who work there. We had our lunch and needing to get back to work. We needed our check and the sopapillas that come with the lunch. It was busy there and all the staff was running around like crazy. There was a young busboy working and Mike wanted to get his attention so he could get our server. Instead of saying excuse me or just waving, he yelled ""hey, Pedro!"" I couldn't believe it and I was sick inside. I told him how inappropriate and demeaning it was and he, seriously, didn't see anything wrong with it. We talked about it for awhile after but he just didn't agree with me. I think that bothered me more than anything. He thought it was okay. He thought I was being ridiculous and nothing I said seemed to hit home with him. I never really cared to be around him after that day. I apologized to the young boy and some other people but I was still so ashamed of his behavior. It still bothers me to this day.",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3OD67,
