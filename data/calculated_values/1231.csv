We were at a Mexican restaurant where my husband and I go, frequently. There are some very nice people who work there and they all know me by sight and are always smiling and friendly. Mike, along with several other co-workers, and I went to this restaurant because I suggested it would be a great place to have lunch. As usual, everything was going great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Towards the end of our lunch, it started getting really busy. We were almost done eating and wanted to get our sopapillas and our check so we could get back to work. There was a busboy running around trying to keep ahead of all the customers so Mike decides to get the busboy's attention. He yells out, ""Hey, Pedro!"" to this young kid. I was absolutely mortified. I asked what the hell he was doing and he said he calls all Hisphanic guys, Pedro. He didn't see anything wrong with it. I did tell him how insensitive his remark was but he thought I was being overly-sensitive. I wanted to crawl under a rock. When we were leaving, I apologized to the young busboy and to everyone else I could see. When we got back to work, we continued to discuss the issue and I don't think I ever got through to him. I have never felt the same about him from that day forward. I know he felt the same about me.",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3OD67,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3OD67
