They have a worker in. Waste of working capacity and forces; refusing to have a pleasant pastime. the severity of labor, and other unpleasant feelings that accompany him. The capitalist’s main negative emotions are due to the fact that he should not most of the profit (income), and invest in production with a risk for yourself. The demand for final products is determined by such factors of production – rent, salary, profit. But the prices of these factors themselves determine consumer demand, because they form the income of the population. Marshall was the one who tried to solve this problem. He looked at her with the other side. Rent, salary, profit is really income of different groups of the population. But this is also a component of the cost of production. It turns out that the costs still, albeit indirectly, but affect the demand. But at the same time they directly affect the market supply. This is obvious, because the higher the costs, the less volume of production, which the capitalist is ready to produce at the same price. And for a definite threshold of the sum of costs, production ceases altogether. Can say that if costs affect both demand and supply, they are at the heart of the pricing. Thus, the utility and costs are two blades of scissors. Utility (need) forms demand, costs form a proposal. Each consumer himself determines his demand curve for each type of product. Her the value depends: on the budget of the consumer and the need for this product. As to each volume of the goods the certain price which suits the average consumer, the so-called demand price, then we can say that the same quantity of goods must meet a certain price that suits producer, that is, the price of the offer. However, in the second case, it is logical to say, that the relationship between the volume and the price of the offer is direct. The intersection point of the two curves will represent the situation when the most ideal price, or close to the ideal, according to which all subjects of economic relations are ready to interact. This is the point of market equilibrium, which is a determining factor in the study of market conditions. With such a mutual arrangement of the demand and supply curves shows readiness of consumers to purchase this product or service, and the producer is ready to give to the market. Speaking about the fact that the equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved only in one",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3Q6D2,
