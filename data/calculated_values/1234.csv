Purpose   The purpose of this experiment was to find the empirical formula of a hydrous copper sulfate by finding the percent water, which is done by determining how much the mass of the sample changed after heating it. Finding the percent copper spectrophotometrically using ammonium hydroxide to increase the sensitivity of the technique or method for copper. Lastly, finding the percent of sulfate by precipitating it with barium from added barium chloride. II Procedure	Percent Water An empty cleaned crucible was on a very high heat in order to remove any substance or left-over samples. Then hydrous sulfate was weighted and added to the crucible and heat it with a gentle flame (approx. 150C). The sample was monitored to maintain a very light blue or white. If the sample is green or yellow the copper sulfate had decomposed; start over. After the sample was cooled, reweight the sample and it must be no more than 2mg.

The Standard solutions differ in amount of stock in each. The new solutions were discharged back and forth between the graduated cylinder and mix the solution well. The final standard solution will be a non-diluted sample of the primary stock solutionnNH_3+Cu(H_2 O) 6^(2+)→Cu(H_2 〖O)〗_(6-n) (NH_3 ) n^(2+)+nH_2 O	Preparing the Unknown Hydrous Copper Sulfate SolutionThe other partner did prepare his own unknown solution. I add copper sulfate (approximately 0.06g), add 0.5 M NH_3 solution (approximately 25mL) in a 50mL graduated cylinder and kept stirring until all of the particles dissolved. The absorbance of this sample will be measured, and its concentration will be determined from the Beer’s law graph.	Using Colorimeter I was using the LabQuest app for Colorimeter. I need to wait 5 minutes before I calibrate the samples. Insert the first sample in the cuvette slot and once the reading stabilized tap on the KEEP button and enter the concentration. Repeat this procedure for the rest of the samples. The absorbance and concentration will create a Beer’s Law Graph.	Percent Copper in ExcelRecord the absorbance of the 5 samples including the unknown solution. Create an Excel Graph of Absorbance vs. Concentration. I included the trendline and r-squared value of my graph.",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3Q6D2,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3Q6D2
