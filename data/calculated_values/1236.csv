However with the encouragement of my sister in law I periodically kept texting Hannah and just a few months ago she began responding. I am most thankful for her advice and support and now she and I are messaging on a regular basis and beginning to restore our relationship. In 2016 I took up a new hobby of making walking sticks from trees in which ever area of the country we happened to be in. Since we travel ever few months for work this means a selection of unique woods to work with. I made one for her putting a lot of work into it and it turned out very nice. She initially declined my offer to give it to her in early 2017, but I kept it and as time progressed to this summer her first real communication back to me was asking if I still had her stick. I told her I did and offered to send it to her. She now has it and even just sent me a picture of her with it while on a hiking trip. We do have a long ways to go yet, but are making real progress. I do think that she is finally seeing that I am not the horrible person that her mother made me out to be. Certainly I am not perfect and could have been a much better father, but I'm not the ogre that my ex wife imagined. My daughter may even be coming to spend some time with me for Christmas. I'm going to Vermont with my brother and family the week before Christmas and my daughter may get to join us. All because of a four foot piece of sassafras that had a vine growing around it. Along with several hours of whittling, a fair amount of sanding and nine coats of linseed and varnish. My daughter is my only child and means the world to me. Since we have started communicating again I have found out the she is actually carrying a double major in school (Psychology and Philosophy!) and will graduate in the spring and plans for a graduate degree in Psychology and probably a Phd after that. I am so very proud of her. We haven't yet discussed why she rather suddenly decided to get back in touch with me, but the time will come for that. I do know that her mother remarried this summer and that may have had something to do with it. For now I am thankful for getting to communicate with her and will take that as a very positive thing.",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0VKRD6A,
