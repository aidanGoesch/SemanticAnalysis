I was out and about, just doing a bit of shopping, when out of nowhere, i stumbled across someone who looked familiar to me. Upon further observation, I then noticed that it was a old friend of mine. It was hard to believe that i would cross paths with them out of the blue like this. I hadn't seen them in person since our time together at work. They had moved out of town to take a job in a different city but we still tied to keep contact over social media. Eventually we ended up losing touch with each other and so I hadn't heard from them in quite some time. We were quite excited to see bump into each other and immediately embraced. It felt super awesome to be able to talk to Bobby after so long a time. We talked a bit and got caught up on what had been happening in our lives up to this point. He mentioned that he was visiting his parents and that they happened to be out that day, just hanging out and such. It was a nice day to out indeed and seeing my friend made it that much better. After we talked a bit more, we decided to have lunch together the following day. It was great to hear a bit more in-depth about some of the various experiences that had taken place over the course of time that had transpired. I really felt refreshed and invigorated after spending time with my buddy.",37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5032BIC,
