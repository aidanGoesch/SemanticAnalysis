I got fired from my job at the meat department four months ago for stealing. While I do understand why I was fired for this act, I really do wish that the store would have given me a second chance back then or even a second chance right now. I was going through some hard times, and I really needed the extra food but could not seem to find it in my budget to make the purpose. I was rolling with a different crowd back then, and my lifestyle was not all that great. I have made some great strides over time though, and I feel that I have become a much better person. If only I was were this kind of person that day four months ago when I made the decision to steal. I have since distanced myself from the friends that led me into that situation, and have started to try to reconnect with old friends who may have a better influence on my life. I think so far they like me. They like me for who I am and not what I have, and they don't try to convince me to do anything out of my comfort zone. They are helping me realize that it is better to live a moral life, and it's actually not all that hard to do so. One of my friends, John, is even helping me prepare my resume and a cover letter to go back to the store with, and presenting my case to my old boss on why I should be re-hired for the job. I was a good butcher, and they know that. If they give me a second chance I will be able to show them the great man I have become, and their department will be better off with me back in that position. I'm really hoping this will go well. Tomorrow is the big day for my interview. Here goes nothing!",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5RFIBI7
