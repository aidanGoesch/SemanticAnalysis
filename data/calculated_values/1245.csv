It was okay, I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers. I was the only woman in the meat department. I'm a pretty crude person though lol so I got along fine with the guys. I was probably the dirtiest person there. We had to work in a very cold room, about 40 degrees, which made my toes and hands go numb a lot. The meat department is in the back of the store. It's in receiving, where the trash chute and compactor are. I got to see every day just how much waste a single Sam's Club generates. Our store threw away countless pounds of expired meat and other food. I saw other departments throw away perfectly good non-perishable goods, like clothing, because corporate decided that they weren't going to sell those items anymore, or the item was returned in an open package. It's cheaper for retail stores to throw those items away than to try to donate them.  The store wasted so much already. It didn't matter if I stole some meat. Most of what I stole was meat that was going to expire soon anyway, because that was easier to get away with. I got paid a crappy retail wage, so I made up for it by stealing some meat for myself and for my boyfriend to eat. I couldn't afford steak on my hourly rate. And yeah, one day I got caught. I'm really, really lucky that my supervisor didn't get the police involved, they just fired me. I'm very grateful for that. I was younger and made stupid choices. I still felt like shit about it, and I was really ashamed.",37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5RFIBI7,
