I worked at a meat department in a big warehouse type store, and I had stolen a LOT of meat. I would hide steaks under cheaper cuts of meat and buy them. I would underweigh things and print off their labels and steal things that way. I got caught for something relatively minor, and management didn't know the extent of my theft. This happened about 4 months ago, and I've matured since then. I felt like a fucking idiot for getting caught. I was deeply ashamed and embarrassed. I was extremely grateful that the police didn't get involved. I feel that I get lucky like that a lot in my life, and I don't deserve it.   My boyfriend was very disappointed in my for the theft. He told me a lot to stop doing it, but I guess I'm the kind of idiot that has to learn from their mistakes. While I was stealing from work I had also started shoplifting from stores. I never got caught for the shoplifting, but I haven't shoplifted since. I feel like I made my stupid, dumbass mistakes, and I'm eternally grateful that I didn't suffer any real consequences from them. I want to be a better person now.",37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5RFIBI7,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5RFIBI7
