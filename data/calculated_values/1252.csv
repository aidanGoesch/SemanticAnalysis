My husband, family and close friends were in my backyard with the scent or ribs rushing to my nostrils. Everyone shouted surprise, hugs and kisses came towards me one after the other. I had just graduated and recieved my masters degree in criminology. I did not recieve a party when I got my bachelors so I really was not expecting one now. My parents with tears of joy mentioned how long they have been planning the party and how hard it was to keep my husband from letting out the secret. My husband while laughing mentioned how it was the hardest thing to do because i am always being noisy. They prepared all my favorite foods; jerked chicken, ribs, curried mutton, hotdogs fries and cheesecake. They had the right playlist and decors is my favorite colors. In the center of the yard was a table with gift boxes and cards. I was overwhelmed and still in disbelief as i have never had something like this so much joy and pride in one place at the same time. Eveyone was talking and laughing, kids running around the yard.  I grabbed my plate and feasted upon the food the had prepared. I ate, drink and dance and the end of the night we played games and i opened my gifts. I received gift cards for my favorite restuarants, cash, jewelry and the greatest of all a new car from my husband, I could not hold back the tears as it burst from my eyes. This was definately one of the mostl memorable moments of my life.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5Z97IBZ
