We spent nearly the entire evening at the hospital by our house. Her first born, named Danielle, was delivered at 7:55pm. I am now finally a grandma! One of my greatest wishes finally came true! My daughter and her husband were so overcome with joy they couldn't stop the tears from flowing! It was a very emotional experience for them, as expected. We definitely went through a box of tissues or two! We are just so thrilled and proud of them both, and know they will be amazing parents for young Danielle. Yesterday was such a blur, despite the labor process only lasting a few hours. We are so excited to spend time with Danielle and watch her grow up. They will have a very enjoyable life living at their new home. I also suggested to my husband that we start a college fund right away. We will give them it as a gift for the holidays. Then we can add money to it each year on her birthday until she is 18.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5ZZMIBU
