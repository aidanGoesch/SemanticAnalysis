It was my school graduation ceremony. It was so memorable for me because my parent attended the ceremony. I attended the University of Los Angeles. I was the best graduating student of the medical college. I got 10 awards and i was so honored to share the moment with my parents. It was a day that felt like i was on top of the world. Memories of my first day in the college flooded in. I remember the sleepless night i had so as to study. All my dream came true that day. My siblings were also there to enjoy the experience. I'm a shinning light to the young people. Whatever you put your mind to will be a success. The only way to success is hard work. This moment has spurred me to go for more success. I have decided to give my all always.,,37KGEN7NJ4CLU6391JT5VT165AVPPM
