Mark and Alyssa were there, and even Rodney showed up for a little while. I hadn't seen Rodney in ages! There were a couple people there that I didn't know, but most of them were our friends from back in high school.  I remember Mike, Rodney and I used to get into so much trouble skipping class! Anyways, I had a great time celebrating with friends and seeing everyone. The dinner was tasty and Alyssa even brought some expensive Italian Cabernet for us to try. I think I still prefer a sweeter white zinfandel, but it was alright. After dinner (and dessert), we retired to the living room where we played some games together. Mark led us in an exercise writing poetry, and at the expense of my dignity I shared a couple of haikus that I wrote.  I thoroughly enjoyed the poetry. Our hostess then entertained us by bringing out the old VHS recording of their wedding and reception. Crazy to think that it has been 20 years already! Everyone looked so young in the video. Our lives have all gone off in different directions, what with Rodney moving to the big city and Alyssa traveling the world as a freelance writer and journalist. Even Mike moved away to the country to start a vineyard. It was great being able to catch up with everyone, and I hope we are able to get together like that more often.",,37KGEN7NJ4CLU6391JT5VT16E68PP0
