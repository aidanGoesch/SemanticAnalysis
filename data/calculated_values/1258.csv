I was asked to be part of the ceremony by writing and presenting 5 Haikus about their relationship.  When I got to the party, I was amazed at the number of old friends of mine that were also attending the event.  I knew at least 45 of the 50 or so attendees, although there were some folks I hadn't seen in years.   The party gave me an unexpeected chance to catch up with so many of these old friends.  It was so nice to see so many people I love and to get to celebrate one of my favorite couples with them all.  It also was very energizing to have so many friends together and it made me feel very happy and grateful I have so many amazing people in my life.  It's hard not to be happy when you realized you are so blessedThe ceremony itself was beautiful.  Both the bride and groom looked lovely and were happy and upbeat.  Everyone seemed to be in a great and appreciative mood and the ceremonywnet off without a hitch.  My haikus were well received, and people laughed and ""ahhhed"" at all the points I had hoped they would.  It made me feel very special that I was only 1 of 2 people who had been asked to contribute and speak at the ceremony, and I was grateful I got to contribute. After the ceremony, the food and reception were also fabulous.  I stayed at the party almost 4 hours before heading home.  Even then it was hard to leave because there were so many folks I wanted more time to catch up with.  I went home happy and energized by all the friendship and love from the night.",,37KGEN7NJ4CLU6391JT5VT16E68PP0
