We left our children with my parents and were gone for about 10 days including our two travel days. We had so much fun relaxing in the pool and by the beach. We also had the opportunity to indulge in drinks and food whenever we desired. We stayed at a Sandals resort in the Jamaican town of Ocho Rios. It was so incredibly gorgeous. I loved our view of the ocean from our balcony and the room was huge, clean, and beautiful. We had butler service while we were there and I really grew to love our butlers who I consider friends now. The first day of the vacation I drank a little bit too much while enjoying the pool. I decided to utilize my butler service to it's full extent so while drunk, I used the butler phone to call our butler on duty and asked for some snacks to be delivered to me at the pool. In just a short while, he pulled up in his golf cart and handed me a tray of cheese and crackers. They were so caring and kind and never seemed bothered by any of my silly requests. While we were there, we went zip lining which is something that we had been talking about doing our entire relationship so that was a really fun and special experience for us.  We even booked our return trip while we were still on resort! We are so excited to return that we have already started planning our daily activities while we're there.",37Q970SNZFUFQ60Z8YM9P2OJNTL1SR,
