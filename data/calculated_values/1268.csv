My husband and I took our first international trip together. Not only was it our first international trip together, it was also our first big trip without our two young children. We have done several small, weekend long trips but never for more than two days at the most. This time, we went to Jamaica and were gone for ten days. It was such an amazing experience. We had the opportunity to get to know each other better and become closer to each other. It has been four years since we had our oldest child. That is four years without real alone time to see who we are without being Mommy and Daddy. We got to just spend ten days in paradise having other people take care of us instead of us taking care of other people. We ate and drank and just had a great time being together. It made so much of an impact that our relationship is even stronger now than before. We have decided to book another trip to Jamaica for next year because we found the experience to just be so important and it made such a big impact on our lives. This was so surprising to me because we had to save up for quite awhile to take the trip in the first place. But with it being so good for our relationship, we decided we would find a way to be able to make it happen again in just one year.",37Q970SNZFUFQ60Z8YM9P2OJNTL1SR,37Q970SNZFUFQ60Z8YM9P2OJNTL1SR
