Woooooo!! I went to my very first baseball game today. I have always loved it watching baseball with day. I had always thought that it brought us closer together. It was something we cherished. As a loving tribute to dad, i went today. I was lucky enough to get a seat close to the field. It was a great game. But even more importantly, i caught a foul ball! Yes!!! I was so lucky, i can't even believe it. I know how lucky one should be to catch a ball in their first game. But i did! I got to keep the ball. I have always heard from dad that he always wanted to catch one. I went to dad's tombstone and placed it there. It is my final gift to him. Love you dad!",,37QW5D2ZRH8X16KK7JVO4CBRTQN8SO
