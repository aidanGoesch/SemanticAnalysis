Have a goal, achieve it, but decide something else is more important. It was a baseball game around the beginning of the season. And if you're an adult male that's loved sports their whole life, one of the bucket list items is to catch a foul ball at a game. I still remember this moment months later, and how it felt. The headline was man catches foul ball, which probably happens dozens of times each baseball game, but the better story is how I made a friend after catching it. I remember it being late in the game, and a ball was lofted in my direction. The stands were nearly empty so I figured I had a shot at it. It was going to land short. It bounced way short actually, hit a railing and deflected into my chest. Unfortunately I was still holding my beer at this point, so it caused it to soak my entire shirt, but who cares?! I grabbed the ball, but after I had it a minute, it didn't feel as special as I thought it would be. So I found a little kid I had been watching nearby for much of the game, and gave it to him. He was so happy he hugged me. His parents appreciated that as well, and we wound out talking the rest of the game (it was a boring game) about life, philosophy, just a regular nice conversation that matters that we tend to overlook in life. And that's the part I remember. The connection I made with someone else. The foul ball probably sits somewhere in his room, and I bet he remembers that moment too.",37QW5D2ZRH8X16KK7JVO4CBRTQN8SO,
