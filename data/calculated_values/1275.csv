Especially when you've been a sports fan your whole life, and a baseball fan, it means something. I have been going to baseball games for a long time. I used to bring my glove in hopes I would catch a foul ball, but once I got to a certain age, adulthood, I gave up. But still wanted to catch one, just to say I did. I went to a game with friends, it was pretty empty in the stands, but it was a nice day for a ballgame. Somewhere in the sixth or seventh inning, after I had gotten a beer, a player lofted a high foul ball that made me jump up because it was close to me. I ran over a few steps with the beer still in my hand but the ball was going to come up short. But then it bounced off the concrete, off a railing, and right into my chest. It dropped to the ground and I quickly grabbed it. Unfortunately I did not mention as it hit me, it caused my beer to spill all over my shirt, practically soaking it. But I had the foul ball. But once I had it in my hand, I realized it wasn't that important. So I found a kid with a glove and handed it to him, and he was so happy. I spent the rest of the game talking with him and his family. I felt like I made a new friend. So the price of a beer, a smelled soaked shirt, I learned a life lesson. It's not always what you catch, it's what you do with it that makes a difference.",37QW5D2ZRH8X16KK7JVO4CBRTQN8SO,37QW5D2ZRH8X16KK7JVO4CBRTQN8SO
