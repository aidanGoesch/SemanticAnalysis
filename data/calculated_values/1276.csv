All my life I have loved to paint and draw. As I grew in my art, I started using different, non-traditional materials to make art. Paint and canvases are very expensive, so I started looking around for things that were going to waste that could be made into beautiful works of art. I started using fabric because my grandmother had so much of it. She liked to quilt and make clothes. I remember her constantly sewing something. When she died there was so much fabric stored in her house. My mother and aunts were going to toss it out, but I rescued it. Material that I found included all types of prints and solids, and even some flour sacks that were used to make dresses in the 30s and 40s. I took it all. I washed and ironed everything that I planned to use. I decided that I wanted to use the fabric to make a collage that honored my grandmother. I picked a strong burlap for my base, then I drew in a portrait of my grandmother from a picture I had. I thought about skin tones and hair and eye color. Then I matched the fabric to my grandmother's face. The cutting and sewing took me weeks, but eventually I had a fabric portrait of my grandmother made from all the fabric she had at the end of her life.  It's hanging in my living room now. I've had plenty of offers to buy the piece, but I loved my grandmother and the portrait has so much of her personality, I don't want to part with it. I still have lots of fabric left over, but I'm not sure what I'll make next. I will be thinking about it for sure.",,37TD41K0AIVZD9AXOVBT6Y7AQINSC2
