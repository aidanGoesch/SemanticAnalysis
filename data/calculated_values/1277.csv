I make quilts and will be incorporating this new medium into it. I watched a couple of videos on how to do it and it looks like a lot of fun. I love quilting and sewing for myself and upping may game will be fun. I recently quit going to a quilting group and have found that my creativity on my own has really increased. I am finding more to do. It's amazing that not going to a group will expand your horizons. Atleast it has for me. I have recently been doing alot of sewing on my own and loving it. Changing the way clothes look. Altering clothes and trying different things with fabric. The different ways to use fabric has been a real challange to me and one I relish. It's fun coming up with art that is differnt from something someone else will do. Too many times we get stuck in a rut. Going out on your own is fun and wonderful.,,37TD41K0AIVZD9AXOVBT6Y7AQINSC2
