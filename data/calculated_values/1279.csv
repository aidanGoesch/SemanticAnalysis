This dates back to the early 2000s when I first became a fan of theirs. I missed a lot of their tours leading up to when they released their sixth album. They decided to do what would be a 20th Anniversary tour of their debut album. My brother-in-law had decided to purchase tickets for the both of us and I was stoked. They toured fairly close and it was a great opportunity to get pit tickets. What was really exciting was the fact that this was my first metal show ever. It was a long time coming and I was also interested in the opening bands that would be touring with Slipknot. The tickets were purchased a few months ahead of time at a sale price and that was awesome. We traveled a couple of hours to the arena where the concert was at and got to hang out with some interesting people before the show began. I was pumped up to finally enjoy Slipknot's music live. Behemoth opened the show with darkness and a lot of bass to their heavy style of music. It was the first time I had ever been in a pit and it was cool to bump around and just let loose with other people. Gojira played after that with their progressive style that really rocked. Volbeat played third and were soft compared to the other bands, but they got my hyped up. And then the Slipknot curtain was being set up as we were taking a bathroom break. We come back and get positioned on the floor near the pit again. It was extremely exciting and I had goosebumps as the intro to one of their earlier albums started playing. The curtain dropped and they started playing an older track which was raw and brutal. I was jumping and screaming the whole time while my brother-in-law lost his voice singing some of our favorite tunes we always jammed to. I don't remember the last time a concert really got my pumped up, but this one sure did the job well. Slipknot's new music they played live was incredible and some of the songs off the new album sounded super good live. It was probably the best show I had been to and I really got a shot of energy from experiencing it. We both walked out of there fulfilled by what just happened and it was definitely worth the long wait to see Slipknot as well as the other bands that joined them on tour.",37TD41K0AIVZD9AXOVBT6Y7ARN4SCU,
