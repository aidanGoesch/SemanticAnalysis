For many years, she was the babysitter to myself and my siblings. She would make us warm tea, tell us stories of when she was a young child, and share her words of wisdom about many things. Life made sense because of her. I knew she was getting old, but I refused to believe that she would ever leave this Earth. She has been my inspiration and my rock as a pillar of wisdom as I grew into the young professional I am today. However, she passed away three months ago. She died peacefully in her sleep overnight. Unfortunately the costs of her death and burial was substantive. My father started working two jobs. My mother took up another job herself. Saying this event was emotionally and financially stressful may be an understatement. Though we were there for one another, we all wanted space to ourselves as we grieved over her. Therefore, I had an idea. I looked online for resources available to assist grieving families. To my chagrin, I found that there aren't many resources dedicated to this phenomenon. This is depressing, but we will fight, and we will overcome and remember grandma in our hearts.",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E68JBQ
