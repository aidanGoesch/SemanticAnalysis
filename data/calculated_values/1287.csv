The mountain is named Cascade.  Growing up in Long Island my parents were not particularly active. We never went biking or hiking or did any outside activities. Now at 55+ I have begun to be more active. I have a cousin who is an avid hiker. As such we met up in the Adirondacks at Cascade mountain. We parked the car and hiked up the mountain. It took a few hours to get to  the top. I was not actually sure if I could  do the hike since I never did one before that high. It was beautiful. We stayed awhile and ate. Then it took a few hours to hike down.  The hike down was actually harder to do. I live in Albany New York so 8t is only a few hours drive to the mountain from home.,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7AJBV,
