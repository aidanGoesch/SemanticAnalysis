I grew up in Long Island. My parents were not particularly active. We never went biking or hiking or took any type of trip that involved physical activity. In June 2019 I decided for the first time to go hiking. I had been going to the gym in my apartment for quite a number of months walking up to three miles each morning. I decided to hike one of the high peaks in the Adirondacks mountains in New York. It is called Cascade mountain. It is approximately 5000 feet high. I got up at 6 a.m. in the morning I drove from my home in Albany New York to the entrance to the trail. The trip is about 4 hours. I began the height and followed the various trail markers to The summit. Along the way I met quite a lot of people. most were younger than me but there were a few by age. Everyone was extremely friendly. It was a beautiful sunny day. I took the hike slow since it's a steady incline to The summit. I reach the summit after approximately two hours. It was beautiful. There was no commercial property anywhere to be seen. They were other mountains trees and forests all around. I spent about an hour at the summit eating lunch. I then hike back down. I then return to my home. All in all it was an amazing experience,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7AJBV,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7AJBV
