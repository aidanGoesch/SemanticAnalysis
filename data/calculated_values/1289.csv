It all started from Oliver, my cat. He was with me for seven years already. I already consider him as family. Recently, I married my girlfriend, Shirley. Before marrying, we've been together for five years but spent most of the time away from each other because of work. So, Shirley doesn't get to hang around Oliver as much. As we got to live in the same house, I decided to take Oliver with me. Shirley said she is okay with it, although she did not grew up around animals and pets unlike me. Anyway, a few day in and she always complain about feeling itching sensation around her body and she kept on sneezing. I thought it's just the dusts from the house. Unfortunately, it was because of Oliver. We both didn't know she had allergies with cats. Bottom line, I had to find a new home for Oliver. I spent so many hours today looking for a good home for Oliver. It was very emotional for me. Oliver is family but I need to put my wife's health a priority. My wife helped me, of course. At the last minute, my wife suggested if maybe we can give it to my parents. Why did I not even think about it? So we called my mom and she said she would love to have Oliver. Problem solved!",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7BJBW
