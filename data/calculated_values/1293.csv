The bed I sat on was on the left wall. The door was behind me on the right. The paining in front of me had a small boat, 3 birds, a river, and rainbow buildings. There were 3 of those boxes on the wall that contain like shots or something, next to me. I cried for about 10 minutes straight. The doctor’s stethoscope was blue, I think. Yet I don’t even recall what day of the month this was. Every time I read this certain book, I remember vividly reading the exact same book in 5th grade, at a plastic fold out table, with a purple reading light, waiting on my mother who was helping my aunt set up her wedding reception stuff at the time. I remember exactly what passage I was reading at the time, and remember what cuss word was said in that chapter. I remember how I set up my assorted stuff on top of my dresser in my old room, but don’t even remember the color of the walls. i remember outfits that my best friend would wear, in 6th grade, down to the texture that it looked like and color of the fabrics, and individual pieces of clothingthe entire layout of my grandparent’s house in Hong Kong, even though i haven’t been there since I was 6 and haven’t seen pictures of it sincei remember, at some time when I was really young, I was tired and crying. I think something was wrong with me because I was freaking out. I remember vividly my hallucinations (a wrecking ball in my room) and it’s really hard to describe, but the world felt out of proportion and for some reasons, small objects like my glass of water felt so much larger in my hand. I picked up an ottoman and a cup to prove myself, but probably ended up looking even more crazy. I only remember the names of 3 nurses that I had while I was in the hospital, even though I had about 13 of them. (Alan, Francesca, and Wes. Alan was hilarious, Francesca was pretty and nice, and Wes was kind)",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F8XJBK
