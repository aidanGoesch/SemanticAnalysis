It was quite surprising to see how responsive and helpful my second oldest relative at my Unk's old house was.  We were able to get a lot done while I was there over one weekend day.  I thought that it was fulfilling to get things done for other people that didn't directly benefit me. It also helped me to think outside the box to get things done.  Sometimes we need to volunteer and challenge ourselves.  The neighbors who live close by my Unk's old house were very nice with the waving that they did.  It was a pleasant surprise to be waved to, even though the townspeople did not know me personally. It was not something I am aware of happening in my big city where people tend to keep to themselves.  My city is much colder in terms of personality and people keep their head's down.  I sensed that over the six weeks that I visited my Unk's old house, the townspeople waved a little less.  I noticed that over the last two weekends, people stopped paying much attention to the heavy yard work that was being taken care of.  My Unk's old house started to look much more presentable in the town.  It had been neglected over eight years.  I took it upon myself to clean my Unk's house. My uncle and his wife would have appreciated my hard work.",37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F9KBJ1,
