While there was no one to do this work, I took it upon myself to do the weeks and weeks of hard work for no pay.   I think that doing good works for people without really asking for anything in return us honorable.  My cousin told me that he got a price quote for 1,000 dollars to do all the work.  My cousin had been sick a long time and inherited his father's house when he died.  My cousin has inherited a lot of wealth, but is in bad health himself, which is not a good thing.  In my opinion, money cannot buy mental health or sanity.  Moreover, it can be more of a burden, inheriting thousands and thousands of dollars. I spent so many weekends in the heat of the summer, doing laborious yard work over six weekends, that I lost 5 pounds. I spent my 15 minutes breaks, drinking Powerade and water during the eighth or nine hours per day that I cut down all the overgrown hedges and weeds around my Uncle's house. I also trimmed around the shed and elsewhere on my Uncle's property.  It was all work and no play at my Uncle's old house.  I did like the views in their town.  The sky was open and there were plenty of views of the mountains.  I guess that was an upside to doing the work.  You did get the fresh air of the mountains. Over the six weekends that I was tidying up the yard out front and around back, the neighbors were pleasantly surprised that work was getting done.  The one neighbor of my Uncle was on his riding tractor, cutting his lawn like everyone in my Uncle's small town tend to do.  In fact, they were watching as I took some time, cutting all the large branches and large plants that were growing near the edge of the neighbor's property.  The neighbors in town don't miss a thing.  It is a town with very little crime from the statistics that I checked out.  My Uncle's town was very safe, since everyone knows each other's name. These weeds had been overgrown for a decade, but it got the neighbor's attention -- in a good way.  The fact that things were getting done on the property and that I have a ""big heart"" and that ""God"" will ""bless me"" for doing this work was a touching moment for me.  My Uncle and Aunt would really have appreciated the hard I put in on the property, since many neighbors did.",37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F9KBJ1,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F9KBJ1
