I got over not graduating college. I felt great about it. I told my friends and family. Some were supportive. Others were mad. I realized that it's a waste of money for most people. You'll never payback the loans in this economy unless you get a high paying field that is in demand. I felt smart about not graduating college because of the loans. It would be a waste of time and a waste of money. Most people will be serving coffee, while trying to pay the loan back. I will get a trade instead. This will be better for me than going to college. I will work hard and make more money. I will start an apprenticeship next week.",,37U1UTWH9W8L0RK7SUVJE26V7M3R8E
