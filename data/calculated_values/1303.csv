The day that we got engaged, it was around Christmas and he popped the question in front of my whole family. To say that it was something special was an understatement! He had asked my mom and dad for permission and when I opened my gift from him it was a ring and I looked at him and he was already on one knee! Planning the wedding was just as easy as my decision to marry him! He just wanted me happy and to have anything that I wanted. Both of our parents helped pay for things and that lifted a huge burden off of us. His sister helped with a lot of the planning since she was a professional wedding planner until she had children and stopped doing that. She helped pick out this wonderful natural location in the woods of a park that me and him met and went on frequent walks at. The location was so special to us! She picked out a wonderful live band and said that it would be so much better than having a DJ playing, and it was! The music was so good and it wasn't a typical crappy wedding band. This band was LEGIT! Another thing that really shocked me was how little the food cost but how much of it we had gotten! There was food for a month for everyone and it didn't cost an arm and a leg! The whole day was wonderful and really being married to the man of my dreams, surrounded by friends and family... the day couldn't have gotten better!",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN1NJ1RC
