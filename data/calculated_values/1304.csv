We were married on a beautiful day surrounded by the love and happiness from our close family and friends. We had a small wedding. It was something that was very easy to plan from the start. No Frills wedding. We arrived and everything just fell into place. We had a live wedding singer who performed at our ceremony. We completed pictures and went into our first dance. Everyone cheered and I cried because you could just feel the love and the room. My 80 year old dad and I dance with each other and it was a very special moment! We sat and that is when the toasts began! We had such a great time listening to everyone recount our love. The evening went fast which was bitter sweet. I did not want it to end. We danced, laughed and had a wonderful time. We drank and partied the night away.",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN1NJ1RC
