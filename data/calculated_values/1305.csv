The kids left home a few months ago and our nest is empty. The days seem to drag on, Carl didn't seem to have much purpose anymore. Then the neighbor girl Samantha asked us if wed like to adopt a cat a few days ago. I didn't think it was the best idea at first, but Carl wanted to. He made up a bed for her and got all of the supplies we needed. Hes so loving and caring. It reminds me of why I married him and the family we built together. Its hard to still feel like a family these days but I think we'll be okay now. We named the cat Turk. She lays next to him while he watches TV. I've never seem a cat follow a man around so much. Shes also laid in bed with me while I read. Shes brought so much comfort into our home. It feels like a home again.",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7
