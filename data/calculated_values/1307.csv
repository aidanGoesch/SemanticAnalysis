I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: ""Get that gum ball, Archie."" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years. Thank you, Archie. You deserve all the gumballs. Me and CatDad love you a lot.",37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7
