A guy parked his car in a disabled spot and got out to go in to the store.  At the same time a lady pulled up next to him and shouted to him out of the car window.  At the time I couldn't really see what was going on but I figured it out myself.  The guy had parked in a disabled spot and not displayed a tag.  The lady was disabled and was asking him to do so as she needed the spot.  The guy ran in to the store and the woman waited for him.  By the time he came out she was, understandably irate.  He just lost it and started calling her all sorts of horrible names which related to her being unable to walk.  It was just unreal to see such anger and hate in the world.  I decided at that point had to intervene.  I got out of my car and walked over toward where they were arguing.  I sided with the lady, of course.  I couldn't keep my emotions in check though! I just screamed at the man until I was blue in the face.  Some people just need to be told.",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJNC611R7
