He was in town for a little bit in a few weeks and had bought tickets to a baseball game in my city. So we made sure I could make it and planned to meet at the park. The week leading up to the game was very rainy and I was getting worried that it might rain out the game. In which case my dad may be unable to make the makeup game. So I kept a close eye on the weather forecast for the day we were to go. Unfortunately it looked like rain and there ended up being a major storm in the morning. Lots of rain and really no sign of it breaking up, until around mid-day where all of a sudden it went away. So we met up and it was actually very nice weather by the time we arrived at the park. There were a lot of people there even with the threat of rain. We had dinner at the park before the game and sat down to watch the game. The people who sat around us were all nice and we had conversations about the game. The game went long and it was an exciting one with lots of action. Unfortunately our team ended up losing in a heartbreaking fashion in the last inning. After the game it took a while to leave the stadium and even longer to get out of the parking ramp I was in. All in all it was great time and everything worked out.",37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6,37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6
