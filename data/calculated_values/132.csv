We went on trip to South Florida to take advantage of the warm southern whether, since, you know, winter in the north is a pain. We tried to take my van but the blasted thing wouldn't start so that was out. We asked my Dad if we could take his truck but he needed it for work so that was out. We then remembered that my Mom had left her car while she was in Europe for the winter and I called her up. She told us not to take her car but we were out of options so we did anyway. We got about halfway to Florida before the clunker broke down! We were stuck on the side of the road for hours waiting for a tow truck to get there which wasn't fun. Even less fun was thinking we'd lost our puppy! In all the chaos we'd lost track of her and I was so sure she'd gotten out on the highway, but thankfully we were able to find her in the backseat later. She'd burrowed under a blanket and taken a nap, the silly thing! When the tow truck finally got there they towed us home. We were able to fix Mom's car before she got back from her trip so she never knew what had happened. She even commented about how it ran better now than when she'd left! I don't think we'll ever tell her what went wrong that week, but at least all's well that ends well.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMRJOASD
