Do you remember about a year ago, when I told you about my lifelong dream to be a professional weightlifter? I started to do what I could to make this dream a reality. I ate healthy, protein rich foods. I took supplements. I started lifting in steady, gradually increasing increments. Alas, I believe that this life revelation came too late. I fear now that I'll never become a professional weightlifter. I'm starting to recognize the limits of my own body. I tore a muscle while attempting a particularly challenging curl. I know now that my body is past its prime. From here on, my health will only be getting worse. My body will keep aging, and become even more susceptible to injury than before. I need to move on. I want to stay in good shape, but I'll have to simply do it for my health now.",,37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3R5R7VL
