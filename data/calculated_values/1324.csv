As I approached the peephole, I could see similar features of that of my brother. My brother had been out of touch and out of town for far to long. As he entered our childhood home, everyone there lined up for hugs. They each also got on their phones inviting others to come and witness what their eyes was glad to see. I was surprise and happy as were everyone who was present to greet my brother. My brother start to discuss his journey and why he was here. I could gather that he was homesick and was not about to miss another holiday without celebrating with his family. Young and old, I could see smiling faces and positive interactions. As the day came to a close, I was pulled aside by my brother to learn his health scare. I was sworn into secrecy. I knew there was another reason behind his visit as the holidays though approaching were still several weeks away. I was happy that he did want to be with his family at this time of sadness. I want to know more. I want to know if he had a chance to beat this disease.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2E2C0YWJ
