My mother told me not to take her car as it wasn't ready for the road we didn't listen. Me and my boyfriend and my two brothers were all stuffed in this sedan with our new puppy. We made our way down the highway about 40 miles (It was a 180 mile trip) when my boyfriend points out the heat gauge is going up. Shortly after that the car begins to stall. This is where everything takes a turn. We pull off to the side of the highway in order to check the car. It turns out to be a radiator problem and with no towns for 20 miles in any direction were in trouble. So we are all sitting in the car trying to avoid the heat when we notice ""has anyone see the puppy?"". This is when things get even worse we couldn't find our puppy we thought she might of ran off into the everglades to the right of us so we start going in the mud looking around. We called her name shaked a box of treats and still can't find her. Then my brother in the car calls us all over and low and behold there's the puppy. She was hiding in between the seats and the trunk to stay cool and somehow she found her way in a spot where none of us could see her! This brings up our moral while we wait for triple a that my grandma had called for us. In the end we never did get to go on that trip with the puppy but we all made it out okay and for what it was it's a memorable little road trip for us.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMRJOASD
