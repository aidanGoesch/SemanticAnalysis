A beautiful state convenient to the east coast beaches as well as the cities of New York and Boston.  The fall foliage is amazing. There are so many quaint towns to visit, many with historical significance.  The state parks are wonderful to visit, many with beautiful rivers and lakes. These are some of the positives but there are also many negatives.  Including extremely high taxes, outrageous home prices, cold winters and abundance of people I like to call uptight. Wanting a change of scenery and financial status I decided in June of this year to relocate to North Carolina.  The weather is fantastic, taxes are low and the overall cost of living is much cheaper.  It was the best decision of my life, I absolutely love it here! There are beautiful beaches, lots of activities and the people are so down to earth. The packing was hard work and very emotionally taxing.  It's not easy to change your entire life.  The move was also and continues to be a financial hardship but things are getting better. It has been 4 months and I wouldn't change a thing.  I have a job, I am saving money and enjoying my life.  I do miss my friends and family members but they are all welcomed to visit.  I am close to Myrtle Beach and would love to take them to see some of the attractions.  I'm sure they would enjoy it here as much as I do.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EBB6WYU
