I was in a relationship at that point and could tell he had a bit of a crush on me so I ignored him. He asked me to hang out multiple times that year, and I never did. My boyfriend and I ended up breaking up and I turned to my current boyfriend. We started hanging out and became best friends. He came to visit me over winter break my sophomore year. We ended up having a great time and i felt confused. I was scared I would ruin our friendship. Our relationship became more flirtatious and I knew I had to make a move. One day I randomly kissed him. Shortly after we went on our first date and have been together almost 2 years now. We're seniors in college and plan to move in together after graduation. We are still best friends, but so much more. As scary as it was, I made the right decision. I'm so much happier for it.",37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EZU0YWG,
