The fight was over my girlfriend. That ho was messing around with some of the men at the bar. We had all been drinking. We were drinking perhaps too much. The police were called out. Luckily, they decided not to arrest any of us. Once they saw how much of a ho my girlfriend is, they let us all go. They had us sober up down at the drunk tank. Lucky for us, these guys were cool. After we sobered up, me and the guys I was fighting with became buddies. The moral of that story is to not get drunk. Drinking leads to bad times. Especially when there is a ho involved. And my girlfriend is the biggest ho you'll ever see.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMS6ZSAH
