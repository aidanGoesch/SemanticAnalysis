My mom has always loved animals and always dreamed of having a mini farm on her property. As expected my mom bought about 10 chickens and build them in amazing chicken coop. So one day me being excited to go and check out her form I went over to where the chickens were. Without second-guessing I went into the chicken coop to take a closer look at the chickens. But unfortunately I did not look at my surroundings very well before entering because when I saw next remember screaming and yelling as loud as I could but to no avail nobody ever heard of it. I had to sit there and tear and watch at this big snakes were lurking at me trying to make a move. I honestly didn't know what to do. Thankfully when I saw one of the snakes going around the tube to try to get one of the chickens I made my escape. Unfortunately I did not go and will paralyze me forever. At the corner of the only exit of the chicken coop for two big rattlesnake hissing and looking. I remember that I thought my face drain from heat. I remember screaming and yelling as loud as I could but to no avail nobody ever heard of it. I had to sit there and tear and watch at this big snakes were lurking at me trying to make a move. I honestly didn't know what to do. Thankfully when I saw one of the snakes going around the tube to try to get one of the chickens I made my escape. Unfortunately I did not go unhurt. My leg split open From the barbed wire that my mom had sitting out front. Needless to say this will be an experience that I will never forget.,,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E4GORCX
