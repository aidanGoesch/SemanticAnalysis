For two nights, I stayed at my brother with him, his newborn, his wife, and our father. We spent the days exploring the city, eating, and drinking. It was a wonderful visit. I don't seem my brother often since his move to Florida. This had been the first time I'd seen him in about 9 months. I'll be visiting again next month. After the two nights there, I drove with my dad down to his home in Lake Worth. We ate and drank. We went into the city and explored some as well. It was a good time. I met his new girlfriend, who was very nice. She was quite educated. She hailed from New York. She worked in publishing.",37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E5KXRCF,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E5KXRCF
