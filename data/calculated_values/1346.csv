My friend Daniel and I met when I was 18, and we had a lot in common. Over the span of 7 years a lot of intimate and fun memories were made together. We both attended college, worked, and spent many hours over the weekends hanging out. As we both grew older over the span of our friendship, we started to drift apart. Daniel was accepted for a job across the states, and I was in the midst of nursing school. We both were finding it difficult to maintain a friendship, and see each other between our busy schedules. Both of us were succumbed into our work and school, and had minimal time outside to make plans to see one another. Daniel was hoping that eventually he would be returning here to the south after he completed his job training, but his approval for transfer was never accepted. Three months ago my life changed. I grew tired of the distance, as did Daniel. The lack of communication, and vastly different work schedules began tearing our friendship apart. Three months ago, Daniel and I made time finally to sit down in person over lunch and discuss our friendship.  The discussion did not go well, and we both felt exhausted trying to maintain a long distance friendship any further. I wanted so badly to come up with a reason to continue the friendship, but I was tired of putting energy into a practically non-existent friendship anymore. Daniel and I agreed over our lunch that day to walk separate ways. The lunch ended with me in tears, knowing my best friend wouldn't be my best friend anymore. Truth is, I still love him and wish him well, but I know it is time to move forward in my life.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E5NQRCE
