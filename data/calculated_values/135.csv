Once we decided on a place we chose a bar. This was a fun place for the night . There were a lot of men there and my girlfriend is cute. She looks really good.  We had a few drinks and the music was loud. The atmosphere was good. I had to go to the bathroom at one point. When I came back from the bathroom I see two guys talking to my girlfriend and flirting with her. I approach the, and tell them to leave as she is there with me. They were drunk and didn’t listen. We got into an argument and eventually a fight. The police arrived shortly after to break the fight up. It was a bad night over a stud pod argument. That is how I learned not to mix and drink too much in public. That is the story I want to portray. Don’t drink too much!",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMS6ZSAH
