This trip with my daughter from the South to the West of the United States was a wonderful and memorable journey.  This trip was exciting because I had never ridden a train before.  I felt as if I was participating in an adventurous Harry Potter side-story (I am chuckling to myself). My daughter and I took a trip to visit my sister and her husband at around the end of May, 2019.  My daughter and I started our trip off on a bus. The interaction between the middle-aged bus driver and a young male passenger, who sat opposite of but directly behind her, had me !cracking up with laughter!  because the young male passenger kept blurting obscenities during his telephone conversation and the bus driver kept interrupting him with dialogue that was firm, but a polite reminder to the passenger that he is choice of words were not appropriate for her ears.  As the hours got later, the bus driver started to swerve a little.  She was obviously tired.  To keep herself awake, she would hum to herself.  Her humming got progressively louder and louder.  Because my daughter was tired from the not sleeping well the night before our trip, she had become very annoyed with the bus driver's humming and swerving.  My daughter assumed that she would be able to get a good nap during the trip.  All of the antics going on during the trip didn't stop me from taking a nap. My daughter and I finally stopped for our transfer from bus to train in Indiana.  Our six hour lay over happened in the wee hours of the morning.  We finally boarded our train and had another lay over -- it only lasted half as long as the last -- in Chicago.  The bag check attendant was hilarious!  He teased my daughter about jumping inside of her suitcase and stowing away with us; my daughter's previous national and international travels would explain her huge suitcase.  The customer service attendant was amazing, delightful and sweet.  After checking in our bags, my daughter and I ate a good, hot lunch in the bus/train station's food court, and admired the architecture of the station.",37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E698RC5,
