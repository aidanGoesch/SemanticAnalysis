It's really hard to imagine how I will get over this, which is depressing. But I know I have to find a way to get past it. This is really affecting my relationships; reflecting back on the last few months I can see that it's really eroded my trust in people. I know it's not healthy, but it's so difficult to get over it! And seeing how Susie has pulled away has been a real shock; I realize it's been hard, but she is - was - my best friend. I tried calling her at Christmas time and when she hung up on me it was like a cold splash of water to my face. I was hoping that it'd be different once the new year started. New year, new beginnings, that kind of thing. I made this a specific resolution, as I've always been good with those as an incentive. But it really hasn't changed, and that makes me so upset. I have to stop worrying so much; I think that's really exacerbating my problems with trusting people, but it's also really tiring and exhausting. If I wasn't constantly thinking about the accident, maybe I'd be able to stop worrying so much. At least, I think I would. The other big impact is how much my confidence has been destroyed. I don't know that I was really over confident before the accident, but I did have some respect for myself, and that's gone now, too. It's sad. It's really amazing how much that accident has taken over my whole life; it's had such a negative impact on my quality of life overall, and my state of mind has taken a huge turn for the worse. I have to stop wallowing in self-pity and get past this; it's up to me to make my life better.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EG4XRCU
