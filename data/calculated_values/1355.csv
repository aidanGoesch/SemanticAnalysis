I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come.      The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.     Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place.     I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot money for many years. The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. This was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EG4XRCU
