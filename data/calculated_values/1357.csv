I have not been flying with him for the last 40 years, so I was curious to see why he had contacted me. I then met him at the airport and we talked a bit in the lounge and we then proceeded to go to the airplane and being the pre flight check. When we had completed this we got in the plane and he started it up. After some chatter with the control tower, we were cleared for a runway and we began to taxi. When we were all lined up the control tower gave us a clear for takeoff and he put the engines on max and we quickly gained speed and then the ground left us as we were up in the air. It was exhilarating. When we were up, I looked around at the familiar surroundings that were now not so familiar with the altitude and the new view. I looked all over and couldn't believe we were so high up in the air. He began talking and we made small talk for a while, but then he got into the story of the last 15 years and why he had basically just withdrawn into his own world with his sick daughter and his marriage that had been in shambles as a result of his daughter getting sick. We had a good time bonding and after being in the air for about 35 minutes he got a hold of the control tower again and we came in for a landing. Yes, it was an interesting day once again bonding with my uncle. And a surprising one at that too, as I had not been up in a private plane for a good 40 years. It was good to reconnect with my Uncle. I think that we should all be in touch with family members. It was a shame that we were out of touch because time moves too fast.",37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EXWRRCP,
