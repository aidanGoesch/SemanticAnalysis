Honestly, I've never really been much of an animal person at all. That all changed when my son decided that he really wanted a kitty. My ex and I get along, so she made sure to ask first if it was okay for her to get him a kitty. I have full custody, and she sees him every other weekend, so the cat would mostly be at my house. Unable to resist my son's charm, I said yes. She got him a little rag doll kitten, and my son was in love. He treated that cat with the utmost respect. He named the cat Percy after some kid's show I think. The cat was so snuggly and loving, that even I wound up falling in love with the cat. Now, all this time later, we have 3 cats, with Percy being the oldest. It took my son being cute, but he turned me into a cat lover. I love my cats to death. My son and I have bonded over loving our kitties. I will always love my son so much.",,30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A
