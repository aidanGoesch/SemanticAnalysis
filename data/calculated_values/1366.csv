For the most part, it really started when I moved to the neighborhood. I was cutting my grass on a really hot day and this little old woman walks over to me and hands me some fresh lemonade. I had really never seen much of this woman aside from her getting the main in the morning as I was leaving for work. A wave here and there. But upon giving me this lemonade, her and I struck up a conversation that lasted way longer than I had ever thought. We talked for hours about our past and even ended up knowing a lot of the same people which was super weird! From that moment her and I would sit on my patio after work and sometimes on the weekends and have drinks together. She would take care of my dogs when I would leave for vacations or traveling for work. She never asked for anything in return which was super nice. Over the years, I started doing more things for her as she got older. I would cut the grass for her. Trim the trees and bushes around her house. It eventually got the point where I would come home and bring in the mail from the end of the street for her since she struggled to get around. It was sad to see her advancing in age. A few years ago, her family moved her to a case facility so she could live in a place where she didnt need to worry about taking care of herself as much and would be there if she fell. We still hung out, but nearly as much as we had when she lived next door. Never losing touch of course, but just not as frequent as it had been in the past. I got a call a few months ago that she had passed and it really hit me hard. It was like losing a friend whom I'd known for a good portion of my life. I knew this day was coming, but its so tough to prepare yourself. You can prepare all you want, but when it finally happens, it really hit home. I know shes in a better place, but she will always have a special place in my heart.",,37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87E8YDTSU
