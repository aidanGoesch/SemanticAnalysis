I was on my way home from work when a large white truck hit me from the side at an intersection.  The truck ran a read light because they were falling asleep at the wheel. I never even saw the truck coming so i was surprised when I was struck. It was around 6:30 am when this happend so the roads were pretty empty at first. I remember hearing the crash but not really seeing it and then kind of just realizing i was hit. When i gathered myself i started to get out of the car and notice two people walking towards me asking if i was doing OK. It turns out one of the people that i was talking to was the person that hit me and they seemed very scared and apologetic. It took maybe about 10 minutes for the police to arrive and take our statements and make a report for us. My car had to be towed off the scene. I would later find out that it was a total loss. I was a little upset though to see there was little to no damage to the truck that hit me. lucky i wasn't to far from home so i ended up just walking the rest of the way there. On the way home i still felt a little shaken up and even almost nervous as if i was in trouble. The whole event was a bit scary to me since i had never been in a car accident before but i was just happy to be safe. I now own a truck for the safety features it has because my little car didn't  stand a chance. I now also notice that i drive slower through intersections without even thinking about it.,,37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87EF8TTS1
