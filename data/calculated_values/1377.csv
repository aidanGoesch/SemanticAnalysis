I had worked on trying to get in all of my last minute papers and exams for the finals. For which I still had one class. That I never turned in by the way, but the teacher left me off. I woke up at like 3:00 in the morning because I needed to wash my hair in order to put on my Wig that I had wanted to wear. It was an very expensive wig for 200.00 Dollars. I was super stressed on not being able to wear it. I managed to get the wig on, but I didn't have much time for anything else. So that meant: no makeup, no nothing. I barely had time for anything else.Then I picked the wrong shoes to wear. When I got to the stadium I could not even where the shoes that I had brought to wear. I could not get them on my feet, I was drained, not satisfied with how I looked, and felt like I was on the verge of having a mental breakdown. As usual, I quickly decided I was just going to block everything out and get through the day. I walked into the stadium and the floor was bare concrete. Not only did we had to walk across this bare concrete floor, but we also had to stand for the into that was almost 30 Minutes!!! And I was wearing shoes that had not type of support. Just my luck on all days of today. I had been imagining this event for the past five years. It was turning out to be one of the worst days of my life. All my planning and effort was equaling to this moment right here. Then after standing for 30 minutes, we were finally able to sit down. Being that my name started with a B, I was lucky to be one of the first ones called. But not so lucky that I had to wait for everyone else in the line to be called before the ceremony was over. When the ceremony near the end. There was a hilight moment where they  had this amazing confetti and Jazz band. But go figure I could not capture any of it because my phone was dead. So yeah when I got home",37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87EHXTTSH,
