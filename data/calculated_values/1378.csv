This moment was memorable because I was finally closing a chapter in my life that had took so much of my time. I remember getting ready that day. I woke up early because I wanted to do my hair and makeup. I wanted to have the time to make it perfect. But, I quickly realized not everything was going to turn out perfect when my hair would just not curl. The time was already to go and I didn't have my dress on or my makeup up done. As the clock zoomed by, I was in a crying fit as my mom rushed me into my dress and I walked to the car with no shoes on and no makeup. Already a day I had dreamed about, planned out so perfectly was already ruined. I knew it I could feel it deep in my gut. The icing on the cake was when I arrived to the arena in my four inch heels and realized the floor was completely concrete, and I would have to stand for hours one in. This day could not have turned out worse. I just wanted to go home and get my diploma in the mail. I realized this event was not for me. I wasn't doing if for me. I was just happy to graduate and wanted to take a nap after a long 18 credit semester. I was doing all this for my family. But this moment made me realize that moments you dream about don't always turn out as planned.",37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87EHXTTSH,37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87EHXTTSH
