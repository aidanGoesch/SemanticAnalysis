In order to successfully raise the money we needed we are formed dance groups. We put on a show to raise as much money as possible for the individuals in need in Haiti. I had a really great time participating in this event and made some great friends. I hope we continue to do this event as the people in Haiti are still in need. My friends and I all are big dancers and during the contest we danced to ice ice baby and won. There were a lot of people participating and it was great to see everyone contributing to a good cause. Even the adults were dancing and gave us a run for our money. The contest was judged by some members of the community and they had a great time doing it. No prizes were awarded but bragging rights came with our victory. I felt really great after to see that we had raised over $1000 to support the people in Haiti. We sent the money off the next day and are excited to hear back from the group receiving it. I know they will really appreciate it greatly. Their country is very in need of any support. I'm excited to continue on supporting other individuals in the future.,,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N
