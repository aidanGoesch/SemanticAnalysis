She was a gift for my seven year old son from his father, he cleared it with me first whether he could get the cat as we already have two.  I initially was going to say no, but then he told me that it was a Rag Doll kitty, and I had read a lot about how awesome that breed of cat is. The fact that it was a pure bred cat changed my mind as to whether we should get it.  My first two cats are rescues, from a kill shelter and from a vet's office, I told myself I had saved two already and I can give this one a good home too. I told him yes, then we had to almost a month for her to be ready to come to our house.  When my ex finally brought her over I had no idea how quickly I would fall in love with her.  She's the cutest, fluffiest, little kitty ever, and her personality is so easy to like.  She's sweet and cuddly, purrs as soon as you touch her or pick her up, and she looks so happy to be pet. She's also super playful, pick up a toy and she comes running and pounces on it, her favorite toys have feathers on them. She runs and jumps through the air so comically that you can't help but laugh at her antics.  She's made a huge impact in my home, the other two kitties have been very accepting of her, after the first day hissings.  I love my first two cats to pieces, but neither one of them is a lap kitty.  New kitty loves to curl up on my lap and be pet.  It makes me so happy to have a kitty that likes to snuggle and be close.  I'm very happy that I now have three cats in my home, so is my son, as he likes to say he's a crazy cat boy.",30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A,30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A
