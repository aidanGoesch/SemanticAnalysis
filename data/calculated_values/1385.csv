About 6 months ago I was in an dating app just trying to kill time. I was going trough a hard time in my life and I was very depressed. Suddenly, a person started talking to me, telling me that I look sad in my profile picture. After speaking for a while we decided to meet. I thought nothing of this meeting, I simply made of it as another one night stand, but when I saw the person. He was more good looking than the pictures, he had a killing smiling and a very cheery and bright personality. I was very nervous and I feared that he might not like me, or that I wasn't good enough for him. After meeting several times, our relationship has grown stronger and stronger. The most memorable thing is that even one time when I told him my real age, since I look way younger than I am. He seemed a little thrown back by this and I told him maybe it was time for us to end this relationship. After a week he texted me saying he still wanted to talk to me and now we are communicating everyday and we have a strong relationship. This experience has showed to me that there is people who deeply care about me, and that I am a desirable person. Not just for one night stands, but for relationships too. My confidence has greatly expanded thanks to this encounter. I hope our relationship lasts a long time.",,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47KX1J732
