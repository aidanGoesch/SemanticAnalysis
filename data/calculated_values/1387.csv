It's an entire 2600 miles away and I've, quite literally, never moved out of the state of Florida even though I've travelled plenty. Even though I'm thirty three years old, it doesn't stop my parents from worrying and missing me every day. It just so happens that this year my Mother was turning fifty back in June. I made the arrangements to fly home and throw her a surprise party with my sister-in-law. It was a whirlwind trip but it was definitely worth it! My Mom isn't much for being the center of attention or professing her emotions beyond what is necessary. In fact, it is quite possible I've seen my Dad cry more than I have seen her cry. That is saying a lot! At her birthday party, she was clearly very surprised when she arrived. There were easily a hundred people in attendance. The greatest moment of all, though, was when her eyes finally landed on me. She started CRYING and then she started laughing and then she cried some more. Her legs just about gave out from underneath her. To make things even better, it was all caught on tape! I will never, for the rest of my life, forget that moment. It is one of my very favorite memories.",,382M9COHEI1UPKMF9RCOBNP18E6EU4
