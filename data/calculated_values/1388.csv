She told me that she has always wanted to go to Rome too and we should plan a trip there. For my birthday, a month later, she surprised me by giving me a gladiator toy. I asked her what was this and she told me it's a hint to what she got me. I stared at her like she had lost her mind and she told me ""Rome? Do you remember that?"" and I looked at the toy and she pulled out plane tickets for Rome! I was so shocked! I asked her when were we going and she said in July and I hugged her. Then in July, we went to Rome! We saw everything we could see! It was amazing. As soon as we got the Colosseum, she got down on one knee and asked me to marry her. I was like ""What are you doing? Are you serious!"" She asked me to marry her again and I said ""OF COURSE!"" She jumped up and hugged me! It was so special to us since we both love Rome. She told me later that as soon as she heard that was something we both wanted to do, she wanted to make it as special as she could.",,382M9COHEI1UPKMF9RCOBNP1XVRUES
