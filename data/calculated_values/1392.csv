I couldn't see anything because it was still before the sun came up, so I had to walk slowly and feel my way over to the bathroom. When I finally got there, I turned the light on and saw that the wetness was from blood dripping down my legs. I shouted for my husband and we immediately drove to the hospital. I was 8 months pregnant so, I was worried that I had possibly lost the baby, and the blood was the sign. As soon as we got to the hospital, I was checked to see if I was dilated at all. They immediately informed me I was 8 centimeters dilated and needed to be admitted to give birth. I immediately was given the epidural, so after a while I didn't feel any pain, thank goodness. Little by little my family started trickling into the room to be there for the delivery. I was only there for about ten minutes before my doctor showed up. She walked out of the room for a second and then came back to pop my water. As soon as that was done, the contractions sped up, and I was ready to start pushing within the next twenty minutes. I started pushing once I was told to. The pushing only lasted about ten minutes before my son was born. It was such an incredible experience that I will never forget.",382M9COHEI1UPKMF9RCOBNP1YJ9EU7,
