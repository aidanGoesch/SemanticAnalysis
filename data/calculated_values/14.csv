I always relied on my dad and step-mom for guidance and support. Anytime  I had a problem, I could always count on them, whether it be general life advice, help bailing me out on a late rent payment, or just general hanging out. I always thought they'd be there for ever. I kinda took it for granted. This all changed about three months or so ago. I hadn't been in contact in a while. I figured"" hey, they're doing fine, enjoying retirement and the empty nester life. Let me let them enjoy their down time"". This all changed when I got a call from my uncle,telling me I should get in contact with them immediately . At fist I was like ""I'm sure they're fine"". But after must insistence, I made a visit to there homes. Boy, am I glad I did. Walking through the doors of my childhood home, I was immediately greeted by the sights and smells of a hording situation. It turns out that not only is my step-mother in the advanced stages of dementia, my father has stage four liver cancer. Neither of them have much longer to live. Just goes to show, you can't take anything for granted in this life, especially your family.",,304SM51WA4QG34IRAVFYVE1SKNTBSC
