It was after a Sunday religious service we are all a part of on a hot summer day. We all arranged together how we would get there and where we were going. We drove in three separate cars. We arrived at an area of a river where there was a canal that had deep and slow moving water. It was a short walk to the area, and we had to climb down a rocky ledge to reach it. I decided to go in fast while the others were tentative because of the cold water. When getting in, I scraped my arm on the rock I was holding while lowering myself. It made me feel rather clumsy and then I started worrying about if it might get infected. I didn't make a big deal of it because I didn't want to ruin anyone else's time. We all swam for a little while, then gathered in a shallow area and just sat and talked for a while. At one point I decided to get up and explore some of the rocky area around the swimming hole. Being with the group was reminding me of times as a kid when I went swimming in these kinds of places with friends. It was making me sad that I don't do it that often anymore. So I felt that going of on my own and gathering my emotions would be best. I walked around on the rocks and looked at the trees of the forest behind it. Then I found a spot in the shade and laid down for the remainder of our time there. A friend yelled up to me that we were leaving so then we all climbed back up the ledge and got in the cars and left.",3137ONMDKHRBK2LKPMN778OAFZ3EGI,
