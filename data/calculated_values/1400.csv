As a teenager, you never saw me without my Nikon. I was always in the photo lab at school. Even in my senior photo, I've got a camera around my neck. Becoming a professional photographer was a life long dream for me. Working at the photo mart in the mall in high school was my launch into my career. When I got hired onto the newspaper, I was extatic. But getting my first portrait published into a national magazine was a huge milestone. To see MY picture. Right there on the cover. I could never have imagined it. But there it was, my picture on the cover of Time Magazine. My name in the credits of Time freaking magazine! The sky is the limit. The last three months since my picture appeared, I've been getting calls from all around the world. The future is bright.",,384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59JKG0SR
