I don't even recollect what happened and transpired fully. Doctor Mike had always wanted to do this tilt table test for me. I have been having this headaches regularly these days, and he felt this test would give a conclusive diagnosis. I was hesitant but i finally agreed. I remember i was shivering as i walked into the clinic this morning. God, i always hated the smell of hospitals. But i was surprisingly ok today. Doc was kind enough to not keep me waiting for long. He made me lie down on a table and i was tied down on it. Then the table started tilting all the way around. At first it was slow, then it gained speed. I felt anxious. I remember sweat rolling down upon my cheeks. Last thing i remember is a bright light. I had passed out. It was very embarrassing.",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0Z7WI6QX
