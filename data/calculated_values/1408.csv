There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to it, other than certain things like heat could make it a lot worse. My doctor suspected that I might have a condition called POTS. It took a lot of testing and medical visits before I was finally referred to a heart hospital for a test called a tilt table test. I was strapped to a table that is eventually raised to about 80 degrees. During this time, four people in the room monitored my vital signs such as blood pressure and pulse. By comparing what these two numbers do, they can diagnose certain conditions such as POTS. As time went on, I was not passing out. I began to be concerned that it would not happen. It seemed the PA got bored, because he crossed his arms and just stared as if I were exasperating him. Every once in a while I was asked if I was having my symptoms. At one point I heard him tell the nurse I would need a saline infusion even if nothing happened, which seemed a bit odd. I was sad that I was not passing out. For decades I have had this condition, and it seemed that I would not be diagnosed with something after all. (I have since found out most people with this condition don't even faint during the test, so I was ill informed.) I remember saying I felt a bit odd, though I couldn't sense the symptoms strongly because I was so secure on that table, even with a pillow behind my head, so I didn't have the ability to feel very dizzy. After the second time I said that, I remember coming to, to lying down on the table, and the nurse asking, ""How much of that do you remember?"" I said I remembered saying I felt odd, and she replied, ""Wow."" I was so grateful I had fainted that I came to laughing and joking with them. Rather than being afraid about fainting, it was a huge relief that I did! And since then I have finally been diagnosed with POTS.",386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0Z7WI6QX,
