I loved cars for as long as I can remember. While in Florida, I met a girl who owned a cherry 1960s Mustang. It was pristine, and the story this girl told me about it was incredible. It was restored and looked like it just came off the showroom floor. This was about six months ago. Time certainly flies. But me and her started to talk more and more. We started sharing common interests. I couldn't believe how awesome this girl was. Eventually, after a while, we started dating. It's admittedly a little complicated given the distance, but things are working out. We see each other as often as we can. I think things will be just fine between us. The car? Well that's pretty great too.",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZCID6Q5
