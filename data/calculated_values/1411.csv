I was travelling with a family friend of mine to Florida where we met this very beautiful girl while we were filling up on gas. She was driving a 1960's Mustang. I think that is what led me to go on and ask her how she got it. We started discussing and how she too was travelling to Florida. I eventually got to the point of asking about her car.  She told me one of the most surprising stories ever! Supposedly, the car she had was inherited from her father who literally found it stored away at a broken down shelter. It really surprised me because I've heard of such ""barn finds"" but I never really got to witness it. She told me how her father found it in non-working state, and he worked on it for years on and off to get it working and back on it's former shape. After getting it back to proper working condition, her father looked around for the owner and never found him/her. However, after her father passed away, which was unfortunate, she did find the owner of the car. The guy said, the he never imagined his lost car to be brought back to life like this and he was actually happy for her and pretty much let her go with it. Honestly I was really inspired by it since the car I want to have is also a vintage on like that. We soon exchanged numbers and we drove alongside each other, my family friend also really enjoyed her company. I eventually got to know her more and we started dating!",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZCID6Q5
