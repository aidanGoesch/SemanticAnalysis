She said the child could be born with a horrible disease where it will need support for the rest of it's life. I couldn't believe how horrible life was treating my friend. I tried to think of something or anything to say or do to help her through the situation but I was stuck in awe at how negative the situation was. I remember thinking, ""Wow, this is what they mean when they say anything could happen at anytime."" I did try to console her. She was brave to even let me know. I needed to respond with positive energy and hope. It was extrememly hard for me to look on the bright side of the situation. The situation was so negative and bleak. I would be crazy to say that everything is going to be OK. I needed to be real and honest. I just said I would always be there for her, but I wanted to DO more than that. I wanted to research how I could help in the future. The more I read about the disease, the sadder I became. I couldn't believe such a wonderful nice girl was going through something this horrible.",386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZDCWQ6X,
