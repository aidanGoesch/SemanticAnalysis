I knew the only way for me to grow was to get out and do new things. In life that's one of the most important things to become your best self. Back home I basically worked every entry level job already. So I had a little too much experience and couldn't pick up much more work. I was ready for a change so I moved to florida. I didn't know anyone when I had gotten there. I just got out there and started to explore. I knew something would come up just being active and experienced. I was able to meet new people and do things that I haven't done before. I really enjoyed doing these things. I think it's cool to meet people and do things with them. thats how relationships are made.  It was really great and made me realize even more this move was right. It has made me stronger and more independent woman and for that I am so grateful.,,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZEZFQ6R
