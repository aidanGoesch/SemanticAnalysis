I do.  I woke up one morning about 6 weeks ago with the worst stomach pain imaginable.  It was beyond belief. I am such a deep sleeper I knew it must be bad to have awakened me.  It made me curl up in a fetal position and cry.  I knew something was terribly wrong.  But I have no medical training and didn't know what could be wrong. I knew I needed help, but I live alone.  Usually this is fantastic-I have freedom.  No one eats my ice cream;  I can have soup for dinner;  Cereal is great for lunch too. But in an emergency, living alone is a liability.  I needed help, fast, but there was no one. Almost.- but Lily the cat wasn't going to help. I worked up my courage and swallowed my fear of what was happening. It felt like a furball.  I  stumbled to my car.  I told Lily I would be back soon (I hoped it would be true). I don't know how I drove to the hospital without being in an accident.  I guess the need to not incur an ambulance bill is a desperate motivator. I stumbled into the ER.  They say I need surgery for an appendix that will burst.  Lily is not going to like this.  Not at all.",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZF106QX
