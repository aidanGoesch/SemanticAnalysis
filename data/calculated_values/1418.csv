It was around 4 in the morning and I suddenly had the worst stomach cramps I had ever felt. I at first thought it might be gas or a muscle strain, but it ended up being much worse. I kept just dealing with the pain tossing and turning until I got the sudden wave of nauseous that I needed to throw up.  Once I was in the bathroom throwing up still holding on top the pain in my stomach I knew something was wrong. I knew I couldn't drive myself to the hospital and I didn't want to call an ambulance. I knew my dad leaves the city to head to work early in the day so I asked him to please pick me up and bring me to the emergency room. By this time it was about 6:30am in the morning. When I got to the emergency room they asked me a lot of questions mostly thinking it was gas or food poisoning. Once they saw how much pain I was in they gave me an IV with some pain medicine and told me I would be getting a Cat Scan done to see what was going on. The results from the cat scan were that my appendix was inflamed and was in danger of rupturing and needed to be removed immediately.  Within about 30 minutes of the cat scan results I was in the surgery room. It was very scary because I was all alone and given how sudden and fast paced everything was going I didn't have time to call anyone. Plus it was now about 9am in the morning and I knew anyone I called would be starting their work day. Rather than distributing anyone's work day I just under went the surgery alone without telling anyone. Once I awoke from surgery and everything was fine I called my dad and sister to let them know and ask that they go to my house for me and feed my cats. I had to stay overnight in the hospital to make sure I recovered ok.  I ended up being out of work for just about a week and was overall really lucky I went in when I did. Had I ignored the pain my appendix would of ruptured causing alot of damage.",386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZF106QX,
