The first thing that I was asked to do was feed all of the animals. There were were a lot more dogs than there were cats, which made me pretty happy because I don't care for cats that much. I finished doing all of that and watched them all chow down on some good quality kibble that someone had donated the day before. I was told that they don't receive a lot of high quality food donations, so this was really helpful. There are so many dogs here that it takes a large bag of kibble a day just to keep them fed. After feeding them all, it was time to start bathing the new pets that were brought to us this morning. I'm most comfortable washing small dogs, so I washed the 2 pomeranians that were brought in and left the Rottweiler to someone more experienced than me. I loved both of the little fluff balls, but the white one (a girl) was not happy with her bath at all. She was nervous and whining the entire time, while the brown one (a boy) was a champ about the whole thing. I bathed the white one first so she could get out and get dried off I was able to use a blow dryer on her, so she got dry pretty quickly. The boy pom was a lot easier to deal with, so it didn't take me long to bathe him off. They were both infested with fleas, the poor things. I get upset when I see animals mistreated like this. There's no excuse to be eaten up with fleas like that at all. All it takes is a regular bath to keep them mostly off and I don't understand why people can't do that like they're supposed to. I wish I could take both of these babies home with me. I think I'm going to move.",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZF1R6QO
