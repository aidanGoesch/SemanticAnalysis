Ever since I adopted him from the shelter, he has been my best friend, always by my side, especially during my worst times. As he grew older, people always complimented him on his large, fluffy white coat. He is such a beauty! Since he is my best friend and family member, I would do anything for him. I love him so, so much. Two weeks ago, I went on vacation with my family. I left Reggie at home alone, hiring a trusted sitter to check in on him 2x a day, walk him, and change his food and water. You can only imagine the fear I felt when, while in another country, I got a panicked call from Anna, letting me know Reggie had been hurt! I was so scared and so far away from him. I'm so lucky I trust Anna - she told me that the came over one morning to take care of Reggie. She called for him, but he didn't come running as usual. After searching for him, she found him in my laundry room, hiding in a corner and whining. He had gotten into my sewing supplies, where I keep sharp needles, scissors, seamrippers, and other tools, and accidentally stabbed himself in the eye. He could barely open it in the pictures I saw. After calling me, she rushed him to the emergency vet who he has been seeing for years, where they found out he had a hole in his cornea. Luckily, since it was found quickly, they were able to do surgery to save the eye. I still had a few days left on my trip, which I tried to enjoy, but it was hard. Thank goodness Reggie is okay now, after taking meds and wearing a cone and eye patch for a few weeks. Next time I will have to put my supplies away much better, he gave me such a huge scare.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6A012LJ7
