It was a cool spring afternoon and I was really excited. I met up with my friends to see what they had planned for me. Sadly, no one seemed to remember it was my birthday. I felt very depressed and not cared for as I hung out with them. I went home to a homemade cake made by my mom. I enjoyed eating it but still felt said that not one of my 'friends' wish me. Just as I was about to go to bed, I heard a noise from downstairs. I went down and turned on the lights. To my surprise, the house was filled. My friends popped out of doors, stairway, and kitchen and yelled 'SURPRISE"". I was shook. I felt extremely heart warmed. This was my first surprise birthday. I went to bed feeling loved and cared for.",386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGBOLJT,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGBOLJT
