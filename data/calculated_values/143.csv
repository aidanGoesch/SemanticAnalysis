I got awarded my PhD. I was the first in my family to do anything beyond a bachelors degree and i am very proud. My whole family was there supporting me and my nephew thinks its cool that I am a doctor now. I was inspired to keep going to school to become a therapist because I was involved with speech therapy as a kid. I had a lisp and anxiety about speaking. Now i am able to speak confidently and with no nervousness thanks to her. She made a huge impact on my life and I want to give that back. my next step will be finding a job or opening a practice. I am open to work with anyone but would love to focus on young adults having the same issues I did. I feel as though i could make meaningful connections with them. After the ceremony we all went out for dinner. I got a lot of doctor themed cards and my brother bought me a get well soon balloon. I still have not found a career but am only 3 months out of school. Some day soon I hope to have my own practice but time will tell. The future is looking bright, and though I am sad to finally be leaving school, I am happy to start the next chapter in my life.",,317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZIFNINQ
