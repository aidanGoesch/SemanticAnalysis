We purchased their best plants and then headed out to enjoy the rest of the nature and scenery as well as a few other fun activities. We decided to do a bit of hiking in some near by woods, set down on a homemade blanket my mom made me when I was 12 and enjoyed our surroundings whilst lighting up a blaze. I laid back to admire the tall tress reaching for the heavens, I closed my eyes to listen to the wind blowing through the leaves. I could hear the others laughing and talking among themselves and I smiled, I smiled because they were smiling. I stretched out my arms, stretched them out as wide as I could, as if I was trying to each either side of the woods. I dug my fingers into the soil, as the soil dug back deep underneath my finger nails. After passing our rolled plant around a bit, a few puffs later we decided to head down to a local ranch to do a bit of horseback riding but first we stopped by a casino because someone wanted to hit the slots. I'm not much for throwing my coins down the toilet so I just watched the others and after just a bit we left. When we finally got to the ranch my head was a bit funny, I had the giggles and the horses were absolutely stunning. We went into the barn to pick out the horses we wanted and I picked out the one that I felt was my spirit animal, her name was June and she was magnificent. We all got saddled up and started along a path, the sun was shinning, the whether was perfect and I had this powerful beast between my legs, it was turning out to be the perfect day, until I slipped off and nearly busted my ass; turns out I got so wrapped up in the moment that I forgot to hold on to the reins. After falling off the horse, I was a little shook but I barely felt a thing, thanks to the legal plants we part took earlier that day. We headed to a local dinner after the ranch, being that we were all starving and/or had the munchies; I ordered something greasy and unhealthy, like the rest; I promise to hit the gym sometime next Tuesday. After a long day we all headed back, I fell asleep in the back of the car, my head resting of the shoulder of my BFF and my wannabe lover, with the light summer breeze on my skin, and a smile permanently print on my soul...This was definitely a day I will always remember.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGT3LJ8
