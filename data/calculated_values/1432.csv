Then we decided to do a fun activity that none of us has ever done before. We landed on horseback riding. Found a place in the mountains just above central city, and bought an hour long ride. We had about an hour to kill before the ride, so we stopped at a casino just below the mountains. I played slots for an hour. The drinks were complementary, but they really aren't. You end up paying for them when you dump your money in the machines lol. 3 beers cost me $100+. We then made our way to the place somewhat high up in the mountains. Our instructor was very young...maybe 18, but the way she rode her horse was simply remarkable. The experience is vividly memorable in my mind. There's nothing like hearing the wind blowing in the mountains....sounds like a train or a really fast car going by you at a high rate of speed. I was really enjoying myself until a younger trainer started to yell at me. I didnt know what was wrong until she told me that I hadn't been holding the reins the whole time. The horse was just following the others and I had no control over it. Even though the ride didn't go perfectly, it was easily the most enjoyable time of my life.",386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGT3LJ8,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGT3LJ8
