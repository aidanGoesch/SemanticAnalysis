I was impressed by the things that I saw, yet still disappointed. It was interesting to see the place we play baseball and some of the famous architecture that we have. I have also struggled with ageism in the work place and got a really good glimpse of it yesterday which was so disappointing. We were outside walking around at noon when all the office workers come out for lunch. The area we were in only had 1 or 2 people out of hundreds that were above the age of 30. I could not believe it. There were people everywhere and yet they were so young. This is not fair at all. We have worked just as hard to get our education and work experience, yet we are being pushed out of working for being older workers. Yeah right, id 40's is now considered an older worker!. Anyway, I was nice to get away for a while and spend some time with a friend. We had to wait 3 hours. So we had plenty of time to see the sites and experience out state capital fully. I was impressed by how big everything is in the big city. I saw magazine covers, people working out right in the middle of the area. Scooters. Rentable bikes. Food everywhere.",386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AJWQJL2,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AJWQJL2
