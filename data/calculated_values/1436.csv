My wife had a serious talk with me and I guess I didn't realize how obnoxious I had been. Ever since the baby was born I haven't really been pulling my weight around the house. I was coming home from work everyday and playing video games and staring at my cell phone. I didn't mean to be unhelpful, I just got caught up in feeling overwhelmed I guess. And my wife never asks for help, so I just thought she had it all under control. After she talked to me I realized I was very wrong. She was about to lose her mind and I am glad she spoke up. I felt terrible, I never meant to add extra stress to her day. After that conversation I have been trying to be helpful and present at all times.  I know I still probably have a long way to go but I am really trying. I asked my wife today how she was feeling about the situation and she seemed a little bit less angry. I also don't want her to think I am just helping out because she wants me to. It is a difficult situation to fix. But it is my fault that the situation exists so I am going to keep trying. I think I am on the right track. I hope anyway.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6APCTJL7
