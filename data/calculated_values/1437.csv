When I come home from work I want to relax, but she needs me to help out and spend time with her and the boys. I understand where she is coming from. I told her I was going to try and do better from here on out. It made me feel bad to know that she thinks I am not a good husband and father. I was very upset by the conversation. I want to do better going forward. This is not the first time and probably not the last time we will have this fight. I wish I could tell her she is wrong. I know she is right though. I hate fighting with my wife. I love her and want to do right by her. I also want to do right by my kids. My family is going to be my focus moving forward. This fight had changed me.",386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6APCTJL7,
