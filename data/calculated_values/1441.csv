Heavy stuff to start off with i know, it was a very difficult time for as she was my last remaining close family. When i heard the news it was like my world was over. Mom and i were pretty close and we talked on the phone practically every day, it was like i lost my best friend and my mother. Afterwards i had to leave my job, i was just too emotional to keep working, i still get a little choked up when i think about her but its better now, mostly. My boss and coworkers were very understanding of my situation and there was no hard feelings in me leaving. I'm not gonna lie, i was a bit of a mess. I didn't fall off the rails too hard but i did go through a long period of depression were it was a effort to get out of bed in the morning. That went on for awhile until some of my friends invited me to one of their church group cookouts. i kinda felt like a third-wheel and was dragging down the atmosphere but i appreciated the thought. i found it to be a very good experience and the food was delicious. After everyone left my friend asked if i wanted to join his group for other church events, and i said yes. they certainly kept me busy let me tell you, not that i minded. I think that was primarily what helped get me through my crisis. and at the end i liked involving myself so much that i became a regular face at church. Diary, if there is one good thing that came out of this, its that i found and renewed my faith in God.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AR1XJLR
