I was an only child and my father passed when I was very young. She was the last close family I had left. It was so unexpected because nobody in her family had heart problems. I couldn't believe she died of a heart attack. She was old for a mother when she had me. Older than 40. But she lived a long life. This unexpected death totally threw my life into chaos. I had to take leave from work to make the funeral arrangements, settle all of her financials and clean and prepare the house for sale. I had to do this all the while feeling so sad and lonely. I am divorced and childless and I feel like I have nobody close to me anymore. To fill the void I have tried to renew my faith in God. I have started to go back to church. I had not been in many years. Hopefully this will fill the void I have and I will meet some good people. Nothing will replace my mother though.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AR1XJLR
