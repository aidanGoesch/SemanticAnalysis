It was my dear horse, one I had owned since I was a little girl. He had seemed fine--he wasn't irritable or stressed out at all that morning. I remember brushing his mane and going back in for a bit to get a few chores done--a few hours later I came outside and he was failing. It was 10 AM, he was barely holding on, I tried calling the vet and when they came there was nothing they could do. I saw him die in front of me, and I had to bury him that night. I have never felt so devastated. I didn't know what to do, to be honest with you--how do you deal with such a loss? He was my best friend. He was everything to me for so long, I had gotten him from my parents. He's just about as old as I am! Like a little sibling. Or, he was, I guess. He was very kind, but I guess age catches up to us all eventually. I'm in my 30s now, and he was a gift from my parents. They knew how close we were.",,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DOORR0R
