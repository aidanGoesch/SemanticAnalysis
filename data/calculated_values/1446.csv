I was happy to be getting away from everything. The only bad thing is there was absolutely no cell phone service in the area, but it was nice to be disconnected for a while. We spent the weekend laying around by the lake and just relaxing. My girlfriends parents are really great and they cooked a nice dinner for us the first night. We didn't really do much else other than lay around. It was a much needed break from the crazy pace of my life. I felt like I got a lot closer to my girlfriends family too, which was nice. After the weekend was over we got into the car to head back home. I turned my cell phone on once we got out of the mountain range and was surprised to see I had over 20 missed calls. They were all from my best friend Ben. I immediately called him back and he was on the other end crying. His mother had died that morning. I felt absolutely horrible that I hadn't been there for him when it happened. He knew it wasn't my fault that I hadn't answered the phone, but I still felt really bad. The rest of the car ride home was very stressful. I couldn't wait to get home to go see Ben and his family. It was a really sad ending to an amazing weekend.",,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DQFJ0RC
