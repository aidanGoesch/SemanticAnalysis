I received a call right away from the vet tech explaining that my dog's lymph nodes were swollen and it could be a sign of something wrong.  She recommended that I have a fine needle test poke done to see what it could be.  After a few days I received the test results.  They seemed unsure as to what it was but there seemed to be some bad cells in her report.  I was advised to do a lymph node biopsy right away.  Once that was complete it was about a 7-10 day sleepless night wait.  I was extremely worried I was going to lose my dog to cancer or some infection. I spent a lot of time with her.  We went on walks and car rides.  I realized that this scare really made me thing how short our pets time is. they really have a short lifespan and it's worth it to spend as much time as you can with your pet.  They deserve it.  just when I couldn't take the worry and anxiety anymore, the vet called.   she said my dog did not have cancer but some rare lymph node issue and there really wasn't much I could do.  It seemed something odd and rare.  She's still doing well after all these months. That was a really big scare for me. I'm glad she is going to live.",,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DWZ80RB
