We have a very good relationship and I appreciate all of his thoughtfulness. It is one of my favorite things about him, how romantic he can be. For our 3rd wedding anniversary we had the idea to go and eat dinner. The special aspect of this particular event was the fact that we went to the resort we got married at. It was great going there, the nostalgia I felt made me very happy. I enjoyed the wedding immensely and you could tell not much had changed there. The resort is a beautiful place, I felt as though I was welcomed right away, and I really enjoyed the food. I think my husband knew how much I enjoyed being there, because he seemed very contented with himself the entire evening. Needless to say we both enjoyed ourselves a great deal. We had a lot of fun and the food was delicious. I will admit we had more wine than we probably should have. The entrees were actually reasonably priced as well. I think it is safe to say we will be going back to this place in the future as well. I am so grateful to my husband for how thoughtful he is. He is very good at telling what I like and appreciate. I am not sure how he is such a good husband but I am just grateful to have him in my life. We will have a great life together, I cannot deny that. I appreciate everything he does for me.",,38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LNHBOMQ
