Will he fit in easily? Will he make friends easily? Will he like his new teachers? Will the school eb the right environment for him? Will he come home happy or feel anxious and lonely in his new school? Will PS3 be a good fit for him? I really wanted this to work out for him. I wanted him to feel welcome and integrate well with his new classmates, teachers and studies. I dropped him off the first day and hugged him as he left the car and watched as he walked into the building. I looked at the kids walking into the building after him, they seemed happy and comfortable. I hoped my son would end the day feeling the same way. I went to work that day still worried, but I tried to focus on work and prayed all would be well for him. When it was time to pick him up, I was anxious but I tried to stay calm and optimistic. I waited for him to come out and spotted him walking out with two young boys he was talking to with a smile on his face. I was so relieved. I had hoped he would make friends quickly and I couldn't wait to ask him about his first day! he saw me and came towards the car as he said goodbye to his new friends. He got into the seat next to me and say ""Hi, dad!"". I asked him how his day was and he told me with a smile that he really liked the school and his new classes and that his math teacher was really cool. he said he'd met some pretty nice kids and then asked if he could invite them over sometime next week to play video games after school. I was so happy! ""Of course you can!"" I said, ""just make sure you do your homework first."" I said and he hugged me, then we drove off home. My son loves his new school and has made two great new friends he hangs out with often which is perfect.",,38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LPYFOMU
