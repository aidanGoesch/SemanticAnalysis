This is all new to me, and it came at me like a freight train. There was so much growing up done in the last two months, I barely recognized my little girl. I was planning parties, and attending parties, and getting finances in order, and trying to be happy all at the same time. I thought I was ready for her to be an ""adult"". I realized quickly that I wasn't. It's hard to watch your kids grow. It makes you think back to all the people you wanted in your life to see this, that aren't with you anymore. It is the most crazy time in my life. I think back and the first day of kindergarten wasn't that long ago, was it? We had a great grad party, all her friends were here. We had all of our family over. We ordered so much food, and the biggest cake ever. We all had such a great time. I realized then, that she was growing up, and that her friends weren't really ""kids"" anymore either. It wasn't soon after the grad party that she was already getting her things in order to start college. I will admit that a little part of me is glad that she is going to college locally and staying at home. It's nice to keep them as long as you can. She's been in college for two weeks now. Stress is real to her now, and to me. I think we have both done some growing up and realizations have occurred that we are moving on in life together, just in different ways. And it's harder for some of us to do it gracefully, but we do our best.",,38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LQ0OMO6
