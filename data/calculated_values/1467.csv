It was such a great event. I got to see her walk down the hall and kiss the bride. Everybody in the church was in tears. The cake was huge. It was a few feet tall. I loved eating the cake. She cried half the time. She was in so much joy and I was happy for her. She married a oil tycoon. She will have it easy and hopefully I'll get some gifts from the husband. I hope her the best. She said she'll have a kid in the next few years. I hope her the best in her family and future family. I went home feeling proud. She will have a great life in this world.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8U9C2H7P
