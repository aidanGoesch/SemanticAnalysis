Since it was the big 10 and finally those double digits, we wanted to do something special for him. He was finally old enough to make all the choices on his own and we told him that any thing he wanted, he could have. Within reason of course! We told him to inviate all the freinds from class if he wanted and anybody else that he had in mind. We as parents, also included the parents in on a lot of this since its as much a vacation away from the kids for some, as it is for hanging out and drinking with the other parents can be just as much fun. My son always has loved the fiar on the baord walk. It was a lot of fun to go there as we have always been going his entire life. He loves going on the ferris wheel and playing all the carnival games they have there. We try to do our best to make sure he doesnt get too too discouraged playing the games though! After the fair, we took a trip to his favorite noodle bar. He loves being able to choose his own dinner. Mom usually keeps a tight lease around us at dinner time, so whenever he gets a chance to do his own thing, he absolutely loves. Afterwards we all went home and opened presents with him. Some kids choose to leave early since it was a long day, whereas others wanted to come over and hang out in the pool. Overall, i would like to imagine the little guy had an amazing birthday, atleast according to how fast he went to bed that evening and fell asleep, I would say he did as well!",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UBKHH7M
