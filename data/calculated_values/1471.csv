Where he ordered the pork dish. It always suprise  me that he chooses to eat the brown egg and all the seaweed bits which he would not eat normally if you give them to him. He went on all the adult rides he showed no fear going on the rides even though some of him friends did. He got a new camera for his birthday so he was practising his pictures through out the day so we have a good record of the day through his perspective,.He woke up really early because he was so exited by the day he planned a head. Normally it is hard to wake him up in the morning. But  when he is motivated I guess its easy for a child to wake up. He started the day with his favourte breakfast which was bacon and eggs. He then went on to open his presents. Which included the camera but he also got the ipad he has been wanting. It was really easy to set up but he had to wait for the ipad to cahrge which took some time. we had to go through the app store to download the apps he has seem on his game shows. We then went and met his friends we rented a large suv to carry all of them and the kids parents were happy to see them go. we first went to his noodle resturant. where we had to order for 6 fussy kids, which was fun.",38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UBKHH7M,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UBKHH7M
