What a story! I really wanted to have a natural birth - it was written down on my birth plan and everything. When contractions started at home, they were very sporadic. Over the next 72 hours, I labored slowly at home, practicing every pain management technique I had researched (the bathtub worked best for me). Towards the third day, the pain was intense and the doctor recommended I check into the hospital. As I settled in, the nurses recommended I get an epidural to help manage the pain. As I waited on the epidural, they suddenly ordered an ultrasound. It scared me a little. Was something wrong? Everything looked fine on the screen, to me. When the doctor came in, he gave me the news. My baby had turned from head down to transverse and there wasn't time to try to turn him. The baby monitor showed signs of distress. I had no choice but to have an emergency c-section. They put me to sleep and when I woke up, my husband told me our son was beautiful. I couldn't wait to hold him! It was all worth it when my sweet baby boy was placed in my arms and I was finally able to gaze into his chubby little face. I love him so much!",,317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZSCQNI2
