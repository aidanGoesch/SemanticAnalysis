My husband was driving and I was sitting next to him. We always have amazing time when we are driving somewhere. I can say that I enjoy being in the car together, because of conversations we have and gossiping about family here and there (like every family does). My husband was so much into conversation. He really like gossips. I have to admit that he is horrible with attention. They say that men can't do more things in once and I totally agree with this saying. While he was so much into conversation and he wanted to change a line, he did not see the car coming. We were on highway so our car, as well as the other car were driving so fast.  We almost had very bad car crush. I was shaking from the fear and stress and I started to cry. My husband felt so bad, he stopped the car when it was possible and hugged and kissed me so much. Later on he said that for a second the idea of losing me came into his mind. I had exactly the same on my mind. Since that time we are driving slower and so responsible. We both realized how fragile are our lives and how much we love each other.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UJPH7HU
