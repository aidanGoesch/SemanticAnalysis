I must say that after 3 weeks, everything has been fixed and taken care of.  I realized that my husband's reluctance to resolve these problems was causing a delay.  I felt I needed to take matters into my own hands.  I got one car to the shop. While it was in the shop, I called a contractor to fix our bathroom.  A week later, I got the other car fixed.  I have a feeling that my husband's reluctance only spurred me into action. It got me thinking of ways to fix problems myself.  I must admit I am grateful for realizing that.  Now I see that I am capable of getting things done if my husband can't tend to things right away. I still love him with all my heart.  I could be more a DIYer someday. I enjoyed learning how to take care of stuff. A good experience to learn from.",,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7O4MMF9
