The trash is now piling up and I have flies taking over the house, with sick sweetly smell. I do not know how much I can take of this. I have bothered my children in the past few months for rides and such, that I am not going to brother them any more, because there is a vehicle that just needs a transmission put in, so really three vehicle down, but I can not get him to work on that, heck he don't even gets out there till about 5 or 6 pm, and maybe works an hour. He stays in the bathroom for most of the day and night, he says he has to poop, but I think after two hours of either sleeping or playing a game on the phone, that he is not going to poop. He has not fixed the other bathroom yet either and the floor in our bathroom is falling apart, I have fell thru twice and he fell thru once last week. He just keeps coming up with that he does not have this or that, when a year ago he said that he had everything but would not work on it, now he needs two x fours and everything else. I just don't think he wants to do the work, but he does not want anyone else doing it. I just don't know what I am going to do, but I am getting sick a lot. I am thinking that I am going to have to ask son, to take me in for a while and see if that don't get things done. I just don't know what to do anymore, I am tired of sounding like a broken record or a nagging fish wife, but what am I suppose to do. I know if I go to my son's house he will be very upset with me, but he is not getting it that all he is not doing or fixing it, is making me sick. I am barely out here working, with that smell, but I need the money. I c.an not say how long I will stay at this point, I mean for the last 5 months the car's have been. The Last 6 years for the second bathroom to be down.  Now the question is when is it time to leave because you are tired of it will be fixed tonight, or bathroom will be fix when kids are gone, so what am I suppose to do",38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7O4MMF9,
