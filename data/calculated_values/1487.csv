The man in charge of the suit was no where to be found.  and the car to travel to the city broke down. it was one of the longest 10 hours of my life. I could not think straight and i was without clue. i really didnt know what to do. it taught me how to be strong in the face of pressure. we got to know the men in charge of these items were drunk on alcohol and slept off. we boarded a train to the city.  because the car couldnt be fixed... every other thing fell in place.  and everyone was happyit was a joyful occassion. Even though it was crazy from the start. It was one of the greatest weddings. everyone was in smiles.,,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7V6YFMP
