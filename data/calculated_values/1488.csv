I often consider her my real daughter. She was geting married in Las Vegas about three mothes ago. I was so happy for her. What a great success. I flew into Vegas to watch her get married. I had to fly because I live all the way in Portland. The Flight was very entertaining. I flew first class all they way. I was looking out the window the whole time and the view was amazing. There was a delightful two year old sitting next to me. He loved to dance and sing while seated. I found this extremely cute and funny. The trip was also very memorable because I got to see a beautiful wedding. I also got to see a beautiful girl.,,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7WFBFML
