It was our first time there and also our first time travelling cross country. On the flight there, we chose to upgrade to first class, so i got my first ever experience in it. First, when we arrived at the airport, we went into the cardholder's lounge, since my husband has access. We had some good foods and ordered a couple of drinks before out flight. Then, when it was time to board, we were the first ones on the plane. We settled in to our seats where there was a blanket and pillow waiting. My son was already looking through the in-flight-entertainment catalog to see what movie he would watch during the flight.  The flight was around 5 hours long, so we had plenty of time to enjoy the amenities. Midway through, lunch was served, and it came with a very tasty ice cream cup. I ended up getting to watch 2 movies on the plane, one of them being the wonderful remake of Mary Poppins. The flight then landed smoothly and we were off to our hotel. We chose to stay off the strip, in order for a more family-friendly accommodation. When it was time for the wedding, we got to explore all that the Las Vegas Strip has to offer. We even ate dinner at the glamorous Caesar's Palace. Overall, the trip was very memorable and a once in a lifetime experience!",,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7WFBFML
