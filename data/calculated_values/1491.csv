For many years I have focused my studies on female empowerment as well as women's rights, so it was an honor to be asked to speak.  I was exceedingly nervous leading up to the event; I had written my speech as well as made my presentation before but this time it was different.  The attendees at this conference were a lot of big names in my city as well as community.  I spent the weeks leading up to the presentation studying my material and going over my slides; I had it down perfectly.  When the day finally came, I was so nervous.  I paced my hotel room for hours going over the material in my head, I visualized it going perfect in my head.  The ride down the elevator to the ballroom and walking to the room felt like it took hours, but once I finally got to the podium all my emotions went away.  I knew my material and I was so excited to share something I was passionate about to some people that I really cared about and were foremost in their field.  The presentation went off without a hitch and I received a lot of great questions from the audience.  A one hour presentation felt like it went by in seconds!  After I finished, I was greeted with a strong applause and a lot of smiles and cheers.  I felt so proud of myself and so excited that it was done.  I met many of my colleagues afterward and they congratulated me on a well done presentation as well as great material.  I was asked to speak next year as the keynote and I could not be more excited.  All of my hard work, patience, and excitement paid off.  I am already looking forward to next year and cannot wait to share more stories and information with my colleagues.",,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7YZ2MFP
