Leah, my 4 year old, began pre-school. I was already a nervous wreck, because she and I had to get up early to go see my oldest daughter do her ""Senior Walk"", where all of the seniors walk into school on the first day behind their principal and all of us parents are on the sides cheering and yelling and crying and it is over in 5 minutes.  I was worried about Leah having to get up early and us driving to the high school, finding a parking spot and then getting back to her school and having her into her classroom on time. We had no problem getting back to her school in time. My plan was to park and walk my little girl to her class, but on the car ride over, she declared that she wanted to be dropped off and walk into the school by herself, because she was a big girl. I was sad. When we got to her school, and I pulled into the car rider ramp, she was greeted by her sisters' old teachers with big hugs and they walked her into the building. I cried, I cried ugly tears. She did it with such confidence and sure of herself and the kindness shown by the other teachers reassured me that she was going to be okay. She is my miracle baby and for 4 years, I have had her to myself while everyone else is at school and work. It has been she and I running errands and going to the park and Disney Channel on all day. Now, I come home to an empty house and I miss her. I miss having her eat lunch with me and I walked into the mall without her and felt like someone was going to ask me for id when I walked into the kids section of a store. I didn't get begged to go into Build a Bear or get a Frappucino from Starbucks and have to wait for her to jump on all of the squares in the tile flooring. She is adjusting well to her new school schedule and I have time to watch stupid shows like 90 Day Fiance. I guess I will make it, it will be starting all over with her, and I am scared, but she thinks she is ready, and that is more of what matters.",38JBBYETQPWV8MS0ULL6YJR7Z5RE4O,38JBBYETQPWV8MS0ULL6YJR7Z5RE4O
