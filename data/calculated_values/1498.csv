It was around christmas time so normally we are at home unwrapping gifts and things of that nature. This year we decided to do something a little bit different. we thought going on a road trip would be something of interest. So that is what we decided to do during the holidays. Only thing is we didn't know where we wanted to go during our road trip. So we ended up going to a random city that wasn't over 4 hours from our home. The place we decided to go was unexpected we didn't know much at all about the city. we ended up stopping in a town we have never heard or seen before. It turned out to be a lot to do in this town. we liked it so much that we stayed for the holiday and overnight as well. It was a very random experience. Neither of us knew what to expect from the situation. The town and the people in it were cool enought to make us stay longer than we expected. Overall it was a great little holiday.,,38JBBYETQPWV8MS0ULL6YJR7Z6OE4N
