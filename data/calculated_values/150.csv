It was both good and bad. I always knew that she had a weird father. A bit controlling. Perhaps his military discipline at play? I am not really sure. I got to see it full force when i went to visit mary around 6 months back. Right after i entered, i saw her dad. He was surprisingly old, with grey hair. He was always young and strong in my memories of him. We exchanged pleasantries. I was actually looking forward to help Mary in the kitchen. However, her dad insisted on joining him for drinks and watching the game in the TV. I couldn't refuse, of course. The day was definitely saved by Mary's delicious Italian diner.",,3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RAD3NE5JS
