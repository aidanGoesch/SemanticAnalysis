It made sense after the fact, since it is income. And the IRS can take almost all income you get. I should have known. I had previous years that I didn't declare too. But going back over the forms and figured it out. I paid the back-taxes. I four years to go back over. I was able to do it in installments. Overall it wasn't that big of a deal too. I was glad I could get installments to do it. It helped me so I could actually repay the taxes. The installments made it easy in a way. I should have known that the patreon income would be taxed. I just felt it was different in some way.",,38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAB4YLI4
