So I assumed I didn't have to worry about taxes on it. But as time wore on and the amount of the income increased, I began to worry. It was becoming the majority of my income. And eventually I quit my wage job and it became my main source of income. So I continued to worry that it was taxable. As I researched it, in 2018 it seemed more and more likely that it was taxable. I was worried about the amount of past income I might owe back taxes on. So I went to a tax accountant in early 2019. It turned out that I owed about 6k in back taxes for the previous four years. It was fairly easy to make monthly installment arrangements that I could afford. And my monthly income was within the personal exemption amount. This meant I only had to pay 15% self-employment tax. So my worst fears weren't realized. I could survive the payments I had to make.",38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAB4YLI4,
