But all of these are not equally important, enjoyable and memorable. All days we come across in our life are not the same. Some are memorable. It happened few months ago. I was walking towards the bus stand at that time an old woman called me and asked me ""can you gave me two rupees"". She was looking so tired and weak. I became really sad by hearing that question actually I didn't have much money in my hand then. I gave her twenty rupees. she said no I want only two rupees. I said its okay and walked away..I thank GOD for giving me an opportunity to help her. Please don't ask for much GOD knows everything that we want ,He will gave us everything. I have great passion towards dancing and so in the final year of my college I decided to finally live my dreams and form my own dance group which will be performing in the Annual Fest. Everything was going perfect,I had a perfect cooperative and loving group and we were all set to burn the floors on Fest. Just before 5 days of the fest,a member of the union came up and said now bhaji  has decided that since its your last fest you should go for it and your team can perform. Heart said that after all the disrespect that you have got you shouldn't step on the stage again but mind said it's time for your actions to speak. San Francisco is beautiful and just fantastic, albeit expensive. There is something for everyone there. If you like boutique hotels, they are there. If you like the fancy hotels like the Sir Francis Drake, that is also available in abundance",,3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RAD3NE5JS
