I thought it as a duck at first, so I didn't pay much attention, except that maybe I would move it after unloading my groceries so that it didn't get run over by someone else parking at the store. I put all my stuff in the back of my trunk and got in my car. All of sudden, I remembered about the baby duck, turned the car off, and got out to go move it to a spot farther away in the parking lot, closer to the canal on the west side of the grocery store. I was shocked it see it was not a duck, but rather, a baby kitten covered in ants! I grabbed a Gatorade bottle that I had just bought and in a panic dumped it on top of the kitten to wash off some of the ants. The kitten didn't have his eyes open and was crying loudly at this point. A person in the parking lot saw what was going on and ran over with some paper towels that were in her car. Neither of us could find a mom cat or any other kittens. I held the baby close and kept picking off ants. They weren't biting me, so at least I knew they weren't fire ants, but there were thousands of them crawling over my arms and stomach, as well as on the baby kitten. I decided the only thing I could do was wrap the kitten in an extra shirt in my car, put it on my lap and bring it home. I have bottle feeding experience and knew I needed to feed him right away. Shelters will euthanize a kitten that cannot feed itself. Asking for help from a rescue group in my area is pointless. I knew no one else would help this kitten, so I did the right thing and brought him to my house. I was afraid to bathe him at such a young age, but I had to get the rest of the ants and Gatorade off of him if he was going tot have a chance at survival. I stayed up all night feeding him goat's milk from a syringe every two hours. I kept him warm by placing a sock filled with uncooked rice that I heated in the microwave every 30 minutes or so. It was a long night, but he survived! I was so happy!",38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAEMIILO,38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAEMIILO
