It has been 3 months since I had gall stones wreaking havoc on my insides. I woke up with just an overall pain and couldnt figure out what it was. I took some antacid and a tylenol and went about the day. After I woke up feeling the same way the next day I went into the doctors office. Next was a blur as it all happened so fast. I was told I would need to be sedated for and emergency surgery. I was shocked, worried, and confused, but agreed and then i was out like a light. When I came to i was greeted by my family and my neighbors who were all very concerned. I had considered not even going to the doctor that day and Had i not they said it is likely I would have been dead. I am so thankful for the staff at Mercy hospital for taking care of me and doing what needed to get done. I have a new lease on life now as I know any day could be the last one. And I have been urging my friends and family to go get checked out if they are not feeling great. I may be over doing it on the warnings but I think it is important. And as an added bonus, now I know where a gallbladder is and what it does!",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL20WW61
