The trip to crater lake was in the summer where I didn't have any obligations for work because I took a full week off. It was such an awesome unforgettable experience. At first when we arrived, many hiking trails were closed so it made us a bit sad but there were still that were open. It was a breath taking view looking at the crater lake once we finished the 30 minute hike. Once we came to the lodge, we enjoyed some wine. The wine we drank was chardonnay and it suited with the environment. We also enjoyed the sunrise and sunset. We were fortunate to have the lodge booked. Normally the lodge gets booked super quickly. We booked about 5 months in advance which was a smart move. I hope to come back again. Next time I want a bigger car because the car was a bit small. I still remember the views every day. I think this writing experience was valuable to me because it allowed me to reflect on myself and cherish the memories. Nowadays with so much social media and busy life it's hard to revisit things and writing was a great form of self reflection.",38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL32A6WU,
