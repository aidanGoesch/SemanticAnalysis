It was particularly special because it was me and my girlfriend's 1 year anniversary. We stayed at the Crater Lake Lodge which is normally a very hard venue to reserve. However, my girlfriend was very prompt and smart about reserving the space very early on which allowed us to stay at the lodge. To our surprise we noticed there was snow amid the hot sun. The crater lake was a unforgettable view and it was breathtaking. It is so hard to describe the emotions that we both felt. During the whole day we drank a lot of wine to keep ourselves warm and with the slight booze it helped us rather excited throughout the day. We went on a couple of hikes throughout the day. One thing that was in our bucket list was to do the jumping to the lake but that never ended up happening. This was because the roads were closed because there were some cracks and boulders that needed to be removed. In the evening the lodge was very cozy. However, with such a beautiful view of the sky we ended up chit chatting until 3AM. Our next day was planned to go to Portland and yes we were exhausted but we didnâ€™t really mind. This trip really got us thinking about developing our relationship and thus it was truly unforgettable for both of us. I hope to go again on another time and stay at the lounge with the lake view. That was the only downside because it was hard to reserve a spot and we had to stay in the mountain view. All in all I hope to revisit my memory in the future.",38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL32A6WU,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL32A6WU
