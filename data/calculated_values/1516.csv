I came face-to-face with how I was truly missing out on life, on what matters most.  Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now.  The day started like any other day.  I mindlessly went through my routine, made sure my spouse was ready for work, and dropped my kid off at school.  Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.  Like normal, I just did my job, made some money, ran errands, cleaned the house, and started some things for dinner.  I had coffee with my friend, chatting about our many responsibilities and how grateful we were for any breaks from spending time with others, how heavy our workloads were and how school gave us a little break in our day from childcare. That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school.  I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school.  There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway.  I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it.  She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.  The kids were killed in that horrible accident.  My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.  She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy.  I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night.  I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?  Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?  Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?  I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list.  All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by.  I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life.  Each day is precious:  I will remember and truly learn to live.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB
