You just wake up each day and go through the same routine as though you're on auto pilot. You wake the kids, walk the dog and go to work then the next thing you know the work day is over then it's back home to get ready for bed and start the cycle all over again. Days turn into weeks and weeks into months and you wonder where the time went while waiting to reach this destination of happiness you've been longing to find for as long as you can remember. Recently, in one of those brief moments of wonder and longing I did more than reminisce over time and it's elusive passing. I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left. I keep waiting for this happiness like it's a destination when I had to remind myself that being happy is a mood. Sometimes it's brief and sometimes it's replaced by sadness, bitterness, or anger. I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live. I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. After I actually done this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had planned to retire from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live. This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.",38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB
