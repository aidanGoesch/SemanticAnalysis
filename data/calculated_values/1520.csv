I have a son, he is 30 years old. He got married at 17, and I have a granddaughter, she is 11, and a grandson, he is 2. Both are part Jewish. My son`s dad was Jewish, from Poland, but born in New York in 1966. He died of a brain tumor. My son, looks fine, but the kids were born with a brain`s cyst. Both had had a brain surgery to help them, but the cysts (both), are still there. These cysts are affecting their lives, they have to be going to see the Doctor and be checking them. Just a week ago, my little grandson had a surgery again, I went to visit him to the Hospital, and he was looking so delicate, so blue, very, very pale. I am so worried about them, but other than that, when the cysts are not acting, they are healthy, normal, very, very intelligent, I would say that they are geniouses. Really, really smart. And happy. I just love them. They don`t live with me, but they come visit. I love to play with my grandson, he is the one that plays with me. Last night, we were playing, and I showed to him a chess box. We placed all the pieces in the board and we had fun with them. I am so happy he is doing well. He has to wear a helmet because his skull is so thin that one fall could be fatal. But in the last check up, the Dr. said his skull is getting better. Perhaps one day he will be able to be without the helmet. Right now, just seeing them alive is a miracle.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILCWTW60
