When our son, Jackson, started preschool, notes and telephone calls from his teachers regarding his inattentiveness began almost immediately.  He had difficulty sitting still during circle time and couldn't keep his hands and feet to himself.  He often started an activity, scribbled something on a piece of paper, and then would walk off to begin another activity. He couldn't concentrate long enough to finish his work.  This pattern of behavior followed him to elementary school where the classes were larger and the interruptions and misbehavior had bigger implications.  My husband and I had always recognized that Jackson had difficulties keeping himself occupied at home.  We eventually stopped attending church because his disruptiveness during the service was embarrassing. He'd crawl under the pews, roll around on the floor, and would often yawn loudly during sermons.  Despite our best efforts to discipline him, set boundaries, and accommodate his misbehavior, we felt like we were failing him.  Eventually, when he turned seven, we took him to his pediatrician, and she immediately diagnosed him with ADHD.  We felt a sense of relief that we had professional confirmation.  That was four months ago, and my husband and I are still grappling with both his diagnosis and whether or not to medicate him.  I've talked with several friends and family members who either have ADHD themselves or parent a child with the disorder.  The parents almost unanimously sing the praises of medication, claiming that the positive effects completely outweigh the negative effects such as lack of appetite.  However, the feedback from those who have ADHD and have taken medication has been somewhat of a mixed bag.  Some have told us about the depression that seems to appear once the medication regime has begun.  Others claim that lack of appetite is by far the worst side effect.  They all have conceded that they are more focused, able to complete work or activities, and feel like they are able to fit in with peers during events.  My husband and I remain undecided as to whether or not we want Jackson to take medication that might help him succeed in school, but would come at a price.  Do the benefits outweigh the costs, and are we willing to gamble with our son's brain and mental state in order for him to ""fit in?""  How will he live his life with this label of ADHD?",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILCWVW62
