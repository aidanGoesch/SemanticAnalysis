Four months ago, after several years of realizing he's a bit 'different' than most other children his age, the testing finally confirmed his ADHD. Am I surprised by this? No. Am I happy? Yes and no. Yes I'm happy that we have a diagnosis that seems consistent with what we know about the disorder. No I""m not happy that he is a child with ADHD. But, now he's treating his issue with medication. Unfortunately, we've gone through two different medications and have not found the right one for him. The first one has led to a weight loss that was not safe so he had to get off of it. The second one only partly seems to be working - there are still many, many issues that need addressing. We are continuing to meet with his doctor and to do everything we can do to help this child. This is a very emotional situation for my wife and me as for awhile we thought we had a trouble maker in our home but now we realize we have a child with an actual disorder. Our love is endless for this child, we just want him to be able to get on with his life in the most normal way possible.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILCWVW62
