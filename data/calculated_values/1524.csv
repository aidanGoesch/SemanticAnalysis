I played the game a lot as a kid, but have not for several years. There had been a recent meta shift with the release of a new set, so I figured now would be a good time. I watched some of the arena streamers to get an idea of what was good now. I ended up settling on Bant Lands. It seemed the most reliable and is a lot of fun to play, even if it is a bit degenerate to the format. That said I went to my local FNM to play last weekend. It was a bit rough getting back into the hang of things. Its also the first time I had gone to one by myself instead of playing with a group of friends. I ended up coming in second out of a group of about 12. The last guy that I played was running a slightly different version then the one that I have. It was a close match, so I cant be to upset on losing. Its nice to be back into one of the hobbies that I used to play. Im hoping to be able to make it a regular thing. Prices seems to have come back down some, so I would be glad to play again.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILCXHW6Q
