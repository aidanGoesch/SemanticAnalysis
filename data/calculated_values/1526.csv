I'd never used any dating apps before and all my relationships had come from jobs I worked. The initial reaction from Tinder was a rush of excitement and almost adrenaline like. I chatted with various people. I ended up having to cut it off with someone because they seemed far too odd, I got ghosted, I met up with a much older person than me and we ended up being friends, most chats went nowhere. One Sunday morning right before I planned to delete the app I took a look at all of the people who had swiped on me, figuring ""what's the point?"" I saw a 21 year old girl who was a student at the university a work at (I was 24). She was pretty but I couldn't tell much her bio other than her major and that she was a tour guide. A couple hours later I get a message, ""you may have a baby face, but it's adorable. What are you up to today?"" We seemed to have a lot in common, especially since we both knew the university and area well. I could tell even through text she was someone. We hammer out the details, she's no more than 7 minutes from me in an apartment complex. I get there around 7pm and head up to the apartment and I'm very nervous. I'm pretty introverted so meeting people like this is not my thing. She opens the door for me and looks like her profile. We talked for awhile introducing ourselves and decide on a movie. The stream was having buffering issues so Deadpool turned into a 4 hour movie. But I was glad the movie kept pausing, because we talked a ton and I knew there was something about her that made me feel comfortable and at ease. About 5 minutes into the movie she slides across the couch and goes ""excuse me"" and bumps into me. I still laugh about that to this day. For the rest of the movie we cuddled, adjusting so that we were laying down. It was a great time overall, and after that we cuddled for a bit. Fast forward to 7 and I have to go to work. I've been at her place for 12 hours and never slept. From this point on, we're constantly seeing each-other, I realize I love this woman and she feels the same way. Fast forward to present time and she is currently my fiancee and I have never been happier, all from a random Tinder date.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILSP56WO
