We had previously meet at a groceries stores where he assisted with a basket. we got talking and we exchange phone digits. I got a call from Tom and we got chatting. May 27, which was children day holiday, Tom told me we need to see a movie..   Toy Story Four, i screamed for joy, not only for the movie but that i will be with him,  That is our first date and outing.   We bought a big pack of popcorn and two can drinks.   As we sat watching the movie, at around 30 minutes into the movie, we held hands and kept steering at which others faces. only for an elderly woman showed up and gave Tom a like, he looked shocked, so i asked, Tom introduced his mom to me and i was shy, so shy. i felt unease meeting her in such a way.  but it ended up being a great day. because she eventually loved me so much. Before the movie ended Tom's mom had cooked a fantastic dinner, As we sat at the table to eat, we gist about the movie, about our family and what we want in life. After dinner, He led me to the pavilion and we sat down to talk. Don't be surprised. ""he kissed me""In a good way i love the way the day ended.  as Toms mom loved me",,3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDJAJP2O
