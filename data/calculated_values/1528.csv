We went to see the movie Toy Story Four by ourselves. He is sixteen years old and I am fifteen. Anyway, we were both very excited because it was our first official date away from any adult supervision. We had just settled down in our seats with popcorn and a drink when the movie started. As soon as we started holding hands and the lights went low, we saw his mother watching us from across the theater! She wouldn't take her eyes off of us and it made the situation very awkward. We wanted to have some alone time where we could make out and enjoy the movie but his mom knew that we were planning this. She really doesn't like me and doesn't want me to take away her 'baby boy' from her. She wants to maintain his innocence. After she realized that we knew she was there, she came over and sat by us. The entire time she kept staring. We had to stop holding hands and both of us started sweating and became very nervous. Afterwards my boyfriend kept apologizing for his mother just showing up. Now we have to wait until we are both eighteen years old before we can go on a date again.",,3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDJAJP2O
