We stayed over 2 days to vacation. Due to our past, some conversations got very uncomfortable, to the point where we weren’t talking at times. It has put a strain on us being cordial, which hasn’t stopped since the trip. We’ve been friends over 10 years, but it seems to me that it’s over now. We talk at work as needed, but not much beyond that. I really wish it was resolveable, but I don’t think it is. She seems to be taking it better than I am, so at least one of us is relatively unscathed by it all. One hurt is bad enough, 2 is horrible. I would love a chance to go back and fix it, but that’s only wishful thinking. She’s gone her way. I’m stuck in my old ways. I can’t see it improving. It’s a mistake that will hurt forever.  If she’s happy though, I can work on feeling better.",39DD6S19JQXBBJGPFEBWSF4G01LEZT,
