It was a bit of a surprise party. My husband and family made it happen. I was glad they did. It was exciting and we had a lot of fun. They showered me with a lot of gifts. They loved making me happy that day. They know I like surprises, and they delivered. I was very happy. I wish every birthday would be as exciting as that one. I hope next year i can have something exciting like that too. I spent the next day opening up my gifts. I was so happy to see all of the nice things they bought. I particularly loved my first son's gift. It was beautiful and thoughtful.",,39DD6S19JQXBBJGPFEBWSF4GR6MZEG
