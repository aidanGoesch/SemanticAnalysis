Not just because I have more time to myself, but I love seeing my little boy grow up and go through the same stuff that I did. My son was actually very much looking forward to school and that made this day much more enjoyable for me. He woke ME up in the morning, dressed in his new school clothes and he had his backpack on. He was ready to go 2 hours early. I was so proud of him. His friends had come over earlier and some of them wanted to stay home longer for Summer, but not my boy. I made him his favorite breakfast and we talked about what he was hoping would happen that day. I wanted to make it a memorable day for him so he'd look back on it when he's older. After we talked, we got in the car and talked more. He kept asking me about how my first day was. I forget, of course, but I told him what I remembered about what my first day of high school was like. He asked about my first grade teacher and whether or not she would be mean. That was his only worry. He made sure he had all his favorite foods, which I made for him, in his bag, and then got out. He ran inside. It was a fun morning that I will always remember.",,39DD6S19JQXBBJGPFEBWSF4GYJMEZS
