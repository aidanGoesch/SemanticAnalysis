The dog died by my other dog. The other dog was crying. I hugged the other dog and we both shared a cry. I remember the good times with my dog. I remember going to the park. I threw the ball towards the soccer field. The dog got a soccer ball one time by mistake. I had to kick it back to the players. I remember he loved eating peanut butter. I would sometimes put some on his dog food. He loved it but he had to drink water afterwards. It was funny seeing him smack. This was a great time. The dog had a great life. I hope he is resting in dog heaven. He was a good boy.",,39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZD1VX
