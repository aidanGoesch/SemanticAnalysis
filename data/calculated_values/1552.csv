We got her in 2005 and she had been diagnosed with heart trouble. As we called her back in, she turned and looked at my mother then ran off into the dark. We waited and waited for them to come back and when we heard our little mini-pin cry out,I had a horrible feeling. I stepped onto the lawn and noticed Buttons lying in her favorite spot with Sparky at her side. She had laid down where she loved and quietly passed away. I picked her up and felt her limpness and I knew she was gone. It was such a horrible feeling. She was our last link to the old life we had when my father was alive. He had loved her so much and the last thing he told us was to take care of her. Buttons was with me when I went through cancerand his loss. She was with me throughout the last fourteen years and I loved her so much. I think that losing her has had a profound effect on me because in some way it was the end of an era. It was the end of the life in Idaho living on a farm. It was the end of days and days of her waiting for me. I think that the day we took her to be cremated was one of the most painful days. Even now, I still cry about it. I guess the comfort I feel is that she died on a beautiful night, in her favorite spot next to Sparky and that was a really nice way to go. I miss her so much but I have to let her go.",39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZD1VX,39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZD1VX
