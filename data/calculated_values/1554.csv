I began to focus solely on myself and not to reach out to him. When I would see him in public, I would often ignore him. This seemed to ignite ""the chase"" again. Not that I wanted that, I wanted to heal and move on. But life is funny... and I recall recieving a very emotional phone call from my ex boyfriend. He asked if i hated him. He apologized for becoming distant. His actions really aligned with his words when he began to spend a lot of time with me and courting me even better than before when we first met. We bang to spend every weekend together, we've spent Christmas eve, my 26th birthday and the new year together. HE confides in me much more now. I have not changed but he clearly has, and if i can not honor his words i can certainly honor his actions as of late. So, to reflect on the past - he is no longer my ex boyfriend. Do I miss him? Whenever he is not around, yes. & that is not very often these days. I'm grateful for the change that time can manifest in people and relationships. I did nothing to bring this about but I am so grateful to have my love reciprocated and to feel the effort from him that I have not felt from him before or from any other man.",39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZE1VY,
