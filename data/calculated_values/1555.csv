There is a bar i would frequent often and would see him, sometimes he would buy me drinks, but my focus was not on dating. Eventually, we grew close and everytime I went to the bar he would meet me there. it was always a great time. As most women do, i fell in love first. It was hard to not to when I was spending every night and morning with him. I knew things were meant to be casual, but couldn't help how I started to feel. He began to cancel on me often and given other subtle signs that his feet were getting cold. I chose to ghost him in an effort to protect myself and my heart, but I still miss and long for him so much. As time  goes on, it gets easier. However. he will always have a place in my memory and my heart. I believe that he was a lesson. A lesson that love is often unexpected. A lesson also, that love can be even  better than what we experience. While I enjoyed many qualities about him, I also know that I will not tolerate some things ever again as a result of our intense but short relationship.",39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZE1VY,39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QLZE1VY
