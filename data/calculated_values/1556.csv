My wife had a maternity leave and is yet to resume. I made sure my own 12 days leave coincided with the particular time my wife had her maternity leave. So three weeks ago, after some days planning, we set on this picnic to the park. It was the first we had since we gave birth to our youngest son about 6 weeks earlier. I took my ford, stocked it with drinks and some food in the warmer and we set out. With me is my wife and our 3 sons. This park is a popular park and it's only a 2 hours drive from our apartment. By 7 am, we were already on our way. I stepped on the gas such that my wife had to caution me not to kill us. We blasted our favorite song ""Shakira - Try Everything"" and my eldest son with his brother were bouncing on the back seat. Our youngest son was suckling on the breast of his mother like his life depended on it. In no time, we were at the park. We packed our stuffs and headed for a cool spot. We took a walk around while my wife and I were talking about our last visit here before kids starting coming into our lives. We helped ourselves to the food in the warmer while I set music to the portable I brought along. We spent some 3 hours singing, dancing, eating, taking a walk and playing family games. When we were satisfied, we took our leave. All our sons slept on the way back. I guess it because they had an enjoyable time.",,39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QMTWV1Z
