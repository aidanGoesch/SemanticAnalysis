I went on vacation this summer to NYC. I have always wanted to travel to New York. I have had dreams of going there since I was a little kid. I majored in finance in college so to be able to see the biggest financial district in the world was incredible. I went on a tour of wall street and took a picture with the infamous bull. There are so many things to do in NYC and my best friend and I made the most of our time. We went on a ferry ride to go see the Statue of Liberty. We went and saw the memorial for the twin towers. One of my favorite moments was when we went to a rooftop bar and was hanging out with a perfect view of the sky-line. The only negative thing about NYC is the prices. It was like $15 for a cocktail, I knew it would be expensive there but it was crazy. Another plus about the city is that there is world-class dining pretty much everywhere you go. You could eat world-class dining or you could get a hot dog from a cart and either way the food was delicious. If it wasn't so expensive to live there I would definitely want to move, the city life is for me.",,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4Z5FT4JA
