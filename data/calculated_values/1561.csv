I was thinking I could make everyone happy by doing what I thought my brother would want me to do with his ashes, but my brother's ashes were stolen from my car. My family and I was dealing with a lot of sadness from the unexpected passing of my brother, I turned to alcohol. I had been drinking the day I decided to release my brother's ashes in the river, and my car was broken into. My family was very upset with me and didn't want me around, things got better but were never the same because of my actions. I recently found my brother ashes were taken by a kid in the neighborhood who thought it was something valuable in the box I placed it in. The kid is a teenager now and thought about what he did as a child after. The young man buried it in his backyard after realizing what it was, and the trouble he would be in. He bought it to me yesterday and explained, I can't believe it's been 5 years because I think about it everyday. I was excited to let my family know I found my brother's ashes, we all celebrated and decided we would do better with forgiving each other. Me and my family will be going on a vacation together next summer, they decided it would be a good idea to release my brother's ashes were we use to fish at in the summer. I'm surprised but it makes sense to everyone, I'm looking forward to the family vacation. I've been able to forgive myself after knowing everyone forgave me. I really learned a lot about myself and my family through the rough times. I have my drinking problem under control and everyone seems happy for me.",,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4Z5FV4JC
