At the time, he was separated from his wife and heading for divorce. She agreed to take care of him and my brother gave her power of attorney. He donated his body to science and was then cremated. His ashes were sent to wife. She refused to give them back to family even though she was engaged and living with fiance. She was killed in a car wreck within the year and after that we lost touch with where his ashes were. I tried through the years to contact family members to no avail. One day, after 5 years of trying I started thinking about it all again and decided I would give in one more try. I looked up law regarding this issue and found out that law states his remains are to go to next of kin, which is his parents. We lost both or parents. If parents are gone they go to siblings. I am the oldest sibling and then decided I would bluff my way through this so I found her sister on Facebook and contacted her. She read my message and didn't respond, so I bluffed my way with what I had found out and told sister she had 10 days to respond to my message or I would sue to get him back. It worked. She said her mother had them and gave me her phone number. I called her mother and she agreed to give them back. I immediately sent my nephew over them to claim his ashes. As soon as he got them he mailed them to me here in Missouri. I am now going to Texas (my home state) in 3 weeks and are finally burying him next to our other brother that we lost within 2 years of youngest death. They were together in life and deserve to be together in death.",,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4Z5FV4JC
