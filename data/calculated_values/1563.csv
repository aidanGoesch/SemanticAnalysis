My father had been struggling with cancer, and my mother was obviously in despair about this.  It was a rough time for all of us, especially because money was tight with the cost of medication.  I tried to help as often as I could.  One night, some people broke into my parents home and stole money - WHILE my dad was on his deathbed.  I found out later that they were drug dealers coming to collect money that my parents owed them.  Dad had been using marijuana and other drugs to make himself more comfortable while he died slowly.  Its not something I would normally approved of, but I did understand in this circumstance. The hospital would offer no help unless he was admitted - in which case they could offer morphine for the pain.  But, the hospital stay was incredibly costly and the insurance only covered a portion of it, so it was actually cheaper to use the drug dealers....or so they thought.  I gave my mom some money to help get by until their next pension payments came in.   Mom needed to get dad some more morphine from the dealers, and this time, the upped the price.  When my mom refused to pay the additional money to them, they snatched her purse and stole all the cash she had brought with her, AND didn't even give her anything in return.  I felt horrible to watch my parents suffer through this, let alone to have to deal with it while dad was in such dire straits.  I felt useless and helpless - I still do.  I remember telling my mom that I couldn't give her anymore money to be robbed or wasted, but she refused to tell me where to obtain the drugs so I could deal with it, but she refused to tell me who they were out of fear.  I wondered how they knew where she lived!  I told her that after dad passes that she should move in with my husband and I.  Dad went shortly after, and mom moved in with me.  Drug dealers have earned a special place on my hit list.",,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUFLJ46
