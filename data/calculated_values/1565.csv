He was diagnosed with lung cancer. When I found out I was devestated because I know that cancer equals death. I started crying immediately when I found out. I called my sister still in tears. I told her ""dad has cancer"" and she said ""what does that mean?"" I was so mad I hung up and went away to be alone for a while. I wanted to be anywhere but there. I would rather be in prison and learn about it in a letter than witness it happen. My father scheduled a surgery in hopes that they could remove the cancer. My father had surgery but it was unsucessful. A drug addict by the name of Jamie went into my moms purse and stole all of her money. I was so mad, but I could not do anything about it because my dad needed me. I gave my mom some more money so that I could get back to taking care of my father. Then Jamie and her homeless boyfriend Doug did it again. This time they took my mom's whole wallet. I still could not leave because my father needed my help. My dad wasted away and was unable to eat. I would cry myself to sleep every night. My father passed away while the hospice nurse was at his house. She came to the bedroom to tell me he had passed. I did not want to see my dad dead because I wanted to remember him alive. I was now free to catch Jamie and Doug and make them pay for robbing my father while he was on his deathbed. They will probably be somewhere getting high when I catch them. I cannot wait to catch them. It would be a dream come true to catch both of them together. I've tried everything imaginable to let it go",39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUFLJ46,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUFLJ46
