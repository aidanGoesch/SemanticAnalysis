We had been talking for quite some time and we've been friends for about 4 years. We both felt like we were incredibly committed to each other and wanted to take a chance on being with each other. I remember it being very hard to get everything in order for me to move. I had to find money in between the bills and responsibilities I had in order to be able to fund moving. I had lots of things that I needed to mail and I also had to get money for plane tickets. I think it was really stressful even finding bookings as the holiday season was not too far around the corner and DIA is already an exceptionally busy airport. I remember being worried to let my roommate know that I would be moving as we both worked together and were pretty much best friends. I knew they would be upset about it, as they tend to get upset about things before eventually coming to understanding that things are going to be the way they are. Once I had finally gotten most of the finances I needed to, I eventually told my roommate my plans and reasons to move. It was very exciting but I was also getting more and more anxious the closer the date of my flight came. On that day I had all my things packed up, ready to mail and my luggage for my flight ready. I called an Uber to take me to the UPS store so I could mail the packages I wouldn't be taking on the flight. Then I took a second Uber downtown to the train station. I would then take a train to the airport. I arrived about 3-4 hours early so that I'd have time to get past TSA and grab some food and try my best to relax. I'm terrified of flying so I was really nervous. Our flight got delayed by about an hour because the weather was really bad. We finally got on the plane and I immediately ordered drinks from the flight attendant when she came by. I needed something to relax me. I finally landed in Houston around midnight that night. I met my girlfriend at the baggage claim and we were so excited to finally be together. A year later, I realize taking this chance was one of the best decisions I've ever made.",3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RADUBGJ5B,
