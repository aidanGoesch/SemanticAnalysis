I drove with my family from Virginia all the way to Islamorada which took a total time of more than 16 hours over two days.  We stayed in the Keys for five days before returning home. The trip did not start out well. The weather was rainy when we first left Virginia and temperatures were cool. The traffic trying to go south out of the state was terrible. The drive after that point wasn't too bad, just very long. We stopped the first night when we got to the Ocala area. We didn't have reservations for a hotel, so we had to end up staying in a shady motel. The area itself was fine but the room was old and run-down looking. The shower didn't have any hot water and we found multiple bugs in the room. Thankfully we only had to stay one night before continuing to drive to the Keys. The next day we finally got down to the Keys. One of my most memorable moments was going over one of the first bridges. There were some rain showers around, but the sun was shining and the water was a beautiful, bright turquoise color. The hotel we had booked was much better than the motel we had stayed in and even had a small beach at it. We spent most of our time checking out the local beaches and going snorkeling on the jetties and reefs in the area.  All in all, I really enjoyed my time in the Florida Keys and the time I got to spend with my family. I would definitely recommend the area to others who are thinking of visiting.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVY00T8VP
