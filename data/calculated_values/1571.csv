Two months flew by like it was nothing. Like a blink of an eye. It's been 2 months now, since i married Lilly. I knew right away when i saw her crossing my class in high school, that this was the girl that i would marry someday. Thank god, it was her. The one and only love of my life. I couldn't be more grateful and happier in life. I married the most wonderful person on the planet. She proves it time and again. I was quite surprised when suggested we just register the marriage at city council, to not have a big party or anything. She wanted to donate all that money for charity. I am proud of her. Yes, it was a small marriage. But i wouldn't change anything about that day.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVY0Z28VW
