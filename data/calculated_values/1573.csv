Two months ago, I noticed a beautiful 4k television at a local store. I knew the moment I saw it, I must buy it. The great thing was the price. The store was offering huge discounts just before Thanksgiving. I bought the television and received a three hundred dollar discount. The day of the delivery, I was full of anticipation. I reconfigured my living room in order to make the space for my  prized purchase. It took approximately sixty minutes to unbox and set up the television. Immediately after it arrived, I called friends and family members to schedule a football watching party for the following Sunday. The day of the party was so exciting. Over twenty people came over to watch football and movies on my new television. Every one was amazed by the sound and video quality of the new television. The football field, players and referees were so vivid. It was just like being at the football stadium. Everyone asked, where I bought the television and how much it costs. No one believed that I received such a great discount on the television. The television helped to provide me with one of the most memorable and sociable weekends in a long time.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYBIGV8A
