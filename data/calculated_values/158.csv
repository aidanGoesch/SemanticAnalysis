It was overall a very nerve wracking experience and I was very unsure how everything would play out. Suffice to say, I was taking a big risk. I think that it was a really difficult thing to do, but I wanted to do it because it was something I believed in. I was nervous the entire time. I took an uber to the train station in Downtown Denver and then the train to the airport. I was several hours early, but I had to wait forever because there were so many people flying that day. It took about 2 hours to get through TSA and to my terminal. I then tried everything I could to stay calm until my plane. It was delayed by a couple of hours and we didn't end up flying until around 9PM. I landed at 11AM, and was ecstatic to see my girlfriend. We got my luggage and left. I felt like the journey was finally over and I'm glad I made the decision I did. We drove to her house and on the way got Whataburger, which was delicious. I had never had it before.",3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RADUBGJ5B,3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RADUBGJ5B
