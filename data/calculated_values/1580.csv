We spent some time in the Dolomite mountains in northern Italy, based in the resort town of Cortina. We did some hiking while there, and while all the hikes were spectacular there was one particular one that still sticks with me. I knew that it was a tough hike, and added to that was the fact that part of it was going up a small waterfall aided by cables that were left over from world war I. My wife is a bit scared of heights, and she is also somewhat unconfident in her abilities even though she is quite athletic. I did what I suppose is a bad thing, and failed to mention the part about the cables when I was describing the hike for her. I knew that she would be able to do it, but also knew that she would refuse if I told her about it ahead of time. I know, I'm a bad person. Anyways, the hike began with a long and steep ascent up a mountain. As we neared the top (or so we kept thinking), the footing became more and more difficult as it was just loose rock, and we would slide down a bit with every step. Then we kept approaching what we thought and hoped were the crest of the mountain but to our dismay it never was. There was always more climbing on the other side. I was getting worried that my wife was going to quit, because to be honest this part of the hike was not all that scenic since we were just on the side of a mountain looking into it. Behind us was very pretty but we were not looking that way. Finally we came to another crest and we expected once again to be faced with another part of the mountain on the other side. Instead when we reached the top, it really was the top, and in front of us lay the entire Dolomite range for as far as we could see. The tops of the mountains looked like something from Lord of the Rings, all pointy and craggly. I actually got tears in my eyes at the sight. I will never forget that view for as long as I live, and the best part was we were the only ones who were up there. Unfortunately for my wife, next came the small waterfall and cables. I think she was too tired to even be mad at me. I even told her before we started that part that I knew about it but didn't tell her. I went first, and while it was a bit scary it wasn't anything we couldn't handle. My wife scampered up behind me and did a great job. We both say that it was one of the greatest days of our lives.",39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRP28V3,
