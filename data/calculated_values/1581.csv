I had wanted to do this hike for many years and had researched it quite a bit. I knew it was going to be difficult but I had no idea how much so. We started early in the morning and for about four hours we just kept climbing up higher and higher. It was even more difficult because there was loose rocks under us for much of it. Every time we reached what we thought was the top, another long uphill awaited us. Finally after what I figured was another false top, we came up and it was as though we were at the top of the world. There below us spreading for 360 degrees were what seemed like thousands of craggly mountain peaks. It was like something from Lord of the Rings. We both started to cry it was so beautiful. There was more crazy hiking to do, however, as we had to use ropes that had been attached to the mountain during World War I to transverse some cliffs and small waterfalls. That was the most difficult part for my wife, and I was so proud of her that she did it. I think she suprised herself. It was really one of the most memorable experiences of our lives. Even though we pretty much killed ourselves doing it, I think we would both do the same hike again in a heartbeat.",39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRP28V3,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRP28V3
