Some days were better than others. My daily routine was to stand at my favorite spots and ask for money or food. This cannot be my future I keep telling myself. I have to find a way to get out of this. I ignore the shameful looks and mocking insults. I made some bad decisions but it wasn't all my fault. I stay mobile as I can and find shelter on rainy and very hot days. Always keep moving. I try to take advantage of any work or job opportunities but it is hard to find anything that would help. I think I may try and get a janitorial position at a local fast food restaurant. They have been nice to me and have helped me at times with free samples. I just want to work and be able to take care of myself. Nothing makes me happy and I'm on the verge of giving up but I still have this determination to succeed. Tomorrow I will go to my local shelter and find some newer clothes.,,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRYWV82
