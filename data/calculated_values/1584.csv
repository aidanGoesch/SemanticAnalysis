I was homeless. I had to work very hard. I did not have many friends at the time. I had to work hard just to eat. I worked hard to get out of the situation. I did some work online and looked for resources. I got my stuff together. I did my best. I got a job. I got a home. I am glad that I worked hard for it. I did it with some help from friends. I did it with some help of strangers. I got my life together and am happy about it. I ended up having a better life. I did everything that I could at all times and it paid off when I was trying to get my life back together.,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRYWV82,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYRYWV82
