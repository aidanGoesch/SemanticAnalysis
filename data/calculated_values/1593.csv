There was a child in the facility. He had autism. The facility doesn't meet the needs of this child. I complained to management. They changed it. The child is getting the best care now. I hope he has a good life. I decided to get lunch to celebrate the change. I went to a nice steakhouse. I got some onion rings as an appetizer. They were very nice. I got a giant steak as the main meal. It was medium. I got a beer to drink with my steak. They were both to die for. I gave the waitress a big tip. She was very good at serving my meal. I went home to sleep thinking that I did good in this world.",,39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHPW3CVX
