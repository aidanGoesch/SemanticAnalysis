My grades were all well enough to get in and as a matter of a fact I did get widely accepted to many law schools.  I had one major downfall, all the scholarship programs were taken, well all the ones that offer 100% Scholarship. I think it was because I didn't apply early enough and couldn't get a vacant scholarship spot. That's a major problem for me.  I cannot afford to go to Law School, even if I had a full time job I couldn't afford it.  Also, I would have to think about when I would be able to study and do the assigned homework.  I'm very frustrated right now. It has always been my dream to go to law school. I can remember watching all the crime TV shows and trying to predict out comes. I fantasize about being a high level attorney in New York city, with my name posted on the firm its self one day.  Although right now I cannot go because i simply cannot afford to go.  I've worked so hard to get in. Its brings me much pain the money it's the determining factor to taking my first step towards the rest of my life.  I don't think its over by a long shot.  I will just have to apply earlier next yet in hopes of getting a paid scholarship.  Until then, I will keep studying and work as much as I can to earn enough money to be able to carry me through what I believe to be a very rough 4 years.  As hard as I know it will be, it will be worth every penny, late night, every tear shed to live out the dreams that I have. Until next time diary thanks for being my ears.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG0HDAMJ
