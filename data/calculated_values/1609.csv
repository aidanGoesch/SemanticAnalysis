It upset me because I had just had my hours cut a my job and was trying to get caught up on some bills. I really did not have the funds to buy a new tire. So I looked online at how much a new tire would cost and if I could maybe afford a used tire or find a place that would let me make payments. I found an affordable new tire, but they said I would have to pay the 100 dollars up front, and I just did not have it. The mechanic said that they had some used tires that were much cheaper, but I would have to come in and look at them to decide which one to buy. I thanked him and hung up. I then realized I had no way to get to the shop to buy the tire! I then called my good friend, Joe and told him about my situation. He said he would be glad to help and that he would be over in about twenty minutes. I was relieved that he could do it, because if he couldn't I would have to find another way to get there. Twenty minutes passed and he hadn't arrived yet, so I decided to wait a few more minutes before I started to wonder if he was really going to show or not. Right before I was going to call to see where he was at, he came driving down the street and pulled into my driveway. He got out of the car smiling and said ""Sorry, I can't drive you to the shop to buy a new tire..."" I looked at him and frowned and asked him ""Then why did you drive over here?"" we just smiled some more as he walked around to his trunk and opened it. ""Because I already bought you a new tire!"" I just stood there flabbergasted. I could have hugged him. That helped me out terribly. I thanked him profusely and told him I would pay him back when I could and he told me not to worry too much about it, just to remember that I owe him a favor. I am lucky to have such good friends.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1JTMAG
