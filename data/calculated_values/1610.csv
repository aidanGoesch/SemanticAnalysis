I was struggling to keep up on my bills, and was just really going through it. I worked with a very good friend of mine. I had told her about my recent struggles, and she was aware what was going on in my life. I had a flat tire, and I had been driving around on the donut tire for a while. The donut was starting to go flat, and I was always having to pump it up.  I really needed a new tire, and just couldnt afford one. One day at work my friend asked if she could use my car on her lunch break. Her husband had dropped her off that day so she didnt have her car. I told her sure and gave her my keys. She went on her lunch and came and came back. After work that day I walked out to my car. My car had a brand new tire on it! I was really confused at first and then figured it had to have been my friend. I called her and she was laughing, and told it was a birthday gift for me. My birthday was coming up soon. I was so happy and grateful! I appreciated my friends kindness so much. She is an amazing friend to have.",39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1JTMAG,
