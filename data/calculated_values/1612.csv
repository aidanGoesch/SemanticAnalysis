I think on that time she was my spouse and everything in my life. we are in same class and good friends. I proposed to her and she accepted after a couple of days only. After we finished our course and graduation we go for work in same office. we worked very hard for 5 years and we both got promoted. we got married and got 2 kids. we built a new house and lived happily with our kids and parents. But i do know what happened my wife always fighting with me for last few years. Our sex life is dwindled. we both are restless in our life. Our kids are very sad about us. They wanted us to be united together back. We both decided to go for council. we got council and united back with our happy life with kids.,,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1K8MAX
