I thought this was going to be just a family outing. I had NO idea that we were going to be spreading her mother's ashes, who had passed a short time before the trip. I think maybe she didn't want me to say no or be freaked out by the situation. Actually, I had quite the opposite reaction. We had a small ceremony in the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Gardens to honor her memory and her life. The family asked me if I would help out and I was quite moved by that. I haven't ingrained my place in their lives for very long at this point but they wanted to include me in such a meaningful moment. I helped with the releasing of the ashes and had some words to express. I was a little bummed out because I didn't have the chance to get to know my girlfriend's mom very much before she died. I like to think she would be happy that I can be emotional supportive of the family and her daughter. I hope she would approve of me being there. I would do anything for my girlfriend. I was very emotional for the rest of the day but that was to be expected. Hawaii was beautiful, though. I suspect she was looking down on us and making the sun shine the entire trip.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIGAD5AMD
