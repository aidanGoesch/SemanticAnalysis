My second wedding to my most wonderful husband ever.. our 10th anniversary.  Maybe people think I should have waited another 10 years but there are key people in my life I wanted to witness us renew our vows and as morbid it may sound, possibly will not be with us another ten years. Added addition to the ceremony is  our lovely 6 year old daughter who were our flower girl. I bought a simple, yet pretty gown and my husband got a tailored made suit. Our daughter got the prettiest dress ever and we set the date over the winter on the beach in our local city, Miami.  The ceremony was beautiful and my husband and I expressed our love to each other and the blessing,m our daughter we have created. We had a small gathering following the ceremony in our backyard where our guests can mingle. Everyone goes to our home and good food, music, and drinks is  served. The open bar was a hit, maybe too much of it as few of the guests, including my husband got sloppy drunk. While others danced with drunk(ness) on the dance floor, including my husband, one, my ""lovely"" uncle step it up a notch and started to flirt with other women, while aunt is present and gotten rowdy. I was somewhat embarrassed and my aunt came to me to say she will handle it and taken my inebriated uncle outside to calm down. Luckily all this transpired shortly after my daughter went inside the house  with a older cousin whom we asked to babysit my daughter. Aside from my husband who could not remember half of the night and my crazy uncle who had to sleep away his liquor, overall the wedding was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. I got another chance to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary and once again fall in love with husband. That night also serves a reminder why I am once pregnant again months later.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLY7GNOVC
