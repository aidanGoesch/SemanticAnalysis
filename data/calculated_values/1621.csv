This was a very big deal for me and my family as I am the first in our family to ever do this. We came here from El Salvador about 10 years ago. We did not know the language, we had no friends, no money, just hope, determination, and the will to survive. My parents worked themselves to the bone to give me and my sister a better life. A life with opportunity, a life of choice and of freedom. In return, we worked hard for ourselves. We learned english, we made friends, we made good grades, and we stayed out of trouble. We owed that to them. When I received my first acceptance letter to college, my mother cried. I could see how proud she was. How this letter represented that all her sacrifice, all her hard work, that it was all paying off. When I went off to college, my father cried. I could tell that this was one of the proudest days of his life.  The day I graduated, they both cried together. I was so happy for both of them. This was the greatest gift I could ever give them. I owed everything to my family, and on that day, I honored them.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIGYQLAM7
