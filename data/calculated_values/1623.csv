I can;t wait to move into the new home I purchased! I never thought I would be able to say I am a home owner! Well, technically is it a mobile home. It is my home though, I own it. I am very proud of that. After the divorce I never thought I'd be able to own anything of my own ever again. It seemed like fate when I found that trailer. It is a double wide, it looks just like a house. It is brand new. No one has ever even lived in it before. And the best part is that it is in a mobile home community that I love. My best friend lives there with her kids. She says it is a great environment. There are no problems and no fighting neighbors. She says everyone keeps to themselves and is respectful. I have needed a change like this for a long time. Living in this apartment has been torture. I cannot wait to move in next week and start the rest of my life!",,39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSPXROYN
