It is a feeling like no other that something so big finally belongs to you. Excitement, and comfort of being able to say this is my home. It was a long process, buying a home. The first thought was to buy a house, but due to my husbands bankruptcy everything had to be put into my name. We found the home in Charlevoix Estates which is a Mobile home community. It is a double wide with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It has an Island in the kitchen, and a huge closet off the master bedroom. This is the first home that we have purchased for our family. We are over the moon excited about finally getting to have a place of our own. It feels like a dream come true. I am really excited about having Air conditioning throughout the whole house. That is great for us. Moving was challenging, getting everything out of our old house and moved into the new one. We have so much stuff, so it took a little bit of effort to get in and get settled. But like I said, when they handed me the keys and said this is yours now, I felt elated. Excited, and as though finally dreams of mine were coming true.",39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSPXROYN,
