I wanted to eat some food and watch the fireworks later on that evening. I didn't want to go alone, so I decided to ask my good friend and her boyfriend if they were busy that day. They said that they weren't, so I invited them out with me. They agreed to join. I met up with them at one of the hot spots for food trucks and firework displays in my city. I took an Uber there to avoid any issues with parking and suggested that they do the same. I waited for them near a condo building that had benches outside of it. They arrived about 15 or 20 minutes after I got there. We greeted each other and talked about what we wanted to do first. I mentioned that I was pretty hungry and they said that they were too, so we walked over to the food trucks and started browsing the menus. Everything was expensive, so we settled on the cheapest food truck which had basic tacos and sodas. We all ordered our food and chatted about our days as we waited. When our food was ready, we found a nearby bench to sit on and started eating. The food wasn't great, but we were happy to fill our bellies with something. Once we were done eating, we decided to just take a walk to kill time until the fireworks started. The area had a lot of little shops and a park so we just window shopped and strolled through the park afterwards. We chatted and laughed about stuff while we walked and when it was about 10 minutes before the fireworks show, we started walking back to the clearing near the food trucks so that we could get a good view. There was nowhere to sit, so we just found a good spot to stand. The show was a little late and didn't start on time, but we were pretty patient. When it finally did start, the show was amazing. The fireworks were huge and colorful. Everybody clapped when it was over and my friends and I hugged and parted ways. I went home feeling really happy and content from the days events.",39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSWRWOYN,
