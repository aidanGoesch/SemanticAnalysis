It has been such a long journey to find her, since we were separated so long ago. We were very young the last time we saw each other. I can't even remember how old we were, but it has been a very long time. I could never accept the fact that difficulties in our family had caused us to be separated. Before I was able to connect with her, I had made several attempts.  I tried searching all over the internet, and never had any real results. There were a few times I thought I was close, but they all ended up being nothing. I had gotten so discouraged over time, with so many failed attempts and dead ends. I would have thought with all the technology today, and social media, it would have been much easier. I had gotten to the point where I honestly thought I would never be able to find her! I was so thrilled when I received a message from one of her friends! That lead to us getting in touch with each other, and finally meeting up! It was worth the years searching. I can't wait to build a relationship with her, and try to make up for some of the lost years!",,39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSXL7OYN
