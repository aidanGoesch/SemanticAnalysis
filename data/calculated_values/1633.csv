After looking around, I really could not find any broker that was trustworthy. I decided to try this out for myself. I went on popular site Zillow, and put ""for sale by owner."" I also put an ad on several Chinese websites and newspapers. Everyone kept telling me that i would not be able to do this by myself. It is a common stigma that a broker is ""needed"" to sell a business. I was able to prove this untrue. While I did not sell it right away, i was able to sell it after a few months. I even had tons of parties interested in buying the restaurant. In addition to this, after I sold the restaurant, I did not have to pay the excessive sales fees that brokers typically charge. I was completely elated and proud of myself. I proved everyone wrong. After selling it, my mother threw me a party. I am even considering a career as a business broker. I think this will open up my future.",,39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSZA2YO8
