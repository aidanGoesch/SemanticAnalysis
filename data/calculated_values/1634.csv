I am looking forward to see the re-opening. I went up to the restaurant last weekend since it was the long weekend.  It was a shock to see how much has changed.  The new owner emptied the whole kitchen.  He is going to start everything new.  His plan is to first get the new kitchen running and start food take out next month, he and chef from NY, NY already working on the menu and asked me some advise.  He will then continue the front part of the sitting down meal part, aim to re-open the whole restaurant in the beginning of next year.  Then he is going to all new update upstairs and opening a bed and breakfast next Summer.  Things moving fast since he has two team of contractors working outside and inside at the same time.  Since I have 10% of the ownership of the restaurant, my job was to make the transfer from old and new smoothly, I found him the New York chef from New York city who had over 27 years experience. He was going to group his own kitchen staff.  Now my other job is going to try to give away the old tables and chairs, I have not had any luck.  One person replied after she saw my post and photos, she did not want all of them, so she was going to ask around to see anyone of her friends want some.  If I could not find any takers, it all goes to the dumpster.  I really hope someone will take them.",39KFRKBFIOHXIKJ9D6C9JKPSZA2YO8,
