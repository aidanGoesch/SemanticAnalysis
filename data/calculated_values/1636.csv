It was the firm. They told me that I was being put in charge of the Goodman Pants account. A relatively new upstart company, Goodman Pants is well known both for the quality of their product as well as their generous charitable contributions. I was to lead a team responsible for landing Goodman as a client. They have been very successful thus far but they are looking to expand their reach to the UK. If our advertising firm could land this account, it would be huge for us. I called Bob. Of all the members of the team, Bob is the one I trust the most. I discussed the situation with him. I wanted his input but I also made sure that I had the final say on any and all decisions regarding the Goodman account. Bob gave me some valuable advice on some of the other team members who he knew better than me. I used his advice to guide my decisions regarding who to put in charge of what. I put Susan in charge of coming up with slogans for the UK demographic. James and I would collaborate on our presentation for the Goodman people. Charles would be responsible for graphic design. We are nearly finished now and the big day is this Saturday. I think it's going well, but I'm feeling a lot of pressure. May luck be in my favor.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG76SI312
