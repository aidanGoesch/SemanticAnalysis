We were riding along the different trails and having a good time when we decided to stop at one of the benches and take a rest. We were sitting and talking when I saw something shiny sticking out of the leaves on the ground next to me. I reached down and found a cell phone that must have fallen out of someone's pocket. I picked it up and tried to turn the phone on but it was locked. I figured I could drop it off later at the office in the front of the park and tell them where I found it in case the owner comes back looking for it. We finished up our trail and decided to leave. As we were heading to the office to drop off the phone we saw an older lady also going into the office. When we went inside I overheard her asking the park ranger abut her lost phone. We told her we found it and she was very grateful. She explained that her husband had recently passed away and the phone was full of pictures of the two of them together. She would have been heartbroken to lose all those pictures. They were irreplaceable and meant the world to her. She thanked us profusely and we explained that we were happy to help. She even unlocked the phone and showed us some of her pictures.,,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG76SK314
