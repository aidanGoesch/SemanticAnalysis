We like going for longer rides out in the country because we love nature and it is quiet and we don't have to worry about a large volume of vehicles moving about. We are are traveling down this older paved road kind of in the middle of nowhere and we pass something flat on the road. I didn't initially think anything of it but I decided to turn around and go see exactly what it was. I rolled up to it and leaned over and discovered it was a phone case. Okay, I thought someone had just dropped a phone case out of their car window or something and that I would just throw this case away and help clean up road litter. Well, I picked it up and actually found that there was a phone within the case. Holy crap I thought, someone had actually lost their phone in the middle of nowhere, how did that happen? So I try to turn it on and it doesn't function and nothing works. It doesn't looked damaged but it clearly has run out of battery life. I thought about just leaving it there because I thought maybe someone would come back looking for their phone but my husband suggested I pick it up and bring it home and then report it to the department or the phone company if we could get it powered up and try to have it returned.  Well, we took it home and I put it into a drawer and decided I would get back to it as soon as I could because I just didn't have any time to fiddle with it that day. A few weeks had actually went by and I had forgotten all about it. I was looking for some tape to wrap a present and I checked the drawer and noticed the phone was there. I grabbed the tape next to the phone and finished up my wrapping but I went back to the phone and decided I would plug it in to see if it would power up. I managed to get it some power but I could not get past the initial power up lock phase so I had no idea who this belonged to or where to even bring it. Well, we only have 1 at&t store in our town so I figured I would just bring it to them and see if the phone was one of theirs. Turns out, it actually was one of their phones and the customer who owned it was looking for it. I left my name and my phone number and I obviously left the phone there and I went about my day knowing I had done a good deed. Well, two days later I actually get a call from an employee at the at&t store here and they tell me that this elderly woman was incredibly grateful because she had pictures on the phone of her late husband and the fact that the phone was returned had brought tears to her eyes because her phone was the only place that had those photos. Words could not describe the joy that I had when I had found out that the phone had found its home. I find it so bizarre that I was out in the middle of nowhere and I just happened to stumble upon this phone just lying there. I guess sometimes things just kind of happen for a reason and I am glad that things turned out great.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG76SK314
