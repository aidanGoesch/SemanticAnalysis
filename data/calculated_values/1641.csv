They went to a game in Florida, where our cousin had to play. Our cousin had a great game and played very well. At the end of the game, his mother and father were gonna celebrate his game victory, but instead there was a life threatening turn of events that occured. They waited and waited and he never came to the room. So soon after they got a call from the coach and during the call they heard frantic screaming in the background-it was their son.  The coach said we have called 911, your son is in severe pain.  So the EMTs arrived and picked him up. At that time, he began to have seizures. Once they arrived to the hospital, they rushed him in the back.  We all thought he was not going to make it through the night. When we received the first call, we were already in route to go to check on him.  The seizures continued until they had to give him some medicine to stop them. Things seemed to get better, but he stopped responding. Over the next day, he was not physically talking and continued having seizures. His body took a bad hit. All the tests were showing nothing was wrong. After a few days, the seizures stopped topping a total of 12 within a few days. He still was not talking, but he was alive! He did not talk for a week. Tests finally determined that he had suffered a heat stroke. Finally, an answer to the mysterious chaos. He became a living miracle. He regained his strength in walking then started talking. He still wants to play football, but it has not been recommended by doctors.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG76WZ31R
