I wanted to be the best lemonade stand salesman in the town. It wasn't easy at first. I had to establish my lemonade stand empire. I started with a couple of stands. I got enough money to expand it to a few streets. A month later, I had stands on every street in the town. This was a very exciting event for me. I made a lot of money because of this. I hope to expand my empire throughout the state. I will celebrate this occasion with a trip to the restaurant. I got a hamburger with some beer. They were both yummy to eat and drink. I hope my success continues. I will help a lot of people drink.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG7UFJ13Z
