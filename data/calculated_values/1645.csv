Until one day something odd happened. I wasn't feeling all to well that day so I didn't do as much as I normally do. I may have cut my tasks in half that day to the issues I was having. Eventually I had to sit down because I just kept feeling weirder and weirder. Once I sat down things got even more bad for me. I felt like I was losing my breath. Breathing in and out everytime it kept getting shorter. I was almost felt like I was being suffocated. I was under significant amount of pressure and experienced a panic attack. I was breating all crazy then I couldn't really catch my breath. At the time, I thought it might have been a heart attack or a stroke. Those issues don't run in my family so it was new to me. It was a very scary time to go through something like that alone. I used this as a sign to seek therapy from a counselor.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG7WWO316
