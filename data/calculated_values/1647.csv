I guess it just took a little bit to get used to rehab. I do know when I was sober which was rare before rehab, I had always wanted to try yoga. I guess this was just the time I was supposed to eventually try it. After about a week I was able to fully understand why I was in rehab. It was just something that I had to go through to get better. I know now that I really did need it, maybe at the time I did not which is probably normal. I know all of my friends and family know I needed it thought it was going to be helpful, but at the time obviously I was out of my mind. I think now that I have completed rehab and feel sober and fine, I would have to recommend it to everyone. Just know that at first you are going to hate it and want to leave, but please be patient.  I wanted that so much after a week, I wanted to get out asap, but that second week I felt better. I was able to finish my dinner without throwing it up, and the yoga was the best thing that ever happened to me. My mind became so much more clearer too in the end. I just felt like a new person when I was able to leave the place. And now I do yoga a few times a week and have never felt healthier. I just think that rehab was supposed to happen to me. I was supposed to get help, and in the end, that is more than okay.",,39L1G8WVWRDB6PFKIJL8HUG7XZG133
