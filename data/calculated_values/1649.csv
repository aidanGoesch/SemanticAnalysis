The news swept through the family like wildfire. Some of the family are trying to be supportive and helpful of our situation. Some of the others however, are wreaking havoc. They believe she can no longer be trusted to care for herself or important family things. They're blaming her for past incidences which never had a suspect before this diagnoses. All in all, the family is being ripped apart simply because my mother is ill.  The disease she has been diagnosed with isn't even that life changing, and yet some of my family are behaving like it's the end of their lives.  Some people just have that ability though, to turn someone elses problems into their own for sympathy or attention.  My mother is receiving treatment, and isn't much different from her former self.  She's not taking the mistrust of the family so well though, and it causes her to sometimes need to take extra medicine just to cope. I try to stop the family from bothering her.  They just can't see that they're actually making things worse. If they'd just leave her alone, treat her like they used to, then she would BE just like she used to. A small mental disease doesn't always completely change a person.",,39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NT086UIO
