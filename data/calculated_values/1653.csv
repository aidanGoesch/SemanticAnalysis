I work from home so my home computer is my life line, without it I simply couldn't get paid. Anyway two months ago my CPU suddenly just died. At first I had no idea what had went wrong, but apparently the cooling gel used to keep the CPU under extreme temps had mostly evaporated, so the CPU was over heating during my late night gaming sessions. At the point in time I didn't have enough money to buy a better CPU, I had just finished paying off a bunch of debt that I collected over the years. I pretty much thought I was screwed and maybe had to go out and get a temp job until I had enough money to replace my broken CPU. Anyway I had told my mom about it and I guess she told the family because a few days later my mom came over and handed me an envelop of money . At first I thought it was from her and I declined it, I didn't want to take my mother's hard earned money she got from working all those years. But she informed me a few of my brothers and sisters got together and pooled in money, enough that I could replace my CPU with a brand new powerful one. I'm not much of an emotional guy, at least in front of others. I try to always keep my cool and play it straight, but I couldn't help as the tears started to fall from my eyes. I was so grateful an thankful that people who loved and cared for me came through and went the extra mile for this. My family isn't rich, so I know them giving up their hard earned money to help me out was big. Not saying we're poor, but we're not rich enough were we can just give away money without a care in the world. My mom gave me a big hug and in that moment I felt the deepest amount of gratitude I ever experienced in my entire life. From the bottom of my heart I was truly deeply thankful. Later on I got together with my brothers and sisters that helped out, throwing them a party in their honor. It was the least I could do for such wonderful family members.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTGNSIU8,39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTGNSIU8
