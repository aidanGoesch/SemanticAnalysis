Sick of work, sick of people around me I decided it was time to do something for me. I decided I would run away from it all. To live the way that I wanted to live. In the beginning it was great. I got to see so much and do so many things I hadn't before. I even tried rock climbing and skydiving. It was an amazing experience. After a few weeks of this though I got a little tired of just living out of my truck. I missed the comfort of a bed and TV so I rented a motel room. That was a big mistake. I didn't think about how much that would cut into my funds. After only a few days in the motel room I had run out of money. I was determined though. I did NOT want to go back to my boring 9 to 5 job and monotonous lifestyle. I kept trying to live this lifestyle because it felt so good to me. While continuing my adventure I found a parking lot that I could stay in because it was never really full. Having no money made it hard though, I really couldnt keep up the adventurous lifestyle of pleasure I was seeking the way I wanted to anymore But I wasn't going to give up. That is until the worst case scenario happened. A few days after moving into that parking lot I heard a knock on my window. Two police officers were outside and they looked mad. They asked me what I was doing and I confidently explained that I left home to pursue a life of personal pleasure and to get away from it all. They weren't hearing it though and a couple minutes later I was asked to step out of the car where they cuffed me and took me to jail. I don't regret the time I spent away from my boring life but I wish I could have stayed away forever.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F0SB38D
