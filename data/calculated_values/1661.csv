I had recently been fired from my job, which was extremely depressing to me, and I fell into a depressed and low-energy state. I had been living with my mother for the last 6 months, and after being fired, I told my mother I'd be moving out at the end of the month due to my new bad habits, mainly involving drinking.  On the first of March, I drove my truck away from my mother's house, not to return for over 7 weeks. At first, I felt liberated - I knew I was homeless, but I had the freedom to do what I want, and didn't have anyone telling me what to do. I spent the first few weeks simply living in my truck, communicating with friends on the phone and generally just living a hedonic, isolated lifestyle. Eventually, I found it hard to even start taking care of my own basic needs (finding a bathroom, a safe place to park at night, etc.) and drove to a motel. Life living at the motel felt great - I finally had a warm bed to sleep in, a place where I felt safe - and each morning when I got up, I would rent one more night. I ended up staying at this motel for about 3 weeks. Unfortunately, I started this adventure with $3000, and by the time early April rolled around, I found I had less than $300 left in my bank account. At this point, I drove even further away from the city, to a Wal-Mart. I spent a few days and nights there, doing the same things - charging up my phone at the local starbucks, drinking, etc. To me, I felt like I was running out of time, and didn't know what to do. I was getting sick nearly every day. Finally, I realized I needed help. I tried to drive back in to town to check myself into a hospital, but halfway there, I was pulled over by a state patrol officer. I was handcuffed for driving under the influence. Thankfully, I was cooperative and polite with him, and he agreed to drop me off at the hospital, where I stayed for five days. My adventure was over.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F0SB38D
