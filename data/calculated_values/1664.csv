We had a lot of fun. But when we were just enjoying ourselves, a snake actually appeared! Can you believe it? A snake appearing in the middle of a wedding! That's preposterous and unheard of! Why would a snake even appear at the wedding like that. It makes no sense and it scared many people who was there. I tried to stay calm, but I was scared too! The snake should not have been at the wedding. Somehow, someone got rid of it, but I will always remember it's hisses and menacing eyes. A great event turned into a fearful event. I never want to experience something like that again. It was just horrible. But at least we got through it.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F8MJ38H
