Getting married at 24 is such a odd thing but apparently he had fine his women that he wants to spend the rest of his life with. The wedding was very memorable and very fun to remember, because there were tons of events for everyone and it was also inclusive probably something my friend did to accommodate me and my boyfriend. The wedding was beautiful it had all this flowers and decorations that made the place very lovely, and very happy itself. The people were all dancing and everybody was dressed very fancy where you can tell the wedding was for refined tastes. Personally I don't like dressing fancy normally but it looked very good with me. But what was more surprising was since the wedding took place out of the city we had a unexpected guest. It was a rattle snake and it almost bite me if it wasn't for another person that catch it, I don't know what would have happened. Therefore it could have deadly. Thank goodness I was safe from the snake. Everything went normally afterwards and we ended the night on a high note. It was a experience that you would never forget about the wedding. It makes me want to get married one day. It's a relief that now you can marry who you want. I am a very envious men.",39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F8MJ38H,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F8MJ38H
