I knew he was sick, but it was still such a shock. He used to work in Detroit. He would clean the car parts in a chemical solution without gloves. He would just dip them in. Well, He got cancer behind one of his kidneys. The doctors told him this cancer was only caused by a specific chemical. I called him while he was in the hospital and he told me not to worry. He said, ""kiddo, I love you, I will always take care of you."" I thought he meant in the sense of how a parent loves their child after they pass away. I was able to fly over and see my dad before he died. As I was cleaning up the house afterwards, a lawyer showed up. I didn't think anything of it. Paperwork to sign cause dad passed away. Ni biggie. Did not think of it again til yesterday. Yesterday a huge check showed up from dad. Huge.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F9F938U
