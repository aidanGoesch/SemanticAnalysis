He graduated a few months ago and will be leaving for college in the next few days.  Where has the time gone?  Seems like just yesterday he was learning to walk.  Now he's a grown man ready to set out on his own.  It really was a wonderful week.  His father and grandparents came in from out of town.  It's amazing how much he looks like their side of the family.  They had a great reunion and vowed to stay in touch.  He'll be going to school about 30 minutes from where they live so I'm sure they'll see each other often.  I feel a little reassured that he'll have them close by should an emergency come up.  And I know they'll get to spend a lot more time together.  Funny how life works like that.  I was also surprised that they had so much in common.  Seemed they were never lacking for conversation, so much to catch up on.  I do for see a lot of football and Nascar in their future.  As much as I hate him moving away, I'm so excited for his future and where it's leading.  My baby has grown up.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43FK5I83Z
