What was memorable about theexperience was that it caused a reunion between my son and his father. They hadn't seen each other for 12 years. It wasnt due to myself or my son. His father just never attempted to visit.  I took a chance about a month before the graduation and invited his father and his family. To our surprise they attended.  My son seemed pleased. He got to spend hours visiting his father and family. I could see the happiness in them both. Although it was tough for me to see my ex-husband again, I dealt with it for my son. It was quite hard for me to be around my ex as it brought-up many bad memories and emotions. He was abusive to me and it took me years to get over it all. What was moving was seeing my son's reaction to being around his father. He seemed a little shy but happy to see him and talk with him. Ever since that day, they have spoken on the phone or texted often.",,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43FK5I83Z
