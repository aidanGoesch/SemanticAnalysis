I had told him that one of the commandments were thou shalt not have any other God. And he asked me what that meant, and I described them as having idols. I told him how idols could be anything you put before God, like video games, people, etc. He was like well dad what about music? I replied even music, and sooner than he said that I think he asked because he wanted to know if that's what I had been doing. It was almost like he was speaking to me but unknown to him I believed that God was speaking through him. I normally spend hours on end creating and writing songs. Forgetting to give God his time by praying and reading the bible. I continued to speak to my son about this and the more I spoke to him about it, the more I realized I was actually teaching myself a lesson. It is very funny how that works out, trying to teach your child about something but really you may be teaching yourself or gaining more clarity on a subject. This happens to me sometimes when talking to my son because it's like I'll be thinking about if I'm just talking or am I showing him through setting a good example as a father. Talking the talk is not as hard as walking the walk. Since that day I have made sure to give God more time in my life and have tried to continue represent myself as a father who walks the walk. Lessons come in many shapes and sizes!",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931R06D9PB
