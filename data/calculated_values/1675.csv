It is called HSP for shor. Children's Hospital has kept up with it. They make sure she has no major problems from it. There have been no more rashes. They were bad to see. The protein and blood in urine are bad. The other levels are fine. Protein and blood are expected for a year. I am glad she has not had more rashes. They did not hurt. They looked bad. It made us sad. We were scared. I am glad we know more now. I am glad there are people who know about it. I am glad our local doctors knew what it was. I am glad they referred us to the specialists. We were blessed by God it was not worse.,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931R06DP9R,
