She was broke out in bad rash. She had been diagnosed with flu shortly before.  She was taking Tamiflu. They thought it was a reaction to that. The rashes got worse and had spread more by then. The following week she went to a different doctor since she wasn't getting better. They said she had Henoch Shonlein Purpura. It can come on after a virus or such. It is very rare. It is a disorder, characterized by rashes. It is when blood vessels leak. Most people we told had never heard of it before. The rashes were horrible. Thank God they did not hurt. Protein and blood in urine happened with it too. It has to be watched. The rashes went away and the protein levels are dropping. It was horrible and scary seeing those rashes.",39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931R06DP9R,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931R06DP9R
