In fact, we probably spend more time with the people we work with than almost anyone else. we tend to have sex more often. we tend to share all things together. we used to hangout at coffee shop. we used to visit lot of tourist place. we would chat at our leisure time. we loved other colleagues too.  Since you're likely also surrounded by people you have things in common with, it's not all that surprising that people fall in love at work. A work spouse relationship is born, where you share the trials and tribulations of the workplace with each other, have lunch together, and emotionally depend on one another. In other cases, the people involved may not have put strong boundaries in place, and they can start to behave inappropriately.         But it's how you handle this attraction that's important. If you're not careful, the situation can fall into the realm of micro-cheating, which is essentially where you cheat, but only a little bit. we had a wonderful memories over the past week. it was awesome. we took a lot of picture.",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RPGM9PT
