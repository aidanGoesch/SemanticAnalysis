I went to my aunt and uncle's house and saw them and my grandparents and my sister. We had a meal together and had a good time. The 4th of July is also my grandfather's birthday so we celebrated that as well. He has late stage Alzheimer's and was not able to enjoy the event as much as us. There was also an argument that broke out between my sister and my aunt about politics that left the memory of the event slightly soured. They started arguing about Socialism and it turned into an argument about a variety of things from global warming to Donald Trump. My mother ended up joining in, which is unusual for her. My aunt is very against Socialism and supports Trump. My sister and mother are against Trump. My sister is also very worried about the environment and said that is the reason why she will not have kids. While they were arguing, I said nothing. I had hoped politics would not come up. I wanted to think of ways to change the conversation, but at that point nothing I said would have been effective. I also did not want my grandparents to be upset. By the end of the day, many people were upset and I was disappointed it turned out that way.",39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RR7V9PM,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RR7V9PM
