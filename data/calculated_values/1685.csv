We both love to swim and it is very important to us to have a house that has a pool in the backyard where we can swim, relax, and have pool parties with our friends.  I was beginning to get discouraged because we had not found anything we liked yet and had been looking for awhile, but three weeks ago we found the perfect home.  We made an offer and the seller accepted!  I was very nervous when waiting to hear if our offer had been accepted.  Now we are dealing with the closing of the sale.  I must say, this part is difficult and nerve wracking too.  I'm nervous about the inspection and the appraisal too.  I keep feeling like something will fall through and there is so much to attend to.  I never knew buying a house could be so stressful.  At this point, we have been a little surprised by how accommodating the seller has seemed to be.  They even offered to fix up a few things we didn't like about the house which I was not expecting them to do.  Either they are suspiciously nice or we got lucky, I'm not sure!  I guess it is possible that they genuinely are just really nice people so who knows.  Either way, I can't wait for this to be done and for the sale to be complete.  I am ready to move into our new house and have our first pool party.",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1T9P9
