Close and move in date are weeks away. There is not a day that goes by at this point I don't think about it. I'm nervous and excited at the same time. There is a hurricane out there that could put a dampener on our closing date but I try to push that out of my mind and only think good thoughts. The home has a pool so I am very excited to spend a lot more time out doors. It's pretty hot and humid here so you really must be around water to be comfortable outside. Although this event is about to happen I still think about the day our offer got accepted. I walked through that house thinking, there is no way we're getting this house. It was just so beautiful. It had all the finishing touches I would have done myself. Now I don't have to redo anything! I just still can't believe this house is going to be ours. I can't stop thinking about how I want to decorate it. I also want do some gardening. Owning my home will allow me to do anything I want with my yard. I expect the excitement will increase the closer we get to our closing date. we are very much looking forward to being in our new home.",39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1T9P9,
