We recently looked at one with a pool and lanai and made an offer. They accepted our offer and we are in the last stages of purchasing the home. I remember when we got the phone call that they accepted our offer. I was so excited that I could hardly contain myself. I think about the house all the time and what I would like to do to it to make it my own. I also keep thinking about how excited I was when we got the phone call. I get joyful tears every time I think about it. When we got the call I called my mom first because she lives the closest to me. I called my dad after that because he will be visiting in the near future and I think he well enjoy his visit in this home. He will like having a pool to enjoy on his visit. I called my brother to tell him the good news and I'm sure he will be bringing his dogs over for a swim soon. I cannot express how excited I am about this new chapter of my life. I am a bit nervous with hurricane season upon us but I guess that's life. You cannot predict everything.,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1T9P9,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1T9P9
