We had a huge coming home party for him. It was such a joyous occasion. We had not seen him for over a year. He was so happy to be home. We invited all of his friends and family. Unfortunately some of our relatives got really intoxicated and got into a physical alteration. The police were called and his father ended up getting arrested for assault when he tried to break up the fight. I feel so embarrassed and ashamed of these family members. I really wanted this to be a happy time for my son, but he ended up so upset, and unfortunately, this has caused a huge strain on a few of our family's relationships. What should have been a great celebration, ended up being an event filled with bad memories. My son is the one who should have been celebrated. Instead, certain family members decided to be selfish. They decided to focus on unnecessary drama.  I have apologized to my son. He said that it is all right, but I do not agree. It will be a long time before I consider having those relatives at any events in the near future.",31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYEAMOV6,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYEAMOV6
