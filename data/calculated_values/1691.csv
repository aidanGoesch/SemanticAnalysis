I realized that the world is a grey area and not just black and white. The world works in mysterious ways and I say roll with an open mind. That's the only way you can function. If you try to take on the world it will bite you. So, go in with no expectations or as a superhero to try to fix it. Take life in stride, enjoy and drink some coffee. Know that what happens is going to happen. Take all your problems one at at time. Enjoy the small things in life like your cat, dog, kids. Do yogo every morning to ease your day. If someone bumps you, say sorry, move on. All in all, 2 months ago I learned a valuable lesson. Keep an open mind. I love my life.",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RYKR9PF
