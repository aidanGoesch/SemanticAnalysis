I had reserved a camping site just in time, and for my arrival I was able to comfortably set up the campsite without much hassle. I took the time to immerse myself in the many sites and sounds of the park, and found seeing the various geysers including Old Faithful to be a highlight of a trip. Nevertheless, I still found time and interest in hiking in Upper Yellowstone, picking out Lamar Valley as the ideal location to traverse hikes or trails. My hike in Lamar Valley would occur one afternoon, on an eventful day where I had already seen wildlife already in person, including bison and deer. Naturally I would try to keep my distance away from the wildlife, knowing well enough the dangers and threats they may pose to me if provoked. This would however become difficult along the trail as I encountered a new animal stumbling near the trail. More specifically, an animal while familiar would be one that I have never imagined I would see up close before. Along the trail neared a very large bear, with brown fur. Despite having seen other kinds of bears before, I naturally froze once I quickly identified the species of the bear. Seeing the prominent hump on its back, that signifies the bear as a grizzly bear, invoked various thoughts in me regarding the power and speed a grizzly bear is capable of. More so, thoughts of how to handle a grizzly bear also came to mind, which included not making any quick and sudden movements and making my presence known. I would find some relief in realizing that despite being too close for my personal safety, the grizzly was more interested in other matters. Keeping my distance while the grizzly foraged around for food, I watched as it would eventually walk elsewhere. The tense moment would dissipate as it went out of sight, the only reminder of such an incident were the photographs I managed to take of the bear, and my first-hand experience. I would quickly afterwards finish up the hike, the rest of the day being tame in comparison to my encounter with the bear, although just as memorable. The event was a highlight of my trip, one that I was fortunate enough to experience, and one that reminds me of the beauty and danger of nature.",39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RZ5L9PG,
