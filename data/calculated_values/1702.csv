He and i weren't well for one another. There had been past instances of cheating, and being bored. We both tried for months on end to figure everything out, and become a better pair. But it just wasn't working. It became to the point where we hardly wanted to spend time with one another because it would always end up in fights. Our son is around the age now where he can start remembering any fights or arguments. So, we essentially made this decision mainly for him. He deserves two happy parents. Even if the parents aren't together, just knowing everything is peaceful is important. It's important for us to be mature. Not only for ourselves, but for our son. I don't want him to ever think back to hard times. I want him to know his parents did what they had to in order for him to have a healthy childhood. Not a childhood he'd have to recover from.",,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZY0UCC34
