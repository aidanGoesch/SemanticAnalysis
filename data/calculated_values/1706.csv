It has taken me way longer than I could have ever possibly imagined, but I did it. Today was the day that I became a college graduate at 44 years young. So when I wake up and look in the mirror every morning, I won't see myself any longer. I will look into it and I will see someone who now holds an Associate's Degree in Criminal Justice. And every night when I lay down my head to go to sleep, I will replay the memories of the proud looks my family had on their faces as I walked across that stage and became a new person. I will no longer remember or even concern myself with the struggles I endured or even the amount of time it took me to reach this goal. I will only remember that I reached my goal. I will only concern myself with the things that await me on the other side. I'd like to personally thank all of those who never thought I would be here to see this. I'd like to thank all of those that frowned upon me and told me that I was ""too old to ever be in school."" Now look at me. The only thing I am too old for is to listen to haters. I'm as young as I feel and right now I feel as if my life is just starting! So thank you self for giving me a gift so great. I will never, ever forget it. I love you and you are my hero!",,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYTQQC33
