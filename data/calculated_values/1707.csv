I FELT I COULD HAVE HAD A WONDERFUL CAREER . HOWEVER, I LET OTHER THINGS IN MY LIFE DERAIL THAT AND NEVER WENT BACK. I WAS SO EXCITED TO FINALLY GET THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AT 40. I LOST MY JOB ON MATERNITY LEAVE AND FELT IT WAS THE BEST TIME TO GO BACK. SO BECAUSE I DID NOT HAVE A CAR OR A SITTER I DID IT ONLINE. IT WAS NOT EASY I WORKED ONLINE,TOOK CARE OF MY BABY AND STUDIED. I TOOK ME FOUR YEARS TO GET MY ASSOCIATES DEGREE BUT I DID IT. BEST OF ALL I DID IT WITH HONORS WHICH WAS VERY EXCITING. I LOVED GOING BACK TO SCHOOL IT HELPED ME FEEL LIKE AN ADULT AGAIN AND HELPED ME USE MY BRAIN. IT WAS HARD THOUGH TO TRY TO STUDY ESPECIALLY WITH SICK CHILDREN OR THERE WAS OTHER DISTRACTIONS BUT I STUCK TOO IT. IT WAS SOMETIMES HARD TO TELL MY FAMILY SORRY I CANNOT PLAY OR GO OUT BECAUSE I HAD TO STUDY. THANKFULLY THEY UNDERSTOOD HOW IMPORTANT THIS WAS TO ME. I WAS SO EXCITED TO FINISH AND GET MY CAP AND GOWN IN THE MAIL . I POSTED IT ON SOCIAL MEDIA WITH MY EXCITEMENT. FINALLY THE CAME THE DAY FOR GRADUATION I WAS PROUD AND EXCITED. MY MOM,AUNT,FIANCE AND TWO BOYS GRADUATED WITH HONORS FROM COLLEGE. LITTLE DID I KNOW IT WAS GOING TO BE A ROLLER COASTER OF A RIDE AFTER MY GRADUATION.  MY FIANCE HAD A HEART ATTACK AND I HAD TO SPEND MY TIME IN THE HOSPITAL TRYING TO FINISH MY CLASSES SO I COULD EARN THAT DEGREE. I DID NOT THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE AND IT WAS VERY HARD. HOWEVER, I DID NOT GIVE UP . THEN I FEW MONTHS LATER MY DIPLOMA ARRIVED IN THE MAIL.",39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYTQQC33,
