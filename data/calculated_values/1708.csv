I BECAME A STAY AT HOME MOM 5 YEARS AGO UNEXPECTEDLY. I DECIDED TO TAKE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK TO COLLEGE TO GET MY DEGREE. IT WAS LOTS OF HARD WORK ESPECIALLY TAKING CARE OF TWO CHILDREN ONE BEING A NEWBORN. I ALSO WORKED PART TIME ON THE COMPUTER. MY GRADUATION WAS A BEAUTIFUL SATURDAY MORNING. ALL MY CLOSE FAMILY WAS IN ATTENDANCE TO SEE ME WALK THE STAGE. MOST MEMORABLE PART WAS ME GETTING HONORS WITH MY DEGREE . IT WAS A VERY SPECIAL DAY. I WILL REMEMBER WALKING THE STAGE WITH PRIDE. I HAD FINALLY ACCOMPLISHED WHAT I REALLY WANTED TO DO. I WAS ABLE TO GET MY DEGREE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. WHAT MADE IT MORE EMOTIONAL WAS THAT MY KIDS GOT TO SEE ME GET MY DEGREE. WE THEN GOT TO GO OUT TO DINNER TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE. AFTER THE CEREMONY WE GOT TO COME HOME AND HAVE SOME CAKE TO CELEBRATE. IT WAS AMAZING TO SEE ALL THE ADULTS GET THEIR DEGREE. I NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD EVER GET MY DEGREE BECAUSE I WORKED WITH MY FIRST SON. SO STAYING HOME AND BEING A ONLINE STUDENT WAS A BLESSING . I HOPE TO WALK THE STAGE AGAIN FOR ME BACHOLRS DEGREE.,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYTQQC33,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYTQQC33
