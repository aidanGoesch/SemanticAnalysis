It was the first time we'd been able to go to our own son's restaurant since he opened it in October. The drive to Rockdale was a little shorter than I imagined. Fifty miles from driveway to parking lot. A short hour depending on traffic. I'm glad we went on a Thursday. There's usually a long line to get to the window just to order but today we only had to wait about eight minutes. I got the combination plate of brisket and ribs. Mona got turkey breast as usual. They brought it out to us in less than ten minutes and we sat at a picnic table under the large pecan trees that surrounded the lot. I have to admit it was among the best Texas style brisket that I've ever had. I couldn't believe that my own son had turned his hobby of  competing in BBQ competitions all over Texas into an actual restaurant. And this place was fast becoming a recognized BBQ joint on the famed Texas BBQ trail. Texas Monthly had singled Brett's place out in the top 50 in the state and among the top 25 new places in the state. It was that good! I'm proud that Brett followed his passion and opened up his own place. He's getting a lot of recognition for his BBQ in terms of taste, quality, and innovation in the dishes he comes up with. It is definitely not the typical old style Texas BBQ. This is true craft BBQ on par with Aaron Franklin's place in Austin. He's competing on that level now. I would never have believed that when he first started talking about doing this some years ago. I really thought it would never happen but here I was sitting down at my son's dream BBQ joint and it was really good stuff. I couldn't be happier for him or prouder of him right now. I hope it all works out for him long term. He works long hours and I worry about him burning out but he is a people person and he loves to create new dishes and serve them to his friends.",,39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGE4GDYFZ
