I haven't written here in a while because I've been preoccupied with my illness, but it seems like it's completely gone!  And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.  Now it's the ninth week and I haven't had one yet.  I may put on a little weight from eating so much cheese, but I'd rather be chubby than in agonizing pain from migraine headaches.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYQNKVOD
