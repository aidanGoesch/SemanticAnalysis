Went from house to house , shelter , car & outta state. Being out of state was depressing and lonely. But that’s where we had a roof on our heads. Still didn’t have a place to call home though. Recently.. literally like 3 weeks ago we moved back to our home town. We found a house within that first week. We moved in this past Monday and it’s been the happiest we’ve ever been. Only thing is now we have the roof over our heads and no money to take care of everything. I’m hoping everything continues to go good from here and on out we only deserve the best. It’s been a long journey. Scary, sad, happy, confusing and much more. We’ve been through a lot. Hell and back literally. This is our time to shine.",39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGE79LYFW,
