She died of a stroke and it was traumatic for my whole family. I connected with so many emotions at that time and felt a deep love for my mother.  At the funeral shortly after, I read my eulogy and got a great deal of comfort in providing a tribute to this amazing woman. I saw all the people from her life gathered in one place to pay tribute. I saw people I had not seen years who loved her very much.  I helped my father through his own grief.  I helped him pack up my mother's things and sell the house.  I found all my mother's old diaries which was deeply moving.  My wife and I took in her dog which I knew she would want. The event also brought my family much closer together - not an easy thing as we are all so different and often do not get along. Experiencing my mother's death, I feel, changed my profoundly and helped me connect with other people and taught me to love more emotionally. Feelings long cut off by me were restored. In the weeks that followed I felt and feel a greater connection to her. I will love her always.",,39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGEG3WFYL
