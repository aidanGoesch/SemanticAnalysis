I had several items as I finished my quick trip.  When I got to the checkout, there were a few people ahead of me. I waited patiently to get to the register. As I was waiting I noticed a woman behind me with e few items. I offered to let her go ahead of me. She gratefully accepted and thanked me. After a couple of minutes, she was next at the checkout. The cashier completed her order and gave the woman her change. The woman then turned around to me and handed me a hundred dollar bill. I was so shocked, I couldn't believe it! I tried telling her no but she wouldn't let me give it back to her. She said I had done her a great favor. I kept thanking her over and over. I never would have expected anything so generous. I ended up with such a huge smile on my face that lasted forever, it seemed. Now every time I go to that store I get a smile on my face as I remember what that wonderful stranger did that day. I think she was an Angel or something.",,39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECATVT
