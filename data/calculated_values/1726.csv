My husband unexpectedly got sick.  He was the only person working in our family.  I was a stay at home mom of 4.  We thought it was a short term illness and everything would get back on track. We expected he would be able to go back to work.  The complete opposite happened.  He got sicker and passed away very quickly.  For the last couple of years we had been trying to just get through some rough patches financially.  We lived paycheck to paycheck.  Bills started getting behind.  Then there were extra expenses of hospital stays and then a funeral.  I ended up losing everything we had tried to work for.  I had no back up plan.  I was all alone with no one to help me figure out how to get back on track.,,39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7
