This event was about how I had a company that refurbished old abandoned homes and fixed them up to sell them for a higher price. One of the big reasons that my company started to go under was the fact that a serial killer had started murdering people a couple miles from the house I bought. This caused the house to sit on the market for months until the police caught the guy and by that time it was to late and I had run out of money for my business. One of the most memorable experiences I had at the time was realizing I was really down to the wire. When I had to start selling things to pay for my mortgage and electricity that was a very scary time in my life. Another memorable experience and probably the hardest was selling the tools that I had used to fix up the houses. That part was significant because that is when I had really realized that this is over and I need to start planning for what was coming. Also to try and to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy. I am less anxious and stressed now that I am living in a smaller apartment. I still wish that I would have realized that my business was failing and I should have sold my stuff more preemptively than when I had done so. I now take more ownership for my business going under. I should have had more money saved up than I did, and I do take ownership for my company failing even though it failed under such strange circumstances. Taking ownership is significant because it lets me be able to be around others when I am going through trying times instead of trying to push the blame on others. So people will be less nervous around me. I think now I do wish I could go back and fix the mistakes that I had made but the only thing we can do is push forward. I am still saving up money to try and redo the business now that I have more knowledge than before, but time will tell what happens with that.",39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7,
