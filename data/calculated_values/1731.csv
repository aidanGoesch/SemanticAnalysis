It was a truly unfortunate situation, as he was simply driving down the street to the grocery store just half mile away from home. He didn't need to go out that night. He was minding his own business when a drunk driver struck him head on and killed him. The other driver walked away unscathed. The circumstances of the crash had us all really searching for greater meaning to why terrible things happen to otherwise good and undeserving people. We decided to get together to mourn collectively after a few months had passed thinking it would help us all move forward with our lives. We couldn't seem to shake the sheer random nature of such unfortunate violence and it helped to commune and speak about how his passing had affected us and our hopes, views, and beliefs. We resolved to meet together once a year to honor Dino's memory, and to examine how we are all doing existentially. We hope that continuing to meet will become a tradition that takes on even greater meaning as the years go by. It can grow to become a gathering that none of us would dare miss, no matter how far away from each other we find ourselves. The group can even grow and take on new members who never knew Dino. To dream even larger about the potential of this event, it could even become a broader community celebration of those who were once close to us but have since passed. I hope this dream can come to fruition. I hope many community members find that they can benefit from such reflection. I hope I can find solace in the comfort of my friends and neighbors. I hope it becomes something really cool and something we can be proud of. I hope I hope I hope.",,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52M8O2MBY
