I had no problems at the time so I was happy. Then 10 weeks ago I got into a car accident and broke my hip and other areas. I needed to stay in the hospital. The hostpital bill and unpaid bills overwhelmed me. I couldn't afford them even if they were made into payment plans. It was just too much money for someone like me. I had pretty decent friends at work that wanted to help me. So I did listen to what they had to say. I really didn't get much advice that could help out. I did have a coworker that said a donation drive may be able to help out with bills. I thought that was a good idea as well but who would donate. It turns out almost everyone donated. People i knew and people I didn't know. Random people came up to help me in my need. They were also able to help me pay my bills.,,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MIZUBMB
