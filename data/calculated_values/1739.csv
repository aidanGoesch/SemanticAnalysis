I got into a car crash, and I needed to get a surgery for a broken hip and other broken bones. Not only did I get charged a large medical bill in the tens of thousands, I also could not work for about three months, which also led to me not making at money at the time. I didn't have enough money to pay for the bill, or to even pay for monthly bills since I didn't make any money while I was at the hospital. I cried for days at the hospital and felt depressed, but then something unexpected happened. While I was at the hospital, a co-worker of mine named Jeff heard about my situation, and actually started a donation drive to help pay my bills. The donation drive came from everywhere, not only from my friends and family but people I hardly knew. People from online even donated, when a gofundme page was posted up. When I first saw the money, I wondered how Jeff got the spare cash to pay it out of his pocket, but after he told me, I broke down crying in my hospital bed. The money collected while I was at the hospital didn't pay for all my bills, but it came surprisingly close. I was really happy and grateful to all the people that took out a moment to spare a dollar or two for me. It may not have been much individually, but when you get hundreds of people, everything adds up. This experience taught me that despite all the pessimism in the world today, there are still good people. Moreover, it shows that every little thing can count, since they can add up over time until the proverbial molehill really does become a mountain. It was a life changing experience for me - literally - and I have since then had a much more positive outlook on life. If people didn't help me at this moment, I would've been financially ruined, and words cannot express my gratitude.",39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MIZUBMB,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MIZUBMB
