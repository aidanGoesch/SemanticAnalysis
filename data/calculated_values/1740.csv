It's hard for all of us. I wish I could help my family go through this, but I can barely help myself right now. It was so bad I took a leave of absence from med school today. I am sad I'll be behind my friends and classmates but I know I have to do this for myself, and for mom. She always wanted me to be a doctor and it was my dream too. I won't be able to be a good doctor if I can't focus in class and rotations because I'm depressed. By taking time off, I'm preparing myself to get back to an appropriate mental state. I will have three semesters left to complete when I go back. I hope I can become a good doctor that can help the people who suffer from the same things mom died from. I don't know what I'm going to do during this time. Travel? Find a hobby? Find new friends? Sit at home? I don't know.",,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MIZUMBM
