I miss her. It has been hard for everyone to recover. I took time off from school and work. My boss is giving me a hard time about it. He said 'everyone does, get over it, I don't pay you to mourn.' I had no choice but to show up during more than half of the days that I requested off to grieve because my boss threatened to fire me if I missed too many days. I have student loans so I can't afford not to show up. I feel much like a slave because of this. I feel that this is a basic thing that I should be able to take time off for but I am told that I can't. My boss is my master. On the way to work, I was in a horrible car accident. My car was totaled but I was ok so I took an uber to work. I was late so my boss screamed at me and then fired me on spot. I have since lost my home. I am typing this on my phone because that is all I have left. I can't wait to die so that I cna be with my mom.",,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MIZUMBM
