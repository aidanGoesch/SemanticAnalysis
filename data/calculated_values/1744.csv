This is my story of diagnosis to acceptance. I had been bothered by tremors for a long time, but when they told me it was Parkinson's, I couldn't believe it. That's a disease that old people get (or so I thought), and I'm only 38. Once it sank in, I felt scared. Scared of losing my independence and my life. I had hoped to live a long time. There was so much I wanted to do, and I wouldn't get the chance to do it. Thinking of everything I would miss out on made me depressed. I tried to fight it - I didn't have time to be depressed anymore. But I spent several days in bed, brooding over my fate. Finally, I decided to reach out. I contacted my church first, and then a trusted group of friends. I was amazed at how many people offered their support. People I didn't know or hadn't spoken to for a long time asked if they could give me a ride somewhere, help me around the house, or just listen to me. It took a while, but I eventually started to accept the offers. And I eventually started to accept what was happening to me. I have trials ahead of me, but I also have people who will help me face them.",,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ1HBM3
