There is no family history of Parkinsons and I am not in a high risk group. At the time of the diagnosis I was going through significant upheaval in my life. I was going through a divorce, trying to diagnose a heart issue, and was four years post thyroid cancer surgery. I have been through a lot in my life. Some have told me they dont know how I do it. Honestly looking back I dont know how I did it either. Regardless I remember sitting in the neurologists office and getting the diagnosis. I was numb. I was confused. I was upset. Most of all I felt defeated. You never expect a diagnosis like that at 42. I walked out in a fog and stayed there for quite a while. I have since come to learn that my life isnt over. My life will be different, different experiences and challenges, but I have chosen to live it to the best of my ability.",39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ1HBM3,
