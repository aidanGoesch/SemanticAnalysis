I'm so frustrated. I can't believe the crap that is going on. My plans for rooming with my buddy have fallen through so now I'm gonna have to scramble for another arrangement. She'd invited me to go fishing with her for some relaxing girl-time and while out there, she dropped the bad news. I understand her reasons but it is still so frustrating for my own situation. Oh well, I love her and she is important to me so I can only accept her decisions and make the best of my own. It was considerate for her to take the time to tell me in person in a personal way instead of just texting me or not informing me at all. Plus I have the time to look for other options. I have no intention of letting this damage our friendship. Moving forward, I need to make plans to find another living situation. I've looked for others to room with but have had no luck yet. I hate putting random ads up but it is a viable option. I can also get an apmt that I can afford alone but the areas available are usually very creepy. I suppose I could move in with my boyfriend but that puts a completely different strain on the relationship. Of course, my mom wants me to move back with her, hahahahaha.",,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ2QMBP
