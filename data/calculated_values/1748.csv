I invited my friend out to the dock that we usually hang out. It took her a few days to even respond to the message and when we got out there I could tell that she was pretty uncomfortable. I tried just having a general conversation and I could tell that she was not going to bring up what happened. After fishing for about five minutes I decided to just get to the point and ask her why she did not want to be roommates. She tried to beat around the bust a bit but ended up telling me that she did not want to give up her privacy and freedom of living alone. This was kind of what I figured but when I said I already pointed this out when SHE was convincing ME to be her roommate she just ignored what I had to say. I just simply stated that this was not how friends should communicate to each other and that if something was on her mind then just tell me. After we got this out of the way I continued to fish and cast my pole. I caught a couple of smaller bait fish and then threw them out on my line. I let my friend just sit in silence as I was not making conversation and I could tell this made her uncomfortable. I decided to sit in silence until she broke it. This was a relaxing experience for me as I enjoy the silence and nature. I offered my friend a cigarette to break the ice and get conversation going again and I could tell she was relieved. We talked a bit more and then ended up leaving to go to our houses. I talked to my girlfriend about what happened and then decided to move on and forget the roommate situation all together.,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ2QMBP,
