Each July a group of 10 of us go to Albany, New York for business. There's a core group of about 6 of us that's gone every year. This year, I spent more time with one particular coworker. When we got back home, we decided to continue the friendship and hang out outside of work. We would text, go to dinner, watch movies, go hiking, etc. It progressed into a romantic relationship. What surprised me the most was that he was interested in me in that way, because I'm 22 years older than he is. I thought he seemed interested, but told myself I must be imagining it because how could he possibly be attracted to someone so much older. But we enjoy each others' company and have a lot of fun together. I've been divorced for 18 years, and haven't been in a relationship for 4 years. I have 2 daughters that aren't much younger than he is. We share the same sense of humor and have a lot of other things in common. It's nice to have someone to go do things with again. He genuinely seems interested in what I have to say and how I feel about things.",31HQ4X3T3TWSGD43184S9HXXK1NLSH,
