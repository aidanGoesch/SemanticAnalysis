It took place in River Falls, WI in a small hockey arena.  It was July 27th, the middle of summer.  It was hot as hell.  My team was from MN.  We were one of the first teams that arrived.  I made weight at 166 lbs.  I was geared up and ready for war.  I was ready to tear everybody's head off from the other teams.  I was mean mugging everyone like a motherfucker.  I didn't care who they were or where they were from I was just ready to catch a body.  I was fighting a guy from their local boxing gym.  He already had one fight under his belt, a victory.  I gave him his first loss.  The fight went all three rounds.  I busted his nose and lip open.  He was leaking on me like a faucet.  By the end of the fight my left arm was drenched in his blood.  It was fucking awesome",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2M0A3TE
