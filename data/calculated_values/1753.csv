It was a lot of fun planning it, and getting in touch with all of his friends without him knowing what I was up to. There were a few times when I thought I'd get caught, but I managed to create clever cover up stories! I threw the party at his favorite local bar/pub, and was in contact with everyone all day about what time to arrive. The best part about the day was trying to ""prep"" my boyfriend for the party without him knowing why I was doing it (it wouldn't have been any fun for him to arrive tired, grumpy, or looking disheveled). To do this, I told him we were meeting his sister there for drinks to discuss her wedding, and that he should try to look nice and we could make a ""date"" out of it. I also urged him to relax and play video games all day, so he'd be well rested and in a good mood when it came time to party. I also started giving him drinks a few hours before the event! After we arrived, we walked over to our table. Everyone was standing around with their backs turned to us, and as soon as he walked in, they all turned around and yelled SURPRISE and HAPPY BIRTHDAY. I've never seen him look so surprised or excited in his life. He was feeling a bit down about turning 30, and said he didn't want to do anything for his birthday, so the fact that friends came from miles away really made him feel special and supported. His mom's generous gift was to cover all of the drinks and food for the event, so everyone could relax and order as much as they wanted without worrying about money or splitting the bill. Many of his friends brought gifts and cards, but it was them driving the distance that made the biggest impact on him. We recently moved to the suburbs for work, and he has been missing hanging out with his city friends, so seeing them all in one place was really special.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFCT32,
