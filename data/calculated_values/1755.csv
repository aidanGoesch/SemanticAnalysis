I always wanted to be the manager of a workplace. I didn't have the specifics as to where but I still knew that for sure. I worked in many places to gain my experience and different areas. I also even did volunteer work about 120 hours worth that is. I then got hired a place that I really wanted to work at It didn't matter the position. I just wanted to be there so they hired me on a entry level role. I picked it up because I had the time and wanted the money. It was a pretty easy job which was good because I just wanted to be there and get to the next level. Sometimes I did things for the managers helping them out with their work when I am free. I did that for months up until I got a call to the office. It was an important meeting in the office. I was finally promoted after four years of neglect and disrespect from other places of employment. Today was my inaugural day of being a manager in charge. I was really excited this is what I worked for.,,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFD3TD
