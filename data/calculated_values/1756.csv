I worked my butt off for 8 months to get promoted in this job. I trained for 6 weeks in all sorts of shifts to get the job down. I opened, closed, and did mid-shifts. I learned how to receive merchandise, do the deposit, prepare products for the next day, and pretty much every thing possible that would come up on a shift. Today they let me do my first close without supervision. I was crazy nervous to get the deposit right. What if it's off? What if I don't arm the store right and the alarm goes off?  What if we get robbed? But I'm glad to know I'm trusted with the day-to-day operations of a retail store and am considered a manager-in-charge. The $3.75/hr pay raise certainly helps. It means a lot because I was lied to when let go of my teaching job, and blacklisted in the university. I couldn't sue because they could retaliate against my wife. I then spent two years at the home improvement store, but they only promote people with criminal records and look down on education. I'm finally able to have a job that could at least set me up for future success.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFD3TD,
