It was hard to see and the streets were flooding and there was a lot of wind.  I was really nervous driving especially since there were so many trees blowing and limbs coming down.  There was also a lot of lightning.  I wasn't sure if I should keep driving or try to find someplace to stop for a while, but all the other cars were still driving so I thought it was ok to keep going.  It was the highway so it seemed safer than smaller local roads.  I was almost home when I saw someone soaked walking on the side of the road.  At first, I felt really bad that I was going to pass this person by because he looked so forlorn.  However, I was nervous about picking someone up because what if they were dangerous.  Also, I wanted to get home as soon as possible.  I don't know what made me stop, but I did and asked the man if he needed a ride.  It turned out to be someone living a few blocks from me.  He didn't want to get in at first and I admit I was nervous, but with all the rain the lightning I tried to convince him it wasn't safe.  He got in and was really wet!  I guess he looked like a businessman so I thought it would be safe.  As I started to drive off, I heard a huge boom and crack!  A tree and lots of branches fell right where my car was and where the man was walking!  It had to be good karma or divine intervention that saved us because we could have been crushed.  This whole experience made me more willing to help others and to reach out because if I were in that same situation, I would want to be helped.  Also, it was just pure luck or some force out there that had me find the man at the right time and drive away at the right moment without getting hit by the tree.  It was a scary even, but it shows that helping others can give you good karma!!",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33
