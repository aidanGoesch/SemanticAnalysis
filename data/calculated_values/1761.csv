It was a pleasant dream that woke me up to a good mood. I made cereal with Nesquik and 2% whole milk. Outside my window I saw kids playing basketball. For lunch time I had a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches and drank it down with a cup of chocolate milk. It was not much of a lunch but it satisfied me. I was nervous leading into the evening for I was invited to an award ceremony for the Big Book Corporation. I wore a nice solid colored tie and full suit and jacket. I arrived to the award ceremony in my blue subaru and sat staring at the announcer as awards were being given out. I was nervous as many people had partners and I went without one. 10 minutes later I heard my name being called. I could not believe it but I had not only been nominated for an award but actually won one! They called me up for the best book written in the romantic book categories. It was incredible. A few pictures were taken with the award and it was stated that I was the first African American to win this award. It was such an honor and this was a night I will never forget. I went home at one in the morning and slept soundly.",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2PHQT3L
