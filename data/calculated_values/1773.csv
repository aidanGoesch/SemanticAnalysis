Let me tell you about the individual that has become a thorn in my side with respect to outdoor lawn maintenance. My mother. Yes, you heard me correctly . About 7 weeks ago she decided  that she had seen enough of the lifeless, non fruit bearing trees that were anything but pleasing to the eye. In my opinion there simply was no rush to have them taken down as they provided shelter for the wildlife. I had noticed many times with in the prior  weeks there were a number of squirrels using them as homes to secure their nest and the  red headed woodpeckers that would come by and have there morning feast of ants, termites ect...    And, if that was not reason enough  I  simply was in no mood to take the trees down as it would require a lot of work and without the proper equipment it would most certainly be a daunting task. After much conversation and pleading my case for the sanctity of the wildlife, the lack of proper equipment the amount of time it would consume to complete the job correctly I was defeated.   My mother would hear no more about it and in fact she took it upon herself to secure the proper equipment. She called  the local rental store and secured not one but three chainsaw. Why three you ask? She was firm in her belief that I would do anything to prevent the squirrels from becoming homeless  even if that meant destroying property.  With much hesitation I went to the rental place picked up the chainsaws and went on my way. With much frustration I stopped by my buddies house and asked for a hand.  The 2 of us began the daunting task of tree removal. With in 6 hours I  cut down all the lifeless trees and secured mothers blessing to provide the wood to my friend as payment for his assistance.  While I am not a huge fan of my mother at the moment I truly feel good knowing my friend and his family will stay warm and dry during the upcoming winter season.",,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTHLQBYX
