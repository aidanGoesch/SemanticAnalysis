We live in such a small world in reality. I attended a book club event and I was shocked to see my friends ex-husband. My friend passed away last year after a sudden accident and they had been married for 10 years but recently got a divorce. The interaction was just awkward but I made the best of the situation. I didn't yell at him or call him out of his name but for a second I thought about hiding his book while he was in the bathroom. Anyways, he acted like nothing had been happening in the last year which made me think he was in denial. He's trying to cope with her death and has turned into a zombie. I was kind of shocked but he looked bad. I asked him how he felt and he responded with a 'I'm Good."" We all know when someone responds to you with those words, they really mean ""Not Good."" Before I left book club I decided to ask him where he was staying. He told me that him and his girlfriend live together in town. I'm glad I know because I will avoid the area. I just want to punch the asshole for not even acknowledging her death. Maybe it's hard for him to talk about. I don't know!",,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR
