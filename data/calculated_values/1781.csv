I had so much fun with them and i can not wait till i get to go back. It was great being able to spend time with them too because i find that to be very rare with them since we all have busy lifestyles. It was really great seeing how another culture lives as well, you get so stuck up in your own culture that you forget about the others that are around. I'm glad i got to see how other people live and understand that not everyone has it as great as i do or that we in America do over all. I loved the people there as well, although i could not understand many of them they were all so very nice and did not have any judgements what so ever which was different for me. I liked Thailand overall and i am excited that got to experince that time and share it with others. I know that i will be making another trip there in the future with other people because i think everyone should expereince that life. Every needs to know how the different world lives and how everything is not easy for everyone. I think it will allow people to not take what they have for granted and to be able to better understand and possibly relate to another culture too. This trip has made me relaize not to take things for granted personally. I sometimes which i had more, but understand now what i have is enough. The amount of freedom they have is great as well they are not confined to doing things one way. I just can't beleive how different the lifestyles are but how amazing they are too. I was also able to teach them things that they did not know. So overall it was a learning xpereince for us both.",,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PJJM8HQ
