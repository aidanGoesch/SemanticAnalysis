I liked to go to different places and enjoy the weather, food and drinks.  The culture of the area is very accepting and friendly and there are a lot of reasons to fall in love with the place.  I spent a lot of time in the area hanging out with my brother and some other members of my family.  I just did typical stuff, like go out at night for drinks and have tours of the countryside during the day.  It was a nice and relaxing atmosphere, so that helped a lot with the style of vacation that we were trying to have.  I slept in one day and found out that some of my party had gone out and ridden an elephant, because that is a possibility in Thailand.  They seemed to have a pretty good time and the pictures that came from the event were good.  I would very much like to go back someday, although I doubt that anyone there remembers me anymore.  It was a nice country and really gave me some new perspectives.  Once we went and saw some giant buddha statues in the countryside.  Another time we went to an old palace and saw some ancient tapestries.  I was intrigued because it is apparent that I know way more about Western history and culture than I do about eastern.  I felt that I could spend my whole life learning about the place and would only scratch the surface.  That was very exciting for me.  It made me feel that the world was still very exciting and that my curiosity could be rewarded.",3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PJJM8HQ,
