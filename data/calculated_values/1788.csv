I was happy,sad,scared and unsure all in one. I would be starting over yet again. It was like i was becoming a new parent. What makes thing scary is doing it alone. My main support system was gone. The grandmother to my children was no more. Every time id became a parent,my mom was there by my sidem welcoming my little one with open arms. The one i needed when no one else was there . was gone. This will be extremely hard. I know that I will cherish these moments as if she were here. I know that she is watching us from heaven. Protecting us as we live our lives. It doesn't make 9t easier though. My new baby will never meet you.",3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PKW8H8C,
