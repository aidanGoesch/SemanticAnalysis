I haden't a clue what the problem could be. I was a bit nervous. After much thought I went ahead and purchased a pregnancy test and took it. Anxiously waiting for the results  my whole world was rocked. It had been 13 years since I was told that I'd never be able to have another child. I was completely confused,terrified,shocked,amazed &a thousand other things. But this time would be much different. I would be all alone. My mother was gone. Due to stage 4 cancer, I'd lost her just 6 months prior. She was my rock. Was this her way of giving me the light at the end of the tunnel so to speak. Only time would tell how this would turn out. Would I be strong enough to do this without her? Or would I just fall apart completely.",3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PKW8H8C,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PKW8H8C
