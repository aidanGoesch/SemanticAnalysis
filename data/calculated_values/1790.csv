She was only four years old, and my only niece, and though she'd been born with some handicaps, and always been sickly, and the whole family knew this could shorten her lifespan, it still came as a shock. We thought, and had good reason to believe, she would live into her teens. My cousin was devastated, of course. I'd only met her a few times, so I wasn't as affected, but I still was. It reminded me of the fact that I'm getting older, she was the first family member of mine who was younger than me, who had died. I flew to the west coast for the funeral a few days later, it was very sad seeing her little body in the casket. The service was short, and nobody had too much to say, perhaps because her life had been so short. Later we went back to my cousin's place, and when some of the older family members left, we got pretty drunk. My cousin told me that losing her was the worst thing he'd ever experienced, that since I didn't have a child myself I couldn't understand, and I tend to agree with him. His wife came down and told him to stop drinking and come to bed, and I said goodnight to him. I sat up for awhile drinking beer and watching television by myself, and I wondered how I would handle the loss of my own child, or if I'd ever even have children of my own. The next day I woke up with a bad hangover, and flew home, and I was glad to be back and not living that situation anymore, at least for the moment. I knew, however, that as I continued to get older, this would happen more and more often. I can't say that I'm looking forward to it.",,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PRRAH8B
