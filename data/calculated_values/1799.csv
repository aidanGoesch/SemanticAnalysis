It was my first time working retail, or overnight, and I was nervous about it.  But I quickly got into the swing of things and felt I was a contributing member of the team.  However, in a cruel twist of fate, on my very first night I was informed by a teammate that the team had learned our overnight positions were being eliminated because the store was transitioning from a 24-hour store to one that closed around midnight.  We would be offered jobs during the day, but our specific overnight jobs were being eliminated.  I was sort of numb learning about this, mostly because I was simply trying to learn my brand-new job and couldn't really put into perspective what it meant to already be losing it.  But the rest of the team were really mad and discontent.  Some of them vowed to stay on, but most of them said they were going to leave the store entirely.  Either they weren't able to take a day job with the store (for whatever reason) or they were going to use the news as an excuse to quit the job because they were upset and didn't like the job anyway.  I decided that I'd wait and see how I felt.  I still had around two months of work left before the last night, so I decided I'd work for a month or so and then make my decision.  I shouldn't decide when I was still so brand new.  Anyway, after maybe 6 weeks I decided I didn't want to stay on.  I liked my coworkers and didn't mind the overnight work, but the day shifts would have different responsibilities and I didn't know many of the people who worked them and I just didn't feel that interested in staying on.  So I just focused on finishing up my remaining shifts.  During that time I felt I got quite close and comfortable with my coworkers.  It was a tight-knit, small group that worked in close quarters, so it was easy to get familiar with people.  On the last night I think we all felt it was bittersweet.  Most of us were leaving, and felt liberated by that fact.  But we were sad to see the last of each other.  We all laughed and joked during our final break together that we should stock the very last item as a team.  Then someone joked that the last person would drop it and we all laughed.  At the end of the night we met in the breakroom and said our final goodbyes.  It was poignant, for me at least.  We shook hands, said how much it was a pleasure to work together, and finally went our separate ways.",3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRKIGMLL,
