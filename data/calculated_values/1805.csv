I was asleep, and my dog, Sassy, was sleeping next to me. It is August, and she has terrible allergies this time of year, making her very itchy. She woke up in the middle of the night very itchy, and was furiously scratching. It was making her collar jingle, and also she was bumping up against me as she scratched. I was having a hard time going back to sleep, because she was so itchy and scratching so much. I am a massage therapist, and am very interested in how the nervous system, emotions, and physical feelings are connected. I was thinking about this, and Sassy's problem- and I decided, as an LMT, to try to activate her parasympathetic nervous system, to see if it would calm her and her itchiness. I slowly and gently began to massage her, and she instantly relaxed and stopped scratching. I continued massaging gently, and rubbing her tummy, and she continued relaxing. I did this for about 20 minutes, and she had fallen comfortably asleep. It made me feel really, really good that I could help her, and comfort her enough to help her sleep....and also so that I could sleep! I felt good about my scientific theory, as well as my instincts as a dog mama. We have had several sleepless nights lately, due to her allergies and uncomfortableness. I am hoping that it will work if I try it again, and that I may have found a drug-free solution for my miserable pup!",,3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRS2JML0
