I couldn't wait to go. It is somewhere I have always wanted to see. After a long plane ride, I had very high expectations of the country, however, those were shattered pretty quickly. After getting off the plane, I had trouble with entry. They didn't think the picture on my passport looked like me. So I stood there arguing with them for a good 20 mins. Finally after that headache, they let me know. The first night I was there, I was walking around trying to find a place to eat, and a salesperson approached me. He never left me be. I was scared because he started to follow me to the restaurant. Once in the restaurant I looked back and he seemed to have left, but I made a note to try and eat as long as I can so when I left he wouldn't be there again. The second night, I was walking about a park and this little girl came up to me. She looked at me intently and I tried to ask her if everything was ok. I guess she didn't know what I was saying because she smiled, looked at my hand and grabbed it. When I tried to take her hand away from mine, her grip got tighter. Looking around for her parents, I didn't see anything. Finally, grabbing hard without hurting her I got her hand loose and quickly walked away. Since I was here a week, the day before I left, I got ripped off. I handed some money to a merchant after I bought a neat necklace, and wasn't handed any change back. I figured I miscalculated and moved on. At the next place, the same thing happened. At this point, I realized they were stealing from me. I felt so stupid, yet I was afraid to do anything.",,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD
