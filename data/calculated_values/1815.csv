I took real estate classes at my local community college. I studied an entire summer for the board exam. I failed once. On my second try, I passed. I was so excited. I interview at a few different brokerages and landed a position at a great brokerage not to far from my home.  The first 6 months were very hard. I trained under another real estate agent.  I was able to sell a few homes my first year.  My second year was better. Slowly I started to create a business for myself.  Just when I thought I was doing well, the stock market crashed.  The real estate industry was in trouble. Many people lost their homes. I had to find a part time job to make ends meet.  Within a year they asked me to join them full-time. I am so grateful for this opportunity. After years of a sketchy real estate market, I decided to quit and just work my full-time job where I have full benefits. Things have been going well ever sense. In a way, I'm glad the market crashed.",,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08JYXHCH
