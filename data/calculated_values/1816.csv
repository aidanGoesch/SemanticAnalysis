I've been trying to grow sugar maples in tissue culture for three years and have not had much success. In May, I was able to get three times the number of plants to survive than I've had in the last two years. These plants that have survived have continued to survive and I've been able to experiment on them with different media components and hormone concentrations to get some of these plants to root. The plants need to have roots to really thrive and without them, they can't live for very long. Last month I was able to find a hormone concentration that is starting to stimulate root production. This is very exciting and gives me a lot of satisfaction because there wasn't much information in the published literature to use as a guide. I had to take information from different plant species and come up with my own concentrations and trials. In science, we have a lot of frustration. We have to constantly repeat experiments and come up with new ideas. It's fun and challenging but it also comes with stress and frustration. We have a grant for this work, so it's been tough to have this project not work well. If we need to reapply for additional funding, it would be tough to justify it for a project that's not working. The maple trees I'm working with are higher sugar producing tress that are valuable for maple sugar growers as they get better syrup from the sap of those trees. With increasing insect pests that destroy these trees, it's important to have a tissue culture source of the trees. I really enjoy when I can get a project to work. I love to figure things out and it gives me lots of satisfaction when I can get things to work.",,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08JYXHCH
