First of all, you have to get your ingredients together. Typically vape e liquid consists of vegetable glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine and, flavoring. So, i easily buy my propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG) from amazon for almost dirt cheap. These two bottles will cost you about 15 dollars. Then, you will have to buy some nicotine and flavoring from a seperate website for about 10 dollars each. With these four bottles you are pretty much set for the whole year to make as much juice as you want. And this is why there are so many vape shops popping up sound your city. It's because anyone can slap a label on to a bottle and call it their own. Theres hundreds of thousands of different brands out there and a ton of flavors. Also, you can find the recipes for your favorite blend/brand online and make a clone version of your favorite juice. So, i've been doing this for a about a year or so now and it has saved me so much money. I used to buy 20 dollar bottles every other day. But now i make my own. I don't see why i haven't thought of this earlier. I should have put two and two together when i ""vaping"" started to be a popular way to quit cigarettes. Then all the vape stores popped up- putting their own labels on a bottle that will cost you around 1 dollar to make yet they will charge you 20 dollars in their store. it's ridiculous.",31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFOKCO3H,
