I went downtown with a friend to go see his new office, yeah? It's in a pretty decent part of town, but for some reason there's homeless people everywhere! On the corners, on bus stops, everywhere! You can't go three steps without seeing another one! One of them had even parked himself on the office doorway! He had his food out and was eating and looked like it'd take him a while to get done, too. My friend tried to shimmy past him, but the guy got real upset about being ""interrupted"" or whatever, like, dude, go eat on a park bench or something! My friend got into an argument with him about the whole thing, too. That really just made things worse, though. The man got really really really angry and started growling at us! He abandoned his food, grabbed rocks from the little...little garden thing by the door and started chasing us with them! We barely got back to the car in time before he'd have pelted us both! Before I could get in the car, though, he nailed me on the back of the head! My friend had to take me to the clinic to get stitched. And of course, I couldn't even press charges because the guy was gone. What a mess...",,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K09HCY
