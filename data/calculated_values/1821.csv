The area is becoming more and more inundated by homeless people. My friend was excited to show me the office as we parked in the building's driveway and did a brief tour just after sunset. As we were backing out of the driveway, we observed a homeless man sitting on the front porch of my friend's office and he was eating a sandwich, tossing his wrappers all over the porch. My friend was annoyed, rolled down his car window and hollered to the homeless man, ""Please pick up your trash when you're through, buddy."" As we proceeded to back out of the driveway, the homeless man jumped up and ran after us. He approached my friend's driver-side window which was still partially lowered, as if to start a conversation. The homeless man threw a handful of rocks right at my friend's head. Just as my friend pulled back, the rocks flew across the front seat of the car and struck me on the knee and hand. The sharp edges cut my skin and I was bleeding some. I yelled at my friend, ""Just get out of here!"" As my friend backed hurriedly out of the driveway, we looked in the rear view mirror and the homeless man was still running down the street, chasing us, throwing rocks at our car! When we reached a red stoplight, the man caught up to us. My friend lowered his window again, enough to take a photo of the man. I was angry at my friend for lowering the window for any reason, and again hollered, ""Just get out of here!"" I was so horrified by the event that I swore I would never to to my friend's office again. My friend continued to do business at his new location, but now, he always carries a weapon. I cautioned him to always have his head on a swivel, be on the lookout and  never arrive or leave alone, espeically after dark.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K09HCY,
