That turned out to be a mistake that cost me financially and emotionally. Upon my return, I submitted resumes to several firms that appealed to me. I was unsuccessful. Ten job applications, led to ten rejections. I was starting to get desperate. My finances were getting critical. I was forced to take any job I could find. I took a job sweeping floors and cleaning offices at night just to make ends meet. I was barely getting by and that took its toll in my life. My significant other, whom I was in love with and hoped to marry, left me. My life was in shambles. Desperate to find a job I liked and one that would fulfill my dreams, I kept on submitting job applications to every firm that was hiring. My losing streak continued and I began to think there was something wrong with me. Perhaps my persona just broadcast failure. Was I doomed? I was at the end of my rope money-wise and psychologically as well, when I got a call back on a job application. They wanted to interview me! It was for an entry level engineering position, and at this point it seemed to good to be true. I went to my interview and was told I would be hearing from them! I got the job! I love it! Life is returning to normal, and the future looks bright. And as a side perk, I met a woman that works there and we have been dating. Things are looking up!",,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08TX7HCZ
