I usually buy my e-juice from the vape store but, i found out recently that you can make it yourself. It is rather cheap compared to buying a 20 dollar bottle in the store. It costs me about one to two dollars to make a 30ml bottle of vape liquid. I also find it pretty healthier compared to smoking cigarettes as, i know what i'm vaping. It's only four ingredients (PF, VG, nicotine, and concentrated flavor) compared to whatever is inside cigarettes. Not only does mixing up a batch of this stuff save me time and money, i enjoy doing it. I was just so surprised that i haven't heard of other people doing the DIY ejuice making. So, this was a striking realization.  It's fun to browse all the flavors that you can mix/make. Now i know why there are so many vape shops opening everywhere, it's because people are buying these 20 dollar bottles and it's highly profitable to the owners but, little do the the customers know it's just a simple blend of 4 ingredients. Propylene Glycol, Vegetable Glycol, Nicotine, and Artificial flavoring. Now i don't know about you but, i think that sounds much more healthier in comparison to standard cigarettes. These days you never know what kind of stuff is put into cigarettes. I once heard there was rocket fuel added.",31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFOKCO3H,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFOKCO3H
