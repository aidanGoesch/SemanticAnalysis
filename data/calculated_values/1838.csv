I could not believe what happened, it just came out of nowhere and hit me in the head like a brick. I love her to death, but man if she does not get on my NERVES! UGH! Ok, so we had been doing our thing, going to the park and collecting shark teeth as normal. Well come to find out the beach we goto for our shark teeth - has a rule against it and the not so nice Park Ranger made sure to inform us that we broke the law and had to dump our teeth out. Fine whatever, it happens right? No instead she goes ahead and drops about 25 teeth into her brazier and is like what teeth ""Ranger Rick"" with such a smug attitude. This Ranger has no joke ability or something and immediately arrests her! A few minutes go by before I could convince her to drop the stupid teeth so we can just bail without anyone going to jail. She agree's but I could tell she was so mad. Our Ranger does let her go, but we get fined for it. Fast forward about an hour and we are headed to the other beach in town to just cruise the golf cart around and enjoy the soon to be evening. It seems like the troubles from earlier are behind us and we plan to have a good night. Well, apparently she had smuggled some of those teeth out when she admitted to me she had them on her person now. Score! Add those suckers to our collection, or so I thought. We get close enough to the restaurant on the beach to start hearing the live band playing and people generally enjoying their evenings. While we are admiring our teeth at an outside table surrounded by people, good ole Ranger Rick comes up from the shadows it seems and barks out ""You still broke the law after I let you go."" Yes, yes we did Ranger Rick and there is nothing you can do about it now. Which was not true, he barred us from the park and I lost my connection to some awesome shark teeth.",,3A9AA95ATX8H1WLQH4KRXNWPD9CP5F
