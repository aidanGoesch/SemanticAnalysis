For the longest time, all I cared about was work. Even when I was at home, I thought about work and money. I don't know where I got it from, because my mom and dad weren't workaholics, nor were my grandparents. My grandpa has actually talked to me about how I need to cool it with the work 'addiction'. I've always been close with him. I grew up with him and saw him at least a few times a month. Four months ago, he had a heart attack and died. I hadn't seen him for almost a month prior to this, so I felt extremely sad and guilty. He was a very happy man and put family over everything. His death made me realize that it is important to live like he did, not obsess over work like I did. I need to enjoy life, take his advice and stop working so much. Since he died four months ago, I have spent more time with family that I have in the past 3 years. I have taken them to dinner, they have cooked for me, we have gone to the movies, etc. I have had a lot of fun. I hope to make more memories with my friends and family in the coming years in honor of my grandpa.",,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP723OX
