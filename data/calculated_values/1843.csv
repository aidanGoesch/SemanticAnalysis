When I was pulling into the parking lot, I noticed an old woman who looked like she was dressed as a character from game of thrones, walking in the entrance. I parked and got out of my car to head in. When I got in, I grabbed a cart and headed to the breakfast isle. When I turned the corner, I saw the old woman again. She was trying to grab a thing of oatmeal off of the top shelf and could not reach it. Since I am pretty tall and have no problem reaching that high I asked her did she need any help. She said that was very kind of me as I grabbed the box down for her. She noticed the way that I was looking at her outfit and chuckled at me. She then told me that I probably thought that she was crazy because of the way she was dressed. I then told here that it was a very unusual outfit to go shopping for groceries in. She then told me that her son had died last year and his favorite thing to do was go larping. After he died, she joined his group to pay homage for him. She said that she was running a little late today because she had to come pick up food for the picnic that they always have after a battle. I told her that I am sure her son would be happy that she was doing it. She then proceeded to invite me to come join her today. That was three months ago and I am proud to say that I am now being inducted into the group this afternoon, all thanks to a box of oatmeal and a sweet old lady.",,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH858LZJ1
