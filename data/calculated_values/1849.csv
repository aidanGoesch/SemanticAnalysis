I'd been waitlisted when I applied to my school's PhD program, which was an incredible bummer. I was having my usual breakfast-eggs, toast, coffee-and my mom walked in the room. She handed me a letter from the school. I sat it aside because I figured it was something annoying that I could handle later. Turns out I apparently can't help myself so I picked it back up and opened it. I could not believe what I was reading...I HAD GOTTEN INTO THE PHD PROGRAM! I wasn't waitlisted! I was actually going to get the chance to make my dreams come true! I screamed so loud that I scared my mom! She ran into the room yelling ""Are you okay?!? What happened?!?"". By then I was blubbering tears of absolute joy. I said ""Mom I got it! I got into the PhD program!"". She screamed then! She started crying, too. It was the happiest day of my life!",,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH86BCZJZ
