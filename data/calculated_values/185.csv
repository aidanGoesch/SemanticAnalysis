He had been ill with dementia and physically deteriorating for a while but I still wasn't prepared to lose him. He was mentally declining and most of the time he would just sit in his chair and go in and out of a mental fugue state. The last time I saw him was six days before he died. He was already in hospice care and depressed. I showed him a picture of my newborn son and we talked about baseball. It was his favorite sport and he loved to watch the Detroit Tigers. He was very lucid and aware. He talked to me about how much he still missed Verlander since the trade and that he hoped the Tigers would have a good year despite losing so many players. He then told me that my baby looked like my wife. It was a very emotional day. His death really taught me to appreciate every moment of every day. I had spent so much of my time rushing through life that I never bothered to consider that it will eventually end. There will be some people who will really miss me after I am gone. I inherited money from his estate and invested the bulk of it. One of my most fond, recurring, memories from when I was a child was going to my grandparents lake cottage and spending weekends and vacations there. To honor my grandfather and provide my own children that kind of experience I purchased a cottage this summer, on a lake about an hour and a half drive away. On weekends we all go up there and relax. My daughter loves the beach and just sitting out in the shady yard. My little one is scooting around the place pretty good and likes to go sit under an umbrella and play in the sand. Every time I am there I think about my grandfather and wish so very, very much that he could be there to enjoy this with us. At times it feels like he is there. I firmly intend to instill all the values that I learned from him over the years. He was a good man, a simple man, and he was always looking for the sun after the rain.",,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP723OX
