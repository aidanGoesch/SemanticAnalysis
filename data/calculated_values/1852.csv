Not only did God help us overcome a number of financial obstacles we experienced in purchasing the house, but God went even further and provided new furniture.   When we started looking for homes, everything was out of our price range.  The only thing we could afford were condominiums.   But we wanted a yard for our dogs, so that meant we needed a house with a yard.  We were getting a little depressed about our lack of options, but things soon changed.  We decided to go to a gospel retreat to lift our spirits.  While there, one of the ministers told us about this developer who had one home left in a new subdivision.  So, we immediately contacted the developer.  He told us that he would reduce the price of the home if we closed right away.  We had advance loan approval from our bank, but still needed another $10,000 for the down payment.  As it turned out, there was a charity raffle at the retreat and God intervened and made sure we won the prize, which was exactly what we needed--$10,000. So we had our financing in place and then came the free furniture!  We were in desperate need of furniture, but used every penny we had for the down payment.  Fortunately for us, the home we bought was the model home for the new subdivision.  Since we needed furniture, God moved the developer to throw in all the new display furniture for free.  God is good!",,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH8FA6ZJ0
