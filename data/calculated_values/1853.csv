My husband and I just closed on our own home. We had our own house before, but we lost it in 2011. We had owned it for 11 years and my husband got disabled on the job. It was awful because we are both disabled because of back issues and surgeries and deal with chronic pain. This house we got is better than the one we lost! It is amazing! It has beautiful granite countertops, slate floors, a swimming pool and a spa like bathroom. The best part is, it is 20% less rent than a run down house we were renting! I even got much needed new furniture last week that was severely needed. Now, I can tell you, it was a miracle- God did it ALL! It was so sad eight years ago moving 450 miles from home because we couldn't afford to live there anymore. This place is great and I am really happy. The furniture is so comfortable and I am looking forward to decorating it some more.  It's never too late for things to get better- nothing is too hard for God.",,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH8FA6ZJ0
