I have been contacted by some fraternities on campus and been to a few parties.  These interactions have made my time here more fun and I feel like I can do things on my own.  I still talk to my family every day and let them know about my classes and night time activities and they have been very supportive.  I thought it would be weird being out on my own, but I have found it to be refreshing and fun to do things on my own or with other kids my own age.  Being 18 is cool because I can finally be considered an adult and i like to be independent and old enough to be accountable.  I miss my family and having the support there to have things like laundry and money and food at my disposal, but I am feeling better about myself when I do things on my own.  It did take a full 2 weeks for me to get settled in my new college dorm life environment and I am glad I met some cool people and have great roommates.  I have another friend here who is in a quad and she doesn't talk to any of them at all.  So weird to be in a room with 3 other people and never hang out or do anything with them.  Seems too strange and uncomfortable to be in a quad like that and not socialize with them.  This is significant because I remember going to college right out of high school and I felt that I wasn't ready.  i tried to convince my parent to take a gap year but they weren't having it or would not even consider letting me do that.  My daughter just went to college 2 weeks ago and she has adjusted well.  I can tell she misses home but she is only 2 hours away and we have seen her once already since she left.  I love that she is taking this better than I did and she actually seems bored because she is so organized.  I feel she deserves a bigger challenge than she is seeing now but I am sure as she progresses at school she can take on more than she has curently.  Feeling very rpud and scared at the same time.",,3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0C7LJHTO
