I am always nervous when I get reviewed at work.  Today was no exception.  I knew everyone was getting their projects reviewed.  The best one would be selected to be implemented by the boss.  That meant that the winner would be in charge of a team leading the project.  I wanted this very badly.  I have been working  here for 6 months and wanted a chance to show my leadership ability as well as my creativity.  The boss brought everyone in the conference room to announce the results.  There were many amazing project ideas. I was so excited when I found out that mine had won!  It was very rewarding after all the hard work that I put into it.  I am happy to be able to be noticed for my hard work.  Hopefully, this will only propel me forward at work.  I can't wait to share the news with my family!",,3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CYA8HTI
