My problem was I had social anxiety so over course of 1 o 2 years I am gradually overcame my problem, without the help of any therapist. I believed in myself. I don't need anyone else's acceptance of me need to accept. I m mostly  don't care about what other people think. hen you start and finish my presentation in a breeze,I am imagine myself being the most confident speaker during your presentations and meetings. this is where the core of my problem lies, A fear of public speaking is often  related with social anxiety and being afraid what others think, dislike being the center of attention being judged etc. the way I can beat this is firstly by believing .then reassure myself because i am going to be completely else or to present their own representations. I used to be petrified of speaking in public. once i improved I used to be petrified speaking in public. I started raising my hand o speak as often as possible. I developed a workshop. which I use o train people on how to become more comfortable mastering the skill of communicating effectively. The quick tip for today is all about structure. A lack of structure often causes a speaker to get  nervous and perform poorly. Having a clear structure accomplishes two things.  you hardly ever forget what you want to say and You give he audience a great way to stay engaged the entire time. I also know exactly where i am in the presentation and never have to worry about losing my train and thought.",3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CYA8HTI,
