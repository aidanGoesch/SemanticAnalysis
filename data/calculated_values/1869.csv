That warmth of a winter's day.  Even if I am alone, early on a winter's morning, about 6 AM, the sun just starting to sends its rays enough so that the black becomes more a grey blue while the temp outside is significantly low to the warmth on my stocking feet meant home.  The house had a fire about two years after we moved to where we lived when I was a teen.  No doubt that floor furnace has been replaced with central heat and one is wrapped around with that same heat.  And that's what would be missing.  Concentrated on just the soles of the feet, it moves up and warm you like a blanket you see coming and know more comfort will soon arrive.  Now, in California, I have to place where I can ""rest my feet.""  It's warm all the time.  Why is that so bad?  It isn't really.  But without something to trigger warmth, you take the place for granted.  Mind you, Southern California is great in the winter.   You have no ""cold,"" even though the temps might drop.  But you don't have home.  Everyone needs a furnace.  So do I now.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB2CGPN7
