He actually never made we feel lonely even after my brutal break up with my ex. i grow up to actually love hero a lot.  Everyone absolutely love hero cause he wasn't   mean. hero is the most friendly animal i have ever come across.  Hero is actually the best pet in the whole of his history. About  6 weeks ago hero wasn't always as active as he used to be at first i wasn't really bothered, i thought maybe it was his mood or something. then his visual action was really getting serious. It was like his eyes are always closed anytime he is working, always breaking stuffs, having  unnecessary injuries. At this point i was always trying to be cool with it until it got to the peak i couldn't contain it no more. i finally decided to see a ""vet"" doctor. AT this point i was really scared of what is going on with hero. The doctor examine him and founded out he had benign. i really didn't know what it meant at first. The was really too unfamiliar didn't know what to think.  later, the doctor explain to me and i realized hero's illness wasn't as bad as i thought. the doctor gave hero some medicate and ever since his sight has improved a lot more",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB36DPNT
