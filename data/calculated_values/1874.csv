I realized that I soon had to catch the bus, so i stopped and waited at the bus stop. At the bus stop, i met a man named Casey. Casey was a young homeless man. After talking to him, I had great pity on him. Casey lost everything in the financial crisis, and he had no family left. After talking to him for a while, I realized I had to do something. I offered Casey money, but he would not take any. I decided I should invite him back to my place. I live alone after all. I told Casey he could sleep on my couch that night if he would like to. Casey came back to my house, ad we watched Netflix for a good while. As he shared more about his story, I felt my entire life perspective change. I realized that i took so many things for granted. I told Casey that he had changed my life in that moment. To this day, Casey and I are close friends.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5V3PNZ
