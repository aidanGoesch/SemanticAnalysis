I can't sleep. All I can do is lay here and think. I go over and over in my head, every memory I have of my Pa. The good memories and the not so good memories. I think about how he adopted me and treated me as his own. I think about the movies we watched together and the days spent outside. I don't think about how I won't see him again or hear his voice. I don't think about how hard it will be to get over his death. I don't think about this because I don't need to. I can feel the loss and sorrow in my heart. The man who raised me is gone. I knew he was getting older and this was inevitable, but I am still not prepared. I worry that I didn't tell him that I love him as many times as I should've. I worry that he didn't know how much he meant to me. All I hope is that he knew and that his death was quick.",3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5WVNPR,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5WVNPR
