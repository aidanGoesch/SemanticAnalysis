It is because of the issues related to the property sale of our old home. The clash went so bad that one of my uncle told a truth suddenly. The truth was that the man I believed to be my grandfather is not. Everyone was stunned a moment. He said that my grandfather was not my genetic relative. I argued that that cannot be true. But my uncle was confident in his argument. Immediately I argued that I will prove it. I decided to take DNA test for my grandfather. I took his blood sample to the trusted hospital nearby and the test was conducted. From the result I got to know that he was not my biological relative. Hence I decided to use my mother's DNA to find who is my grandfather. It was really shocking to know that he is not my grandfather from the result. I am on the steps now to find my biological grandfather.,,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBEQ5PN0
