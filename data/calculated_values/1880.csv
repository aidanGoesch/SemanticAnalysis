I had a DNA test done and one of my mother's sibling come as as only being half related to me. I then discovered that my grandmother had relations with someone else. I was not expecting this at all. My grandmother never alluded to such a thing. I doubt she even knew for sure that my mom was not my thought-to-be grandfather's. He died when my mother was about 5. My mother knew of a man that she saw around her house when she was young that my grandmother had relations with. It was from that provided identity that I explored the tree's of some of my closest DNA connections. I found the same surname of the man in a few of their trees. This lead to me figure that he must be my grandfather. I connected with one of my closest DNA relatives to ask some questions. He also did not know who his grandfather is, and we suspect that his grandfather is my mother's father. His father discovered that his father was no who he always though it was after he took one. The man we believe we are both related to died in 1993 and had no children with any of his wives, so there really isn't anyone to test against to receive an answer of absolute certainty. I am pretty sure the man my mom identified is my grandfather as well as his. We are currently working on figuring this out. He is genetically my half cousin I believe. That is my best guess from the amount of DNA we share. I am trying to help the other guy confirm who his grandfather is. I think it is the same as mine, but he thinks it could be him or his brother.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBEQ5PN0
