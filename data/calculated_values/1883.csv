After nine long months of waiting to meet my daughter, I got to hold my baby girl in my arms today.  I was so scared to go through another c-section.  At least this time it was planned and not an emergency.  The spinal block was awful, I thought I was going to be sick.  I'm so tired but I'll never be able to sleep.  I can't get enough of that beautiful little face.  I'm worried about how her brother is going to handle having a baby in the house.  He didn't seem to be too happy when he met her.  It could be because I'm not home too, change is always hard for a toddler.  I knew he wasn't going to be thrilled, but he actually bit her head.  Not even 24 hours old and she already has a sibling injury.  I thought he was going to kiss her, but I was mistaken.  I'm going to have to make sure he gets enough attention.  My heart is so full.  I think being a mom is probably the best thing in the world.   I am worried about how hard it will be to have two little ones but I guess it will come with time.",3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0
