My house is already sold and we are currently staying with my grandmother who is also leaving vegas from all of the emotional deaths in the family. Her house is currently on the market and we have to be out of here by nov 3rd. Our new home is ready for us when we get there. its very nice and im pleased with the outcome. it even has solar panel hook ups. We have just about wrapped up everything we need to wrap up. Some of the last things we have to do is go to some doctor follow up appointments and see if we can get some type of recommendations for doctors in California. Then just for good measure i went and got an extension on my medications for 60 days. It took a little effort but they were sympathetic. I spent last night drinking beer with my brother and reminiscing about our mother. We had a good time i drink way to much than i should have but it was worse it.  Then later that night when i was laying in bed I got a phone call  from my other (he took my moms dog)  brother who told me that my moms dog died that night. i took it hard because it was my moms dog and i felt like it was kinda like the last part of her is gone.,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z01G6OP,
