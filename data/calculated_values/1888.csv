This event in my life was particularly significant as I never once thought I would be in a graduate program. I'm someone who hated school throughout my K-12 years as well as my undergraduate degree. I always struggled to focus and be motivated to achieve good grades. Going to graduate school was a last minute decision for me, because I felt inspired by a mentor I acquired during my undergraduate program to pursue work in Higher Education. This mentor made a huge impact on my life, and they truly are the reason I was able to get through an undergraduate program. I kept in contact with my mentor throughout my graduate program. I let them know about the great times and the terrible ones. I still struggled throughout graduate school to stay motivated, but I felt significant that I was finally studying something that felt relevant to me. Coming up on graduation, my mentor apologized and let me know that they would be unable to attend my graduation. I understood as it was across the country and it would have been difficult to expect their attendance. However, graduation this year was impactful for me as my mentor surprised me at my ceremony, and handed me my diploma. They were not a faculty member of the program, but they were able to work out a deal in which they could be one of the first to congratulate me on my accomplishments. This was so heartwarming that they made the effort to surprise me, and go the extra mile in ensuring I knew they were there for me. They were always there for me.",,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z9UUO6G
