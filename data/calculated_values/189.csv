The most memorable part of this is the way he acted after the abuse each time. He would apologize like he had done something minor, like forgetting to read me a bedtime story. He just acted like what happened was something that he could apologize and move on from. I will never forget the way he dismissed his own behavior. However, his behavior ended up ruining mine and my siblings' lives. I fear that if I ever see him again or that if he has more children in the future, the abuse will continue once more. I hope that he does not remarry a woman that has children of her own as well. I fear that if he becomes involved with a wife or other children, he will abuse them as well. The abuse has been significant to my life because it has led to a chain of events that have landed me in foster care. After a teacher noticed the bruises, she told officials. Officials investigated the situation of my home life and immediately determined that I was not safe at home with my father. Since my mother is not in the picture, I was placed immediately into foster care. This did not only affect me, however. My siblings were abused and place into foster care as well. We were placed with different foster families and I have not seen my sibling since. I miss my siblings, and as much as my home was an unhappy place, I miss having a home to call my own. I feel that I have no one in the world that truly knows me or that I can depend on. I just feel very alone. It is hard for me to talk about anyone about this since it is a very personal experience that only a few other that have been through it can understand. It helps a little bit to write out my feelings in this diary, but it is not the same as talking to a trusted person that understands how I feel. The actions of my father have changed my life for the worse. I have lost my family and my home. I do not feel safe anymore since he started abusing me and my siblings. It effected me physically during the actual abuse, but it will effect me mentally for the rest of my life.",,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP8Q3ON
