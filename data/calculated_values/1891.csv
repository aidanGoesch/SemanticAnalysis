I was worried about the legacy I would leave behind. So many people dont want to take risks, or try to avoid failure. Blaming others for the faults and serving only themselves. It will lead to a life of 1000 regrets. So I decided to do something about it. I always dreamed of owning something. I wasnt sure what I wanted to own but I wanted to be in charge. I love making art, so I rented a space and started making art. I learned that many people like making art but dont have the space or supplies. Thats where I come in. I started hosting 3 night a week classes and events. We do wine and pottery, tye dye shirts for kids, and free form art. My business has really taken off. The rent is easily covered by just one week of classes, and the rest goes to me or supplies. I have enjoyed stepping out of my comfort zone. It isnt about failing but rather trying to follow your passions. I am so happy i had that realization. Instead of being a cynic and following the crowd I branched off. I am much happier now because of this. Don't let your dreams be dreams.",,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5ZZYX6OZ
