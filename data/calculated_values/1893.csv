I have had it mind to proceed to attain a Masters in Petroleum Geology before hunting for jobs. I have always wanted to work with Exxon Mobil after I had a project assigned to my department in my third year of which I was a part of. I had Mturk and Web development as my main hustle pending the time I get enough money to go for my Masters. Exxon Mobil had an opening some 8 months ago. I applied just like everyone even though my plan was to get a job after my masters. During the application process, I was asked to write a motivation letter. It was through the writing that I changed my mind that I didn't even have to wait to have a Master's degree before I land my dream job. I wrote the letter to the best of my ability highlighting how I want to change the world by working for Exxon Mobil. Luckily for me, I was invited for the next stage of the interview process; an aptitude test. I aced that easily as it was something I loved practicing on when I am less busy. About 2 weeks later, I was invited for a further interview. At this stage, it was getting serious and I really didn't want to lose this one. I put in my very best in the oral and technical session of the interview. It came in like a bomb when 4 months ago, I heard a ping on my laptop. It was a mail!!! I checked it and boom, it was from Exxon Mobil. They invited me for a negotiation. That same week, I was handed my appointment letter and I was given some huge sum of money even before I started work with them. I relocated as my work location is not in my state.  It was a dream come true and the memories will remain evergreen.",,3AQF3RZ55941TNWA8KYRDZWL6AOF6T
