I went with my college friends where we are an gang of around 16 persons. We have decided to visit Mount Everest in our college days itself but we can't able to achieve our dream. One of friend has planned to visit Mount Everest with his Uncle's trip planning in the summer days in that location. He informed about that plan to all our friends. I suddenly surprised and excited very much that too enjoying with our friends.  It was an additional enjoyment after a long time engaging outdoor with my friends.  I immediately said OK and day dream about climbing Mount Everest. We planned about our mountaineering and things to be packed. We planned in group about our plan schedule. Finally we got ready to be climb the Everest. We reached the destination place and it was awesome to see the Giant Mount Everest live. My life got fulfilled and I felt like I am an achiever. The moment I saw the Everest was an unimaginable scene I have saw on the Earth. I climbed with my friends with full fun and enjoyment. We stayed in tent then and there and we shared our feelings and emotions. We took more photos and uploaded in our social media. It gives goose bumps when I completed my achievement and came home with lot of pleasure and fulfillment.,3AQF3RZ55941TNWA8KYRDZWL6AOF6T,
