I decided to start learning the language. I went to classes for 2 years. However I wasn't making as much progress as I had hoped. I decided to go to Japan as a foreign exchange student. It was a tough decision. My family was a bit worried about me. I had to do it though. There was just something inside of me that told me this was a once in a lifetime opportunity. I stayed with a really nice family there.  There was a mother and father and they had three young boys. I really enjoyed my time with them. It was amazing being a part of their culture. I loved my time with them. I wish I could go and visit them again one day.,,3AQF3RZ55941TNWA8KYRDZWL7ZI6FT
