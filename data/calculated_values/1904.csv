We placed it on the end table and patiently awaited him to get home from school. Shortly later he arrived and we hesitated to tell him that he received a letter. We all gathered around and opened the letter together. It had stated that he was accepted to the state university starting at the begging of the year. Everyone was thrilled about this but deep down inside me I felt hurt. I was loosing my baby, the one my husband and I taught everything he knows. We knew this meant he was going to be moving out on his own for the very first time and it scared us a bit because he has never been out there on his own. We saved as much money as we could but we don't make much because neither of us went to college ourselves. We tried to prepare him for everything that we could but deep down we know it is now on him to make the right decisions and continue to work hard at everything he does. I will no longer be able to pack him a lunch for school or make him a home cooked meal for him when hes felling down. My husband and I know this is for the best and that we will see him soon knowing that he is only a few hours away but it still saddens us to see our firstborn leaving the nest. The day he left was the hardest. We looked at his car that packed to the rim with all of his belongings. We thought said to ourselves the night before, we will not cry and make this as easy as possible. But sure enough there I stood holding my son with a tear in my eye know that we will now be sending him off on his own.",,3ATPCQ38J9W8GGP83N7RIP5N7AJYAP
