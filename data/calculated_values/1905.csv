As of Monday, my oldest son is back in our home, living with us full time. This has been very stressful for myself, and though he doesn't say it, I know it is disappointing and stressful on my husband as well.  We have been enjoying stability in our home and days where we can simply enjoy being together without having to take care of anyone else. Although my son is 21, and legally an adult, he is very immature and selfish. It's a nightmare having him here again, as an adult. His work shifts have been drastically decreased right now, as he works as a dishwasher in a restaurant here in town -- a town that is very touristy for about 8 out of 12 months a year. Winter is notoriously slow for the industry and while I believe my son should've planned for this and saved his money to be able to afford his rent, he did not do that. So here were are. He is hardly working, not paying a dime to live with us, expects us to care for all of his needs and desires (demands). He still thinks I will wash his dirty laundry and provide all his meals! Maybe I sound callous. Maybe I am. But it's like living with the world's worst roommate... and I should say, I had my fair share of terrible college roommates! Perhaps he will get his act together, find another job that pays enough that he can afford his own place. For now I am not holding my breath.",3ATPCQ38J9W8GGP83N7RIP5N7AJYAP,
