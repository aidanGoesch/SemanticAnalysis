This has been something my husband and I have both been looking forward to. He's 21 and still relies on our support for an extensive number of things. I know that this was harder on my husband than on myself. However, I think it's an absolute crucial step in him learning some independence and growing up. For the majority of his life, he's not been responsible. This move was on his own accord though, which I think is important if it's a situation that he'll continue to stick through. He and his girlfriend didn't enlist our help at all in moving his stuff out of our house, or into their new apartment. I was quite surprised by this, but excited at the prospect of him taking on the situation. Thus far it has been enjoyable having our own space to ourselves, without an irresponsible adult ""child"" living here with us. I hope that he will maintain the living situation for himself, including saving his paychecks to cover his own rent and bills. Thus far it appears that this is the case. On the day he moved out, my husband and I actually had plans to have come some company over for dinner. We didn't know that they had secured the apartment yet, nor did we know that he'd be moved out so quickly. While I was actually quite relieved to finally have him packed up and out of the house (something I've been pushing to have happen for over a year now, my husband was more emotional about the whole process. Mostly its been a smooth transition, however, he still feels like he has a room in our home and readily shows up whenever he wants. This happens most frequently at dinnertime, which is frustrating. I hope he'll step up his own personal responsibilities and take care of himself without so heavily still depending on us for his sense of security or wellbeing.",3ATPCQ38J9W8GGP83N7RIP5N7AJYAP,3ATPCQ38J9W8GGP83N7RIP5N7AJYAP
