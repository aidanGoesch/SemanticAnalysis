It takes place during the time in which I live in Hawaii. I was homeless for 9 years in Hawaii because of the president during that time was trying to extort money from military families to fund his campaign about going to war against another country. I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing the Sheriff at our front door saying that we were going to be escorted out of our government house due to the fact that we were unable to make $3000. 00 within the week to give them. At the time I didn't know what this meant because I was so young. After we began to move out of our house, Reality began to make sense and the danger of the unknown future was beginning to weigh down upon the center of my consciousness. I grew up homeless, loosing everything that I ever owned over a weekend changed the way that I think and see things. I grew up in homeless shelters, living in the back of a car with my brother, sister, and mother who was at the time very frustrated with the way things were going, I didn't blame her. My mom never made good decisions afterwards. She picked the wrong people to trust and those people always took advantage of us. Those who were supposed to be apart of the Christian society are the most wicked people I have ever lived with. Taking the little money we had and abusing my mom in front of me makes me want to hunt them down and treat them in a similar way. I will not forgive them, nor forget them. Years have passed now, My mom is dead. She died on the Fourth of July. She endured all of that abuse just to die a few years later. I am alone now. I have no real family left. I am attending Job Corps which I am now hearing are being shut down throughout the country by another man that says he does it for the ""Good of the Country"". I have no bad feelings towards the present president, but I hope that he doesn't make another decision like the past president that will affect so many in the most unfortunate ways. They say America is the greatest country, I don't see that any more. Its the greediest.",,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP8Q3ON
