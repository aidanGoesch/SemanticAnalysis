He was a healthy baby and seemed to be doing fine health wise. He was very active, and after a few months, got onto a regular sleep schedule. We talk to other newborn parents about our experiences, and we are thankful that our experiences aren't as stressful as other parents' experiences. However, last winter, he got sick. my wife and I brought him to a specialist. He informed us that a special procedure had to be done to save his life. How could it be? Our healthy baby boy may be on the verge of death. I was nervous about him dying as a result of going under anesthesia. We prayed and mulled over the decision. After long thought, we felt it was best to have this procedure done to save his life. Thankfully, the anesthesia was fine. We got results about his health, and he is expected to make a full recovery. Thank goodness! I am so thankful for our beautiful baby boy, and am appreciative of the doctors who helped us and him through this ordeal.",,3ATTHHXXWBAYMTIWAFD2G9MXKTWXIO
