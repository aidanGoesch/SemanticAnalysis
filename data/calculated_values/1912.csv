It was during winter, and I was pretty depressed about the season changing.  I tend to really hate winter, and it makes me very depressed and gloomy during the winter months.  So I was pretty stressed out knowing that my baby was going to have to get a surgery.  I was worried about having my baby go under anesthesia and unconscious.  It'd be the first time they were having an operation, and I was so worried about the fact that sometimes things go wrong.  I was praying to god that my baby would wake up and the surgery would go smoothly.  Thankfully everything went well.  The anesthesia was fine, and I was informed that the operation went smoothly and the surgery was a success.  I felt a great relief.  I felt a weight was lifted.  I felt I could stop worrying.  I was so happy.  Hopefully I won't have to go through something like that again.  The doctor informed me that my baby is going to live a healthy life, and this operation will never have to be performed again.",,3ATTHHXXWBAYMTIWAFD2G9MXKTWXIO
