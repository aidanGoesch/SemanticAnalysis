I have an anxiety condition that makes certain things hard for me such as strong emotional feelings and the inability to ""get over"" things. I was quite young when I met my husband but we instantly hit it off. Unfortunately in the beginning of our relationship we ran into some infidelity on my husbands part. Some very terrible things done right in front of me with terrible people only too eager to go along. Things that took years and years to stop haunting me every night but definitely never went away. I cant even think about these things without opening all the wounds back up. We got better and we moved on and we started to really grow together. We had children, he got more raises at his job. Recently we finally were able to move into a bigger and nicer house. I felt calmer and comfortable. Then one day about a month ago maybe not even that long, im sitting at the house cleaning up hanging out with the kids and I get a phone call. I answer it and its my husband and he doesnt know how to say it so he just does. The secretary at his work got fired and his boss hired a woman he had cheated on me with in the past. For most people that may have been uncomfortable but for me and my anxiety disorder it felt like a bomb went off in my head. I felt like all the air had been sucked out of the room and I started to cry and panic. It felt like my worst fear had sought me out to pluck me from the comfortability I had finally gotten used to. Its been hell since then. My husband has been faithful all these years since then and gives me no reason to doubt him but my anxiety doesnt care to hear any of it. He is trying his best and so am i, but i still sit here sick to my stomach thinking of that horrible woman up there in his space. I am trying to be strong and get through for my family.",,3AUQQEL7U6FVB9WL6ANEMKPGJQIV04
