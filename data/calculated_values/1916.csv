He started off from a backround of poverty and had to fight for everything he earned. He worked odd jobs, at all hours of the day in order to build himself and his family a better life. This is that story. He became a construction worker to pay for school. He liked working with his hands, but he knew that it would not be sustainable in the long run for his body and for his health. He still liked the possibilities of design and construction so he became an architecht. His ultimate dream was to build a house for us that he could be proud of. He worked all day and studied all night. He worked on some incredble projects as the city we grew up in experienced an economic boom. He helped build tall skyscrapers and schools and other buildings. But he never lost sight of his dream. Finally, he was able to save enough money to try his hand at his dream. He was able to build a grand house that he could safely keep his family in after so many years. I remember hearing this story and being in awe of the effort and dedication my father had towards providing us a good home. I'll never forget his sacrifices and his hard work and hope that I can do the same. It really was a true inspiration.",,3AUQQEL7U6FVB9WL6ANEMKPGJR80V1
