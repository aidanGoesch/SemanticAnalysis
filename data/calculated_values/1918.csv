What a night. 3 months later and I still can't believe she got married, never thought she'd get over her last boyfriend. Decided to go out downtown, which I don't really know that well but it's what she wanted. Luckily she knows how to get around since I was already tipsy before we left since we pre gamed at my house. That was a mistake. I was drinking more then usual since I didn't really know any of her friends that were out with us and I was kind of nervous. By the time we made it to the third or fourth bar I was hammered. So looking back I think she planted a fingernail in my drink as a joke. I was so drunk I thought the bartender had planted it. Why, who knows. So I made a huge scene about it in the bar. She was trying to stop me and calm me down but I was so disgusted I didn't want too. The bartender got really offended and we got in too it. Told me I'd had enough and to leave. Luckily my sister was able to convince him that we could stay and I didn't ruin her party. Although I doubt she'll invite me out with her friends again any time soon.",,3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28Q27ZIG
