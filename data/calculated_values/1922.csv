I have a bit of a fear of things like that. Imagine  how I felt being asked my Mike if I wanna go with him to Colorado to hike a mountain. I am not adventurous at all either so this sort of thing takes me by surprise. I can't say that I was into the idea, but I went along with it despite being weary of it. Going to Colorado was a quick trip. I expected it to take longer, but me and Mike talked the whole time so time passed really fast for us. We went to a store to rent hiking gear and ended up asking about the mountains to hike there. We decided on Mt. Ouray. I have no idea, but that was the one we went with. The next day, Mike was sick and couldn't go hiking. I had already paid for my things and Mike urged me to not waste the money and just go anyway. So I did. I ended up being scared most of the time. What if something happened to me?! Soon after all the worry, I had reached the peak! 13,960 ft in the sky and I did it on my own. I had never felt more confident in myself in my life!",,3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28R6CIZD
