I decided I want to go on a big hike this year and conquer a 13er. So I chose to hike Mt. Ouray which is almost a 14er, 13,960ft+. It was a long drive up to around 11,000ft and then I got up early in the morning and hiked the rest. It was a very difficult hike. It took me several hours and I was by myself during this so I had to be very careful. Eventually after around 4 hours I made it to the summit. I almost thought that I was going to have to turn back. The view opened up in all directions to incredible vistas and vastness surpassing anything I had seen before. I was all alone on the summit miles away from any other human beings. It was quite special and I was very proud of myself for my accomplishment. The hike down was also quite difficult. It took me longer to descend and my legs were very tired. I brought just enough gear and water for the trip, just light enough to make it easy for me to carry. I planned it well on a perfectly clear day and got back to my camper around 3pm. It was an incredible experience and not one that I'll ever forget.",3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28R6CIZD,3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28R6CIZD
