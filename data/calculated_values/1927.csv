""You can't win!"" But there I stood before a magistrate in divorce court. My soon-to-be-ex-wife attended, too. A year prior, she had abandoned me and our three children for a scumbag drug dealer. So tensions were high! Why did she flush fourteen years of marriage down the toilet and ""abandon"" her children? All I know is she blames me. But none of that ""he said, she said"" mattered. On the day we stood before the magistrate, what mattered was what's best for the kids. Madam magistrate called upon me, and I delivered my exposition with the eloquence of a trained attorney. Then it was my wife's turn. She stuttered, mumbled, painfully delivered her points. After listening intently to both sides, the magistrate informed us she'd render her recommendation at a later date. In the meantime, the naysayers returned with a vengeance. ""Men don't win custody, especially in Florida,"" they asserted. ""As long as the mother is not unfit, a druggy, an alcoholic, or basket case, the courts will always side with her."" Honestly, my wife is a decent woman; she doesn't do drugs or drink excessively; she's mentally stable. She desired to have our kids. But she couldn't remove the kids from our home until the courts rendered a decision. My contention was I didn't want my kids around her thug boyfriend. I felt justified. The dispute landed us in court, and there we were, awaiting a decision. Within a couple days, the magistrate had delivered her recommendation. I received everything I asked for. A few days later, the judge finalized the order. The right man can win custody, even in Florida.",3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28STYIZA,3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28STYIZA
