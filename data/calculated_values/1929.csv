This was a long tern event that had been building and had been getting worse and worse.  We tried get an at home doctor to treat her, feeling that she would be unable to travel to be seen by a doctor.  However, they would not approved such a doctor, without seeing her PCP first.  I called 911, and the ambulance took her to the ER, where they gave her meds, which helped the back.  They also gave her enough meds to get her to the PCP to be seen.  However, the PCP needed to send her for a referral for her MRI test.  At first, Soonercare denied the MRI.  Then, after we put pressure on them they approved.  She had her scan, and the doctor sent her to another place for the back evaluation.  Then, they scheduled another place for the back shot.  After many trips and different places, she was able to get around a little bit.  It was very frustrating and financially difficult for us, as she provides a lot of family income.  It is still not fixed, as she cannot get approved for a survery, even though they see the problem.  Her therapy appointments are used up, too.  So, she is back on just resting on meds.",3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28TV7IZO,
