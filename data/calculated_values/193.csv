I miss him every day. I regret not talking to him the last few months of his life. I should have took into consideration more what was going on with him and been more understanding. It was a big mistake on my part. My Dad was a kind and loving man, and I feel like I let him down. He never got to meet my daughter after she was born. The most memorable event was the last time I saw him, we drove off in the van and he was just sitting in his wheelchair in the driveway, glaring at us. He was happy that we were leaving because he thought we were overreacting about what he had done and said. He started to get REALLY mean to my 2.5 year old son and would say terrible things to him when he wouldn't listen. I'll never forget his facec as we drove off. I think about it all the time. I wish I could tell him that I'm sorry and that I love him. I was so shocked when I got the phone call. We visit his grave in Redmond all the time, but now it's almost winter so we will have to wait a bit. He meant so much to my son, now Malakai says ""Grandpa is in the stars!"". It breaks my heart. We were not expecting him to pass so suddenly, he had a heat failure. I wish I could have been thee with my Mom when it happened, she was all alone.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVUDNJ8,
