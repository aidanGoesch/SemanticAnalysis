My daughter was in the back seat and was very scared. The other driver did not stop and kept going. It was hard for me to pull over safely, but I managed to do so. She was crying the whole time, as I was trying to figure out what was going on and what happened. The whole incident put me into a state of shock. I couldn't understand why the other driver kept going. I felt very helpless, but finally managed to call the police. Very luckily, my daughter was unharmed. I was a bit injured, but not too seriously. I was very glad when my brother finally came to pick her up. I was left to deal with the police at the accident scene, and it was a hassle. The entire time I was in a state of anxiety, shock, and I could feel the adrenaline going through my body. I was so angry at what the other driver did, not stopping. I was able to get a tag number, which has helped in the investigation. I'm still dealing with the trauma and stress from the event, but I was most glad that my daughter was not harmed. The whole situation could have been much worse.",3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXIAC300,
