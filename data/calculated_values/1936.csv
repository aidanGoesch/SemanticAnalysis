I gave them plenty of advanced noticed, but they kept coming up with excuses as to why they couldn't attend. I felt like they didn't want to be part of our family. It all started when I mentioned to my in-laws that I wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday with my kids. The three of us share the same birthday month and because it was a milestone birthday for  me, I thought I could make it a memorable one by making  it a big bash for the three of us. I didn't realize that this decision would cause discomfort to my in-laws. I just knew that I was going to make it a special day and I wasn't go to let their sour mood stop me. I proceeded to plan our joint birthday party despite their lack of support. I order catered food and my kid's friends helped decorate our house for the party. A friend of my also helped with setting up music and entertainment for our guests. Everything for our special day fell in to place. The big day finally arrived and our party went off without a hitch. We celebrated, sang, and ate like celebrities. My parents even flew from Australia to join us. It would have been a perfect day, but one half of our family was missing. I was shocked that my in-laws would be so petty about our joint party. I was also sad for my kids because I know they would have liked them to join us. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed in my in-laws for not making any effort to attend our special day.",,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXK1A03F
