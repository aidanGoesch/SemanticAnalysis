I suppose there is some shame that he feels with regards to what happened in his life and that is why he stopped talking to me. I really don't know. I would like to know what happened though. Did he fall down on his luck? Did he get caught up with people who were bad for him overall? I would really like to know the story behind his imprisonment. I would like to reach out to his family but don't know how to contact them.  I don't know who he talks to anymore as per friends either. I've tried writing as well but get no response. I would like to help if there is something I can do to help. I'll try contact one more time and then leave it be. Perhaps the embarrassment and shame of it all is too much for him. It's rather sad really. He was a super nice guy in high school. He had a lot of potential to do good things in the world. That's why I find it rather strange that he got caught up in something that put him in prison. It's just sad.,,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXR4P037
