My mum had told me my dog wasn't in a good way. She had gotten sick and the vet said there was nothing they could do to help due to her age. It was at that point I decided it was time for me to visit. I had also been feeling extremely homesick. I was super ready to come back. It was so lovely to see everyone and I could tell they were genuinely pleased to see me. There was a lot of catching up to do. My cousin had also recently had a baby so it was lovely ro be able to meet him for the first time. I also saw my old friends who I remain close to. I was also super grateful that I was able to see my dog again before it was her time to pass, I was quite shocked at how skinny and old she had gotten due to her bad health, her appetite just wasn't what it used to be and she looked much older than before. You could tell that she wasn't feeling herself but she still made the effort to come sit with me and seemed very happy that I was with her. I still think of her so often. she was one of those once in a life time dogs that has such a big personality and grows up with you. She was so full of life.  It always really hard to leave everyone again when I come back, I love my life here but I do miss them dearly. I am forever torn between two places. I am planning to go back again soon for another catch up in the new year.",3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXS6S03F,
