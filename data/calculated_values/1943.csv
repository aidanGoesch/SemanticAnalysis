I was super home sick and needed to see my family so I saved up all my money and bought a plane ticket. They were all waiting for me at the airport, super excited to see me. I was super excited to see them too. When we got back to the house my Godmother has made my favorite dinner. I was touched that they all remembered. I felt truly seen and loved. I got to also see my dog again, She wasn't looking very well and was getting old. She had very bad arthritis in all four of her legs and a spinal issue but she still tried to jump around in excitement to see me. I sat with her on the floor and she put her big ole head on my lap. My godfather then mentioned that he felt it would be the last time I saw her as she's been steadily going downhill for the past month. I wish he wasn't but he was right. As soon as I got back here, 2 days after, they called me to tell me she had passed away. I'm forever grateful for getting to see her and still really sad. I hope that wherever she is now she feels better.",3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXS6S03F,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXS6S03F
