One of my favorite memories of that day was being seated alongside several of my friends, where we could see the newlywed couple together. None of us had seen my cousin dress so nicely before. In fact, most of us knew him as a fairly slovenly man, who rarely shaved and often had messy hair. His appearance become a source of merriment for us and we soon began making jokes about the way he looked. One friend adopted a rigid demeanor and did a funny impression of my cousin. Another friend, my cousin's old college roommate, found some old pictures of my cousin on his cell phone and used an app to stitch together some pictures from college with pictures from that day to make a series of ""before and after"" photos. A third friend remembered my cousin telling him that he would never wear a suit in his life and we all laughed at that recollection. When my cousin and his wife made their way to our table, we shared the jokes with the couple. His wife found my friend's impression of my cousin to be especially humorous. My cousin laughed when he saw the before and after pictures, though I think he may have been a little embarrassed, too. Still, despite that embarrassment, he knew everything was in good fun and without malice. When I think back to that day, the joking we shared at that table was is my most vivid memory. I suspect my friends would agree. I think that is why my cousin and his wife sat us all together that day. I think they wanted us to have as much fun as possible.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE3IKPGR
