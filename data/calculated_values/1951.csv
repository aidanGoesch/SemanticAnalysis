My significant other was not always so empathetic and I wasn't sure why. I am guessing that his upbringing had something to do with it. I started to feel like I even might need to go to the ER and my health was at stake. I felt like this particular time he changed for some reason. He heard and saw how I was reacting to being sick. He honestly seemed worried. I am now feeling like he can take care of me in case it ever happens again. He did what he was supposed to do, he cared for me. He brought me to where I needed to be in order to get back to normal again. He took the proper steps. This time he knew it was for real. He didn't hesitate. The time it took for him to help me was swift and I appreciated it immensely. He also was still very thoughtful the next morning. He actually brought me a bouquet of my favorite flowers so I could remember the moment with him and how he was so caring. I think he finally realizes that the relationship he and I are in is serious and to be as kind as he is is rewarding in many ways.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI,
