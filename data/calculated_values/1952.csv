I thought I needed to go to the ER in fact. It was the middle of the night. I didn't want to wake my significant other in case the symptoms passed. It was like I was having a heart attack, almost, however. I got up and went to the restroom where I just basically rested and tried to see if my shortness of breath would pass. It did after I remained calm and steady. I heard my fiance at the door, he woke up despite my trying to be quiet. He actually noticed I was in the bathroom for quite some time so he came looking to see if I was fine. This surprised me because he is usually a heavy sleeper. On this particular night he was not, which was a good thing! I was so surprised as he spoke to me in such a gentle way and not grumpy also. There have been a few times when he was not in a good mood when he did wake up suddenly for other reasons. After he saw I was okay we both went back to bed. We decided that I would make a Dr appointment in case something was still wrong. Then he went to work the next day as normal. When he came home later that evening he brought me a bouquet of roses which were my favorite! I was surprised and shocked. He had never done that before after finding out I wasn't feeling well. I think he was really changing his ways. I just might be able to spend my life with this man afterall.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI
