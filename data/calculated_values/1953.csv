I love DIane so much and we had such a big influence on each others lives while we were figuring out who we were. I also love her fiance, Mark. I think they are perfect and I always have thought that they were. You know, funny story.. I was supposed to go out with Mark but I was not feeling the blind date thing so Diane went instead of me, and they have been dating ever since. Kind of makes me feel like Cupid. It was so nice to see all my old friends that I havent seen in a few years, it is always great to catch up with my old friends and find out what they have been up to. I hadnt seen Candace since high school. well turns out she married the high school quarter back, and then they got divorced because he was seeing a girl on the side. I was very surprised to hear about that considering they were like the dream couple in High School. All in all, it was a beautiful ceremony and I was very glad to have went. It was wonderful to reminisce with my old pals and meet their beautiful families. Diane was the most beautiful bride I have ever seen and it was such a romantic time, me and Mark laugh about how it was kismit that him and Diane met instead of him and me. It was suprising to hear about Candace and her husband. Lastly, it was just such a great time with good old friends. That is my wedding expierence for today.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNETJ0GPQ
