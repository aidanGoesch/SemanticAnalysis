I was actually surprised to hear she was getting married. In school we all thought she would be the last person to settle down and start a family. The wedding  ceremony was beautiful as was her dress. The reception was simple but nice. The best part of the day was being able to catch up with Jen and all my old friends from school. I was surprised Dan made it up from Texas he was as much fun as I remembered from my own wedding years age. Brian brought his daughter who has grown so much since the last time I saw her. I was sad to hear he was divorced, but also not suprised. He seemed happy though. I was great to be able to dance and have fun while hearing about what everyone was doing now. Some how Bob got talked into providing the music just like back in college. But as usual he was right on point and knew just the type of music to keep us dancing until late into the night. Beth caught the bouquet so hopefully this means we will all be getting together again soon for another wedding. I look forward to seeing everyone again soon.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNETJ0GPQ
