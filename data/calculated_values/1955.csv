My roommate was marrying his girlfriend of 4 years. It was nice because I saw many friends from high school and college. We all got to catch up after not seeing each other for many months due to distance, work, etc. We had all enjoyed the food. There was lobster and Asian food. It was at a nice hotel lobby and I got to talk to a lot of old friends. I caught up with many people, drank with old friends, and celebrated the new life of my roommate. A memorable moment was when we were all dancing at the end. I don't normally dance but I didn't care. It didn't seem like anyone noticed how bad I dance either. We all had a good amount to drink and dancing was really fun and lighthearted. It was a great night. They are now expecting a child. It is crazy how fast time goes by.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNETJ0GPQ,
