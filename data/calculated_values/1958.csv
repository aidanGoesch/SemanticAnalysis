I got an offer from a friend's former boss and I was so torn. I wasn't sure what to do but was excited by the new company. I decided to stop overthinking and go with my gut. My gut told me to quit. I was so nervous! not only was i leaving my first job ever but i was also going ot have to quit on people that i cared about. I spent days crafting how i would quit. I wrote it out before i met with people. After quitting, i started a new job. My new job is totally different than what i did before. I also am now working at a significantly smaller company. Not only is everyone at my new job awesome, i'm challenged in a whole new way. Quitting was the best decision of my life. Sometimes you need to do what scares you and what is difficult.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNEU7CGPF,
