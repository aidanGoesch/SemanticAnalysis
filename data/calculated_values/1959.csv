I felt so good about myself. It was very unexpected and i wanted to. It was really great to actually quit and get to know that i am ok. I was unhappy with work for a while so this was awesome. I got a new job which was fantastic and the new client was amazing. I love my new job. I started something i knew nothing about and was completely scared. It was prety great to feel confident. I know now that i can do anything. When i started my new job, i brought a lot of stuff from my old job that was irrelevant. I now work in a place where people are so nice and awesome.
