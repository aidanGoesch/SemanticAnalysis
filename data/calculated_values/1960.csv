When my friend suggested we go, I did not want to, because I am scared of roller coasters. However, I am happy I did. My friend encouraged me to get on the ride. I did, and screamed real loud. After a while, my horror changed into excitement. That also changed into enjoyment. I ended up enjoying the ride so much, I joined to queue to get back on for a second helping. I was so happy. We had nice meals too. And a lot of ice cream and cotton candy. We played games at the arcade. We also rode go carts around the place. It was great. I look forward to going back. I loved it.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNEWEQPGI
