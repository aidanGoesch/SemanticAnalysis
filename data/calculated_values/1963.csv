Two months ago was the last day of any actual work, and pretty simple work at that. Dr. Spiro needed his new officejet printer set up and I did the physical transportation and connection at his office before lunch. I logged in through our portal after hours to make sure it is visible on the network, but I already could see locally that everything seemed OK. I closed out a handful of open tickets and assigned my billable hours and all that jazz, but since everyone knew I was leaving for greener pastures I didn't have any new work assigned. That gave me a chance to start packing up my various gear and documents and software, but it took  another trip to pick up my monitor and tower.  I wonder if Gladys is still working there now, she has to be planning on retiring soon. I was glad nobody made any fuss about the departure, I'm not really the sort to want a farewell celebration. I hope Doug manages to do alright with his physical therapy, I saw him around town the other day from my car but couldn't stop to chat. That job was a good start to my working life, but ultimately both I and the boss knew I wasn't destined to remain there forever and it wasn't exactly headed in the direction I wanted to pursue. I'm ready to actually put my degree to some use now, and it will be refreshing to be rewarded and invested in a career direction I'm passionate about. I know I won't miss that blasted commute; it's hard to believe I drove that far every day considering how little I really wanted to be there. I wouldn't be surprised if the whole company went under in a year or two, but I wish the sinking ship good fortune and maybe it can be sold off/merged while still solvent and retaining valuable customers. It took a leap of faith to leave without guaranteed employment, but I think eventually the decision to stop heading down a dead end road was the right one, even if I don't know ultimately where I want to be heading. I know that I'm ready to fully apply myself to something I am actually passionate about and will reap the dividends my efforts sow. I can only hope that my future coworkers will be as amenable as that gang, I think the camaraderie is what I will miss the most. Godspeed, little IT services company!",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU9502VB6BU
