I have not been back since I graduated what seems like a lifetime ago.  I grew up in this small town where everyone knew everyone and everything it seemed.  I always adored the small town lifestyle, its not for everyone,but for me, it was heaven most of the time.  It was an emotional event from the start, however I knew that going in.  It was for my class reunion and I knew it would bring up a lot of old emotions and feelings.  8,000 miles was no small journey I can assure you.  The most emotional part was meeting up Nicole's family.  I dated her for several years before eventually drifting a part.  I found out a few years ago that she had died in a car accident and I always felt her parents blamed me for not sticking  with her because they knew I was one of the only positive influences she would listen to.  They were very accepting and we ended up taking and sharing stories for hours.  Turns out id was very therapeutic for all of us.  As for the rest of my fellow classmates, we fell into our old routines and after a couple hours it was like we never left.  Outside of a few extra pounds here and maybe a little less hair there, we were back!  Outside of all the emotion of the trip, catching up with old friend and bringing up old memories or Nicole, it was one of the greatest moments of my life;  so far!",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950J5BB60
