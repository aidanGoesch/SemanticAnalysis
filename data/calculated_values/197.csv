It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies (thanks for introducing me to Burt Reynolds and making ""Smokey and the Bandit"" one of my all-time nostalgia faves), amusement parks (NOTE: avoid falling down in a pit of animal poo when at the zoo) and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life. I hope and wish with all my heart that we will not be too late.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO,31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO
