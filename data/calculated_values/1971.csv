I had been working extremely hard towards this goal for the last several years.  This included completing tasks that were not typically assigned to someone in my group, working long hours, and working weekends.  It finally paid off in the form of a promotion to manager.  This promotion allows me to oversee a group of 15 people.  There is also added benefits such as a bonus at the end of the year, and 4 weeks of paid vacation.  When i first found out that i was receiving a promotion, i immediately called my wife to tell her the good news.  She was extremely excited, and we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.  She also threw a surprise congratulations party that included our close friends and family.  We went to a local bar to have drinks and celebrate.  Most of my coworkers were happy for me as well.  I have a good working relationship with almost everyone that is going to work under me.  I think there may be a few who are jealous that they didn't receive the promotion, but i don't foresee any log term issues.  This is my first management level job and i'm excited to prove myself.  I believe i will be successful in this job and am looking forward to a bright future.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950K516BM
