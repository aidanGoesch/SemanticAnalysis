I did not know what it was about, except that someone was getting a prize. We arrived at the meeting room and waited for our supervisor. He came in and said that someone did an excellent job recently and was getting a promotion. I was excited but did not want to show it. He called my name and I was smiling. Everyone clapped and congratulated me. I was in cloud nine. I did not know how to respond, but I thanked my boss and my coworkers. I also said that I tried my best and would continue to do so. In addition, I went to celebrate with my friends and family to a nice restaurant. We had some amazing food, and good drinks. The promotion came with a salary increase, and more responsibility. I wanted to keep a memory of that day, and I guess writing about it is the best next thing. I was so grateful and happy about that moment in my life.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950K516BM,
