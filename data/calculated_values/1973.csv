It was an important event for me because I felt that I had worked hard enough to get it. I also think that my superiors saw that too. My friends and family were happy about me. My coworkers congratulated me as well. I receive a higher salary now, and better benefits such as a shorter day and being able to work from home at certain times. I felt proud of my accomplishment and my hard work paid off. It was an important meeting at work since everyone there was clapping and congratulating me. I was very happy and excited. I loved that day, and I was very anxious to start in my new position. I really appreciated all that I was given. I am happy where I am now.  I have to thank my family. I have to thank my boss for his support. I felt that it was long overdue, but I really enjoyed the celebration. I went to a bar with my friends to celebrate.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950K516BM,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950K516BM
