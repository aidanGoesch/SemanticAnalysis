November 2015It was my first year of college and i had just left from a midterm and i was heading over to my boyfriends house to go grab food together. At the time i drove a small mitsubishi eclipse. As i drove i took a detour and drove through a neighborhood due to traffic issues. So anyway, as i drove down the street, the street got more and more narrow. Vehicles were parked on the curb on both sides facing the wrong direction. Anyway, i was driving down, and out of nowhere i see a child run out in front of my vehicle. Of course, this became the worst experience of my life. It all happened too quick and of course as soon as i saw him i stopped the vehicle, but it was too late and the eight year old child hit the front corner of my car. When i got off he was screaming in pain and of course i called 911 as soon as and so did neighbors that had seen what happened. The ambulance and police were there in no time and got the child to safety. While all this happened they took my licence and information and witness statements. The little boy i happened to hit also had four siblings and the police went to talk to them to warm them to not run out in front of the street like that. And although the accident was not preventable and not my fault, it was still a horrible feeling. I definitely don't recommend.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950S0MB6A
