About 2 months ago, i received a phone call that ther was a newborn whose mother was a teenager and did not want to keep the baby. The adoptive agent, Ms Reynolds, stated that my application met all the requirements. she specifically sought me out given that i am a pediatric ICU nurse. s Reynolds continue to state that the child was born prematurely at 29 weeks. the child's mother was a drug addict and the child may have been exposed to heroin. At first i was worried, since i was not sure if i wanted to have such responsibility. I told her that i would call her back.  I spent the next day thinking about the decision to take the child or not. I then thought about my adoptive sister who was born disabled, whom my mother adopted and gave a better life. I thought about how much i loved my sister and would do anything for her. I called back Ms Reynolds and told her that I would take the newborn once she was out of ICU. Two weeks later i had a little bundle of joy in my arms. From the moment i first laid eyes on her, the water work broke and i couldn't stop crying. the next few days were very hard. Lizzy cried all the time. Eventually things improved. yes, it is still challenging. But i would do it all again.",,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D
