I'm very excited that I'm about to have a child of my own. Angie has already had two children, and they were both cesarean births. Consequently, that's why the doctors have said that it isn't safe for Angie to have a normal vaginal birth, so it's going to be a cesarean birth. The cesarean birth isn't exactly the recommended birth method in most cases; do to the extra complications it creates.              I'm afraid of a lot of things, anything can go wrong. Our daughter could be born lifeless, or maybe Angie could die. There are just so many possibilities; not knowing riddles my body with fear. I know that I can't act too nervous; I have to act like everything is going to be fine. I don't want Angie to worry any more than she is already. Angie is very scared; she doesn't like anything that involves hospitals.             I've been in the hospital since 9:00 this morning, and after three hours of waiting Dr. T______ finally comes into the waiting room to inform us that we will be starting in about an hour. Angie's starting to get more contractions now and they're getting closer together, and stronger. I'm starting to worry that she might deliver before it's time for the procedure. I'm right next to Angie asking her how she's feeling, rubbing her hands, and petting her hair. I want to be as supportive as I can; I want to be the best dad possible from the first second of my daughter's life.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D
