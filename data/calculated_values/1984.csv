That morning, I woke up at 5:30 and went to the gym as usual. When I got home, I ate breakfast and read the newspaper. I realized at 7:00 I was running a little behind schedule. So I hurried upstairs to take a shower and get ready for work. That's when it happened; the event would change the course of my life for the next several months. On my way upstairs, I slipped on the wooden steps. Somehow I tripped and my left foot got caught underneath me.  I crawled up the rest of the steps to take stock of what had happened. I was hoping it was just some kind of sprain but I had no idea. I had a client meeting and it was too late to reschedule for that day. So in considerable pain, I showered, shaved, and got dressed. It was no simple task to put on shoes but my foot was not yet swollen so it wasn't impossible. I was able to walk painfully with a limp. I dealt with the meeting. I went to urgent care where an x-ray was taken. All told, I had 4 broken metatarsals. One was seriously dislocated. I would end up needing two surgeries. And nearly three months later, I still cannot put weight on this foot. So much for summer and all of my grand plans. So much can change in the course of a minute. I was seriously depressed for some time, but I finally came to terms with it.",,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI92K
