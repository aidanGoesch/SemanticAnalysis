We were in a cramped apartment at the time living together. We were doing rather well with our money as both of us got promotions in our jobs. It was time to think about moving into a permanent home as our family was going to grow. We decided to contact a realtor about houses in the area. This was pretty scary for both of us. Historically our parents didn't do so well. We were both the first in line in our families to get a college degree and was able to actually make something of ourselves. It was a really exciting time for both of us as well as our baby. It took about two months to find the right house at the right price. I'm so glad we didn't wait any longer as we found out that my wife was pregnant again! We were so thrilled to have another child join us! The realtor took no time in expediting all the services that needed to happen to purchase our starter home. The look on our parents faces were priceless when they saw the house. It's going to be the family house and the go to place, I can just feel it! We're in the process of making our personal touches now and making it as comfy as possible!",,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYHR692R
