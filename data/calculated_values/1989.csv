After a quick examination, the doctors told me that I wasn't dilated enough. We go downstairs and leave. The cramps were very painful and I spend the next few hours at home, laying on the floor.  Around midnight, I can't take it anymore. The cramps were literally making me crying out loud. I woke my husband and went back to the hospital. They thankfully admitted me. I was put in a very nice room. It was large with a single bed, a couple of armchairs, my on bathroom, a counter top, and an entertainment stand with an older television set on it. I initially wanted to go through labor naturally, but after several hours of excruciating pain with the cramps becoming more and more frequent, I finally relented and got an epidural. The relief was divine. I couldn't feel anything. I was able to nap between the many checkups. The nurses and doctors were very nice and made sure I was comfortable. My labor was very long and my main doctor mentioned having to induce labor. Around 7pm on the 21st of September, my doctor decided that I was dilated enough. He had broken my water some hours prior and was now telling me to push. A few pushes in, he asked me if I wanted to feel his head. It was soft and covered in hair. Some more pushing and out popped my son. I was given the baby and I immediately started crying from joy.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYMD829Z,
