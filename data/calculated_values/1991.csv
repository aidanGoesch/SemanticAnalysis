The time went was it was my 2nd time ever after living in the united states for over 10 years. I really enjoy living in the united states but china is my home. when I was back in america everything was going fine. I visisted almost every memorable place in the americas. I wanted to explore a little bit more so I thought it would be perfect to be in china. I was super excited once I decided to go. without thinking i'd be alone traveling there I knew once in china I had people to see. I didn't go alone however. I was able to go there with my sister. Along with my other family members. It was great for everyone to get a chance to visist. we went to some of the most memorable places when were there. Some places like the Tiananmen square, and the forbidden city. we also got a chance to visit the great wall of china.",,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYN7R92E
