I went with a band for which I was bassist for about 10 years but had stopped playing for a few years and was now reunited for this particular concert. The experience was a bit surreal after having not played with this band for a few years, to suddenly be rehearsing and working as a group again. I had actually sold the bass that I used for the the band.  I had to locate and purchase a similar type of bass, which was an undertaking as they are somewhat rare and expensive.  I finally found one somewhere in Minnesota and had it shipped to Brooklyn. It had been neglected and needed a lot of work to put it back in playable shape.  Then I had to figure out how to travel with it since it is an electric upright bass. I eventually settled on the plan of disassembling it and putting the main body in a flight case, then taking the neck on the plane with me.  This was  an attempt to avoid paying a fortune for a full size case and then paying oversize and overweight charges that would have eaten into the budget for the trip. Anyway the plan worked out more or less. I hadn't anticipated that the TSA would look inside the case and pry little parts off of the bass to see if there was a bomb inside. So even though the case kept the bass from being knocked around, it didn't keep it safe from the TSA people. Anyway we arrived safely and i was able to put the bass back together. The show itself was in a 5000 seat hall, which was another surprise since our band probably draws about 1000 people, so that was kind of amusing. We recorded the next day with the band that split the bill with us and hopefully that recording should be released soon. I was also able to reconnect with an old friend that I hadn't seen since our last trip there about 8 years ago, so that was fun for me.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYOUA291,
