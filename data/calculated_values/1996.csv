I am trying to my best to be my own person. I really just wanted to feel loved and accepted. I think with time, that can certainly be possible. It's hard to do something for myself. My family wanted to go to Six Flags almost a year ago. We had to drive there as the closest one wasn't so close. We just wanted to spend some time as a family. The funniest aspects of the journey was just on the way. We shared stories and just tales of a life gone by. It was sobering in a way. The end destination was awesome but for me it was a chance to spend time with family. It was a reprieve away from my problems. It was one that I don't take lightly. I don't think I'll ever forget it.",,3B4YI393VAIFKQZTLH1TL3BSCW8SSH
