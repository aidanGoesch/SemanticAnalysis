I had been watching my phone like an owl for the past week. I was waiting for a work related call that my team was waiting for to close a important deal. It wasnt the call I expected though. It was for  my sister was in labor with the twins. My sister is only 7 months pregnant. I got the call shortly after arriving at work. Just as fast I was back out the door and on my way to the hospital. When I arrived my sister had just delivered and I just was in awe. Even though they were a bit small they were mighty. They were the most precious things I had ever seen. I held my niece and nephew and couldnt stop crying. Seeing the tears of joy my sister had was the most warming thing. I am a mother myself but this was the first time for my sister. It was a moment that we could bond and share the warmth of motherhood. I will never forget the look on my brother in law's face as he absorbed the feeling of being  father for the first time. His tears moved the room to tears. It was the most surreal and beautiful moment. The moment had so much of an impact because I can remember becoming a mother for the first time. I am a single mother who is currently enrolled in RN school looking to finish next year. I would do a survey like this again in the future.,,3018Q3ZVOJCZJFDMPSFXATCQG04RAI
