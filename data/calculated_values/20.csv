The past week our family has had a sort of a hiccup in life! Our youngest son, who is 6, was at school and had broke his foot. We had to pick him up from school and take him to his doctor. When the doctor saw that he couldn't move his foot, he sent us to the ER to have the foot looked at. Everyone at the ER was very nice. One of the nurses was actually the father of one of my son's friends. It was a small world! We did have to deal with the bad news that he needed to have surgery on his foot. He had smashed the top of his foot and a few of the bones was shattered. We had to explain to the nurses and doctors that the teacher told us that him and a few other boys were playing with desks and one fell on his foot. We got the surgery scheduled and our son was a trooper and didn't really seem phased by it. More than we can say about ourselves because we were scared out of our minds about this! This was our first experience with a surgery of any kind and to have it done on our son made it worse! I cried so much while he was getting his foot worked on! Thankfully, the surgery went well and didn't take as long as we expected. He is now on the road to recovery!",,308Q0PEVB9Z8LX0Y7Z7O060FETEI96
