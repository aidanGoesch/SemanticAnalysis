As much as my in-laws wanted a big wedding I'm so happy Nick and I had a small 50 person wedding on the coast. It's hard to believe it has been 3 months already. I don't believe anything can be perfect, but our wedding was so special and was so us. All of our closest friends and family were there and we decided to have a causal wedding on the beach. We rented 4 huge beach houses that everyone could stay in and has a small, short but sweet ceremony on the water followed by a reception in the background of one of the rentals. We had the food catered and everyone was able to drink and dance the night away. It was special to spend it with the people who knew us the most and were closest to us. It was the best day and I look back on that day with such fond memories. The sun was shining and the weather was warm, but had a great breeze. Nick and I had so many special moments shared together with the ones we loved.  Our mom had the best time celebrating us and they could not stop smiling that day. I remember the dance with my dad and how he told me how special I was and how proud he was of me and that I picked the right man. He want so happy that I was happy. My brother and his wife were there. My niece who is only 2 was there. I can't wait to celebrate a year!",,3BC8WZX3V4IRIWZ3R31J5J10G4VRRT
