We saw the pictures of her when she was just a little baby but we couldn't take her home yet since she was so small.  She was such an adorable little yellow lab puppy.  So anyway, it's been about four weeks since we saw her picture (even though she's eight weeks old today) so we headed out for the ride to get her.  It was about an hour and a half drive to the farm that she was living on.  When we pulled up, there was a huge fenced in area with a bunch of other dogs in it.  They all looked so happy and ran to the edge of the fence to check us out.  We hopped out and were greeted by Samantha and her husband Jim and they welcomed us inside.  We chatted for a few minutes before following them out back to where the little puppies were.  There, in a little pile, was our baby Gemma.  She looked so happy and we picked her up and squeezed her and she wriggled around before hopping back down.  We spoke to Jim and Samantha  a bit longer before scooping our girl up again and getting her into the car.  She was very brave for her first long car ride in her little car seat and when we got home, we let her free and she just seemed so happy, like she had been meant to be with us all along.  Today has been one of the happiest days as of recent.  I love Gemma so much and I think we're all going to be very happy together.",,3BC8WZX3V4IRIWZ3R31J5J10YBORRI
