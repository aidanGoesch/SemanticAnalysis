We got there and set up camp. We put up a blue tent. It was very tall. We soon got the kayak and went kayaking. We had a fun time for a little bit. In the middle of the kayaking, we tipped over. We almost drowned. We were lucky that some people were passing and saved us. We each gave each other a big hug. We decided to leave that place after that ordeal. We went home to lay in our beds. This was a taxing event for all of us. I hope we can all recover from this terrible near tragedy. I will definitely remember it as long as I live.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY1MJLYV
