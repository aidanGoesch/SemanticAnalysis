I was inside an auditorium awaiting a summer fest concert. The auditorium was crowded, and my husband and I decided to grab some drinks because it was so hot. The first artist began their performance, and as my husband was paying for our drinks we heard loud pops, followed by screaming. The entire auditorium was frantically rushing to exits, people were dropping down to the ground, some people were trampled over. My husband yanked my arm, signaling to exit behind one of the vendor only access doors. Thankfully, an employee of the auditorium held the door over waved us over to flee. I never turned back because the screams were deafening and the sounds of gunfire rang in multiple places, so I knew there was more than one gunman. We quickly raced down a back hall and exited through a service door. The rush of fresh air whipped through my hair and I saw police vehicles approaching the building. We were flagged over by a police officer to run to an open field adjacent to the venue, and I balled like a baby. We waited for about 20 minutes in the field waiting for the shooters to be found. And then we were told the we could leave. Around 700 people were inside the auditorium, and only around 300 people were left standing in the field. The shooters were shot down by the police and later were found to be obsessed with mass shootings. That night, I survived a mass shooting, and hope to never encounter another one.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY2GDLYE
