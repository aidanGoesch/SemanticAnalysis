I didn't know what to expect when I got there or how the events would unfold. It was very hot and I felt sweaty. the auditorium was crowded. I felt uncomfortable.

It started about 10 am on a Saturday. It started with awards given out to students. There was a slide show of activities that kids did during the year. There was a luncheon so kids and parents could mingle and talk. In the afternoon they gave out diplomas and afterwards everyone went outside. There was activities with lots of drink stations to keep everyone hydrated. By evening it felt calmer. I was feeling relieved.,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY2GDLYE,
