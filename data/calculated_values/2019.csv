Not moving forward if anything moving backwards. I am a mother of three children ages seven, four, and three. My four year old has been diagnosed with autism. This was heart breaking for me. I had my suspicions, but i honestly didn't want to face it . What would this mean for him? What would this mean for me ? For my family? I started going through the possibilities and the anti-possibilities that would now be my future. My child may possibly never speak in conversations. He may never have friends. He may never move out on his own . My precious boy who is always happy and so very loving will now be looked at as a freak in society.  All because of a diagnosis. Because of a disability in being social. Its enough to make my head spin. With all the new realizations comes some very real emotions. Depression seemed to take roots and flourish within me .  Then a conversation with my husband helped me shed the diagnosis like a skin. He said,""What has changed?  A diagnosis? That's it. He is still your baby boy, still your son. He still loves you  just the same . And I can bet that you love him just the same if not more now. "" That is a conversation I will replay in my mind forever.  My boy did not change and my love for him hasn't either. Being a mom is tough. Being a mom of a child with autism is even tougher.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY33QYLF
