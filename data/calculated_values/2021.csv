She's the most amazing person I have ever met. She makes me happy on the bad days. I met her in a chatroom online. We hit it off by talking about various things. We were able to keep a conversation with each other very well. We grew extremely close since that day. I remember she had to leave because she had snow to shovel. This ended up being a life changing event. I have been talking to her, and we are in a relationship now. I fell in love with her right away because of her intelligence and her heart. Now, I am moving to be close to her. This ended up changing the outlook on my life. I will remember the first day we started talking like the back of my hand. We will be going on our first date soon enough.",3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY46JLY2,
