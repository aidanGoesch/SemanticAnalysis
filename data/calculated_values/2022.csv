She amazed me since the day we met. I met her online on a dating app. She has since been my closest and best friend. I am happy and appreciative that I have met her. We ended up talking about politics. We are on somewhat opposite sides of the political spectrum. She is more of the egalitarian left, and I am a libertarian. We have gotten to know each other over the last six months, and we have been extremely close. She is perfect for me because of who she is. I remember that she was shoveling snow as we were talking at first. We ended up being young and dumb at first, and we pretty much got together right away. We both knew that we were right for each other. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I am currently working on moving to her, so we can build a successful relationship. I am looking forward to enjoying a future with her.",3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY46JLY2,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY46JLY2
