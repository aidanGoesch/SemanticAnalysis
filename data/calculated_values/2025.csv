I loved that stupid animal. He would run and play and cuddle with me. I would feel like everything would be alright everytime I held him. Unfortunately, he passed away, and it destroyed me. To make matters worse, at the time, I did not have the money to dispose of his remains the way I wanted to. I could not afford a creamation, and that was sad and tragic for me. So, I turned to the Internet. Thankfully, I found the website GoFundMe. That allowed me to solicit donations toassist in my plight. It was uncertain how it would happen, but luckily enough people on the internet found my story. Because of those kind hearted people, I was able to have my dog cremated. His ashes sit on my mantle with a small thank you to GFM. I'll never forget how the internet came to gether and paid for this. It was a glorious day indeed.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYDZJYLA
