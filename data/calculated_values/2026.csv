He was an elderly dog and already had a lot of aches and pains. I knew this time was coming and it was just a matter of time. I had him since he was a little puppy. Since he was young he had always gotten sick easily. He had stomach troubles and vets would just give general antibiotics. I think it was mainly because he had Giardia and it probably messed up his stomach but who knows. When it happened, I knew I wanted to cremate him. To someone with a low income, cremation can be very expensive. I ended up stating a GoFundMe and ended up raising enough to cremate my dog. I was hesitant but decided to go with it. I was very thankful to all those that donated since I was not prepared financially or emotionally. I still miss him a lot. He was part of my life for so many years. I hope he is resting happily wherever he is.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYDZJYLA
