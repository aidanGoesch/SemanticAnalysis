It was pretty hot so I wore shorts and a tank top. When we arrived I was anxious to see the animals. I walked around and saw the apes first. They were in the shade. I was the lions afterwards and they were also lying in the shade. It was very hot outside! I saw the salt water croc next and he was bathing in the water. He was HUGE! I came across a flyer for a safari and to feed giraffes. I signed right up! We went in a jeep and had some lettuce on hand. The giraffes came right over and we started feeding them. It was great they were gigantic. They were also very friendly!,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYTVHLY3,
