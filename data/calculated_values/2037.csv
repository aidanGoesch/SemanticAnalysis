I really liked my job. I was a coordinator of recreation at small local community college. I was under the impression that I was doing everything I was responsible for correctly. But leading up to my termination, my boss began writing me up for every little thing. The, when the time came, she said it was out of her hands and that HR had decided I was finished. Then, I find out a couple of weeks later that my old boss hired one of her really good friends to take my place. The whole thing has made me incredibly angry. I know for a fact the things she wrote me up for were not worth the punishment. Things that, in the past, she has laughed about with me. It was a set up so that she could get her friend in their. I felt seriously stepped on. Now when I think about it though, I realize that I would not want to work for a person who would do this to her employees. Why would I want to stay if that is a reflection of how she really feels about me. I wrote a letter to HR, justifying my thoughts and actions. But I dont think it has done any good. This was a really significant thing for me considering it was my first ""real job"" out of college. I think that is why it has hurt so much. But I am trying to be positive and see my worth and value.",3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG14QM4G,3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG14QM4G
