I was just going to stay at home and relax on that day. Luckily I had a change of mind and basically force myself to go to the mall and buy an item of clothing that I really wanted. I actually was in the mall for couple minutes looking for a nice leather shoe to buy. I had formal event to attend in a couple days so I really wanted that shoe. As I went from one store to the next. I saw my high school friend a couple steps in front of my. I honestly did realize at first but I was thinking this person seems familiar. i realize that I recognize the person. I kept thinking where do I know that person from. I then realize that the person was a friend from high school. I smile and my friend smile back. Thinking about it now, I am guessing that my friend went through a similar thought process that I went through. We greeted each other with a smile and a hug. We talked and laugh. We talk about our time back in high and what going on in our current life. We then exchange numbers and went our separate ways.",3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7KTM4L,
