It was a ordinary day and I was focus on getting a few items of clothing. I was working and out of now where, both our eyes connected and we where both shock and surprise. I just could not believe it, one of my closest friends friends from high school was right in front of me. She. was not able to finish high school with us because her parents had to relocate to another state and I was even more upset some time after that because we lost contact with each other. It was a very emotional reunion. We talk and laugh and even cried. We kept each other's contact and have remain in touch ever since even meeting up and the weekends. We talked about our past, specifically our time spent in hight school. We even talk about all the big moments in each of our lives that we were not able to share with each other. I got to find out about some cool stuff about her with one being that she had a daughter. She also got to find out some cool stuff about my that I eventually got to visit a few places that I wanted to visit. I also gave her connect to other friends who have not seen or talk to her in a long time. We meet up as a group and laugh and talk about our past adventures. It was a very emotional moment. I feel some happy because of that one moment in the mall.",3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7KTM4L,3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7KTM4L
