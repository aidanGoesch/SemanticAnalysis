From my young age I always dreamed of to become an athlete especially in field games like 100 meter dash and Long jump. I tried most of my young period to get train and to choose my best coach for motivating me and showing me or guiding me towards my goal. I worked hard to get to know the information in this field and also the need of hard work. Then with the help of my parents and personal friend, I found a person who helps me or guides me to reach my passion. He helped me in lot ways and directed me in many ways to one sharp goal of my life. I just followed his words and I believed on his words. In the field of sports, Trusting the coach is the most fundamental thing. By doing so, I was able to reach my goal so easily. I achieved many things in my passion. I won the championship awards for both 100 meter and Long jump events. I was so happy and meaningful that time. My parents were happy and felt so proud. Now, I am doing my free time guiding other young aspiring children who wanted to be athletes. Am feeling so happy and satisfied at the time of being with those children.",,3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWGI39M4E
