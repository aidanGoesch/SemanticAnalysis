I've had her roughly for 14 years and one day she had gotten very sick. Over the course of a week her health deteriorated and the vet was unable to do anything for her. She was the first dog I ever owned. I fed her the snacks and treats she loved to eat until she was unable to eat anymore. Eventually she could barely walk as well. Finally I realized I had no choice but to take her to the vet one last time. So i picked her up, wrapped her in a blanket and carried her into my SUV. Normally she loved to stick her head out the window and watch everything and everyone as she rode in the vehicle but not that day. She could barely keep her head up. Once we got to the vet I checked her in and chose the box they would put her cremated ashes into. Then I carried her inside and placed her on the vets table once we were called in. I stood there holding her until the vet came in to see us. I turned into a mess standing there knowing what was coming next. After it was done the most memorable thing about the whole ordeal was how quiet it was as I stood there alone in that room after the vet left. I stood there for 10 minutes until I could put myself together and finally left the vet's office.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY78S2H0Q
