I thought she was the one when I first laid my eyes on her. After being in a relationship for years, I decided to propose and make her my wife. I thought it was going to be a happily ever after story; married young, have wonderful kids, house with a picket fence, be together until we're old as dirt. Everything was going right in my life. I felt like I was on top of the world. However, as time started to past, we started drifting apart and we started to truly dislike each other. Couldn't believe it, but we were no longer in love with each other. She claimed I wasn't home enough for her and the kids, I wasn't making enough money, and my ""sex game"" was poor. On top of that, I found flirty text messages of her communicating with some guy I never met.  We ended up getting a divorce, but the divorce ended up being the worst thing I ever went through. Since I filed for the divorce, she made sure to make my world a living hell. I was at work, struggling to pay attention due to my stock positions being incredibly down in a long time, and this guy comes to my desk with a smile on his face. He served me papers, from my ex, that stated that she wanted full custody of the kids. I couldn't believe this woman. Since then, I started to fall into a depression. I haven't seen my kids in days, my job's numbers are poor, I needed a lawyer for the lawsuit, but I couldn't afford one at the time. My job just wasn't cutting it, due to the extraordinary bills I had. I needed to find another job as soon as possible, but time wasn't trying to be on my side. Nobody was giving me a chance, I was too overqualified. Suddenly, I was given an opportunity that came out of nowhere; one of my bosses quit. I was next in line for that position, which means instant promotion, instant bonus and instant opportunities. I was finally able to deal with this lawsuit. In the end, I won the lawsuit; we share custody, and she pays for my lawyer fees as well as hers. I never wanted it to be this way, but this lawsuit showed me that life is real and anything can knock you off your tracks easily.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7BCS0H6
