I wasn't expecting anybody. It was a non-threatening guy with a clipboard holding a fat stack of papers. He asked for my name. Handed me the papers and had me sign off that I received the papers. Glanced at the stack, it's a lawsuit. My ex is taking me to court again. Get inside and look thru the lawsuit. She is fighting again for custody of the kids! A bunch of other stuff mainly about money but I cannot believe she is trying to take the kids away again. I had just left my job of 11 years to start daytrading full time. I took some big hits with the market being crazy and money is really tight. My lawyer said he wants $3500 up front to represent me. Something I definitely can't afford right now. I started looking for another job to get money for this lawsuit. I am so stressed and it is very difficult to not say anything about the lawsuit to the kids.",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7BCS0H6,
