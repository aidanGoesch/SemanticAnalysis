I wasn't expecting anybody so I thought about not answering the door. Maintenance was supposed to paint over a patch they had fixed last week so I thought it might be them. I opened the door to a plain-clothed guy holding a big stack of papers. He asked for my name then handed me the stack, It was a lawsuit filed by my ex. Another lawsuit. I was being served. My ex has done this before. In two days I was leaving with the kids and some other family to go out of state. Read thru the 12 pages of ridiculous accusations and requests. The worst was the one where she wants custody of the kids. Right now we split the time evenly. 42 points in the lawsuit over 12 pages. Timing could not be worse. Stock market has been so volatile and I had lost about everything in the previous two weeks. I had a few hundred dollars from the last lawsuit on retainer with my lawyer. I called him for advice. He told me the way my ex worded the lawsuit there is no way to get it dismissed or thrown out. This will have to go all the way including disclosures and mediation and possibly in front of a judge. The lawyer wants $3500 up front to help with the case. I'm broke! I have nine open positions that I didn't close because the stock price bombed. I keep waiting for them to come back. I will have to get another job.",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7BCS0H6,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7BCS0H6
