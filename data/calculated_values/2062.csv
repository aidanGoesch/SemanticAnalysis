That was, until I met Jessica about 2 years ago at a rock climbing gym. We really hit it off right away and it was like love at first sight. My life really changed for the better as I got to know her more and we became like partners in an adventure. A few months ago we decided to finally get married. We were trying to figure out what type of ceremony would be appropriate for the two of us. After some brief discussion, we realized that it wouldn't make sense to have a fancy ceremony since we were pretty simple people. Instead, we decided on a small, lighthearted ceremony that tried to emphasize the fun that we've had in our relationship. The actual wedding day was two weeks ago, and it was such a blast. We hired a few joke writers who made speeches that poked fun at various guests attending the ceremony, as well as myself and Jessica. It went better than expected, and their routines were really classy, but still amazingly funny at the time. We also made fools of ourselves by trying to dance even though we're both pretty clumsy. It was OK though, because it got a lot of laughs out of the attendees, which is the most important part. I will always cherish the memories that I have of that day. That day really symbolizes what kind of people Jessica and I are, and what type of relationship we hope to keep until death due us part.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7K670HI
