I went with my mom, who had just finished up a year of chemo. She'd visited just the previous year, before getting sick. It was very strange for me seeing relatives after such a long time. Some I had never met, they were kids. It was very stressful dealing with my mom and my grandma at once. They're difficult personalities. I liked getting back in touch with cousins for the most part. One seemed to be avoiding us for some reason and I don't think it was ever sorted out. I'd been caring for my mom alone for the previous year and it took everything out of me. As a result the visit was paid for by relatives which I appreciated. But I really didn't think it made up for them leaving me hanging all that time. They've always been very well off and work in the medical field to boot. I haven't really had any contact with them since. 6 months later I'm still caring for my mom alone.",3BGYGHDBBY6TAS1XXN7H33LKART220,
