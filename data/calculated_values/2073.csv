They add a lot to your life and I've been lucky enough to have some special ones. Recently, we had two older dogs and knew that eventually, it would come time to say goodbye to them. Indy, who we rescued when she was just a few months old, was turning 13 this year. She'd suffered from a tumor that was growing larger every year. She was still a happy dog and wiggled her little stubby tail a million miles an hour whenever you'd notice her. A few months ago, she got sick and despite our best efforts, she passed away. We were able to keep her at home, she suffered from anxiety and hated to be separated from her family. We were all able to say our goodbyes and spend time with her before she passed. We buried her in our backyard, made a nice place for her to rest in peace. She brought so much love and joy into our lives and was a special dog. She was stubborn and had a weakness for chicken and just made you smile when her whole body wiggled with joy. Saying goodbye is never easy. Watching her give a last few wiggles of her tail despite being so weak but letting you know she still heard you talking to her was both heartwarming and heartbreaking. I was there as she breathed her last. I sat with her for a while hating to say goodbye and not really ever ready to let her go, but knowing that it was time. My heart still hurts when I think about her, but I also smile remembering all the wonderful memories I have of times spent with her. We've added a new member to our family so that Indy's passing doesn't leave such a hole in our lives, but she'll never be replaced or forgotten.",,3BQU611VFQ6FAW7V351BND1C4WG99Y
