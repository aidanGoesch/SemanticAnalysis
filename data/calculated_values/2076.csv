This isnt a fact that I readily hide from people. Last week i was at my friend kyles house and just having a good time. Kyles other friends from school were there and I met a few of them. Apparently drunk me was so friendly and charming that one of Kyles friends took note of it. The next day I got a text from his friend charlie asking if i would help him market his alcohol brand. He had it geared towards rager parties and college aged people. I accepted and he even gave me a signing bonus. My role is to go to these host parties and just be me while having a good time. I was so surprised that my drinking and partying could lead to a career. The first event is this friday night and I am stoked. I get to be paid to drink booze and meet girls. I dont think there could be any better line of work. I know this isnt a long term thing, but it beats delivering pizza like I was doing. I am living the dream right now and never want to wake up.",,3BQU611VFQ6FAW7V351BND1CU0Q996
