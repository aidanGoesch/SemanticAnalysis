I wasn't expecting it at all. I had been talking with a friend of a friend about her small business. She has an employee turn in her notice. She wanted to talk to me to see if I might be interested in the position. After we met, I asked her what she wanted the next steps to be. She got very vague, and talked about how they needed to let the other girl leave, and really take a look at their work load and see figure out what they needed in this new person. I thought that would be the end of it, I thought she didn't know what she wanted to do, and didn't know if I was a part of that at all. Then she circled back with me in about a week, and said we should talk more about her company. I went over to her house after work one day, and we sat on the front porch and chatted. She explained they needed someone who could start out doing operations and learning the business, then in 6 months they could add in marketing and a bump in title and pay. Eventually, she wants this person to be the COO so she can retire. Then she said she could bring me in at my current salary, and would I be interested? I've never gotten a job this way- I've always gone though a formal interview process and had a job description and everything! But I accepted it- I think it's a great opportunity!",,3BQU611VFQ6FAW7V351BND1CU0Q996
