I had stopped at the gas station to buy us something to drink as well as snacks, and had just pulled out of the gas station. We got about five minutes down the road when we hit back to back traffic. I was looking down at my phone trying to change the song, and had not been paying attention to the fact that the car in front of me had stopped because of the traffic. I rear ended them and tried to  quickly put my foot on the breaks, but due to the impact I ended up hitting them a second time. The impact also caused them to hit the car in front of them. We pulled over to the side of the road, where I saw that although the front end of my car was completely messed up and pushed in, both of the other cars were fine, and only had a few noticeable scratches, if that. My car was not safe to drive due to fluids leaking out of the engine, and the tow truck that took my car said my car was basically totaled, and it would most likely be too costly if I were to try to get the car fixed, since I would already have to pay a bit of money for them towing the car and taking it to the auto shop that towed it. I ended up just paying them and letting them keep the car at their junkyard. Due to my car being totaled I have been out of a car for the past few months, and although I am now working from home at the moment, I was unable to do the job I had originally been working doing, as I used my car travelling to different stores doing audits. I am still without a car at the moment due to the accident. The job I am working now has just started so I do hope I am able to buy a new car at the end of the month. Due to this accident I have had issues with getting basic things done like grocery shopping and running errands. I have been either dependent on family members or on Lyft or Uber to get around, which is a bit of an inconvenience at times. I cannot just go where I want exactly when I need to, and it also costs quite a bit of money getting around if I use Lyft or Uber, which has become very expensive.",3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAH3A6E,
