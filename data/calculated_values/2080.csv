There was heavy traffic, and I had looked down to change the song playing on my phone when I rear ended the car in front of me due to not noticing they had stopped. Unfortunately this caused my car's front in to be pushed in, totaling my car due to the damage. My car was the only one left damaged, the other person's car only ended up with minor damage and scratches that were barely noticeable. Thankfully, nobody was injured but it has been hard for me to work since then because my job required me using my car to travel and I no longer have a car at the moment. Being a single mother with no help taking care of my daughter, I was devastated because the jobs I used my car to do were one of the few jobs I was able to do that I could work around my daughter's school schedule so that I could be home when she got out of school, since I had nobody to watch her for me. I also made just enough to pay bills with a little extras spending money, and I could not afford to pay for childcare for her to work more hours. I now have to work from home to save up to buy another car, which is significantly less than what I was earning before. I know I am at fault and I beat myself every day about not paying attention. I feel like I must work double just to be able to make what I was making before so I can buy another car and it still is not enough, what with having to also come up with money to take a taxi when I need to go to the store or run errands. I feel like in doing that it takes away from what I could be saving for another car or to pay bills. While I hate that this happened I do think it's a life lesson. I realize that I need to be mindful and pay more attention. I also believe it's just another obstacle to make me work harder. I feel discouraged a bit but I do feel like I have gotten creative with learning how to survive.",3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAH3A6E,3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAH3A6E
