Cut my finger deep enough to cut the tendon. Blood everywhere. I couldn't hardly think straight. I just knew I needed to get to the hospital fast. Thank you, God, for neighbors and that Tori is grown! Rushing in the kitchen to get the week's meals done so I could then rush outside to help Tori with the yardwork. Four hours in the emergency room! I am so grateful to all my neighbors. Joe and Kathy got me there. Betty brought us home and Tanya made sure we had what we needed! Thank GOD for good neighbors!! My finger parts aren't quite working right yet and they check in to see if we need anything. This injury is healing slowly. I am grateful because Tori was kind of messed up seeing all that blood. I think it is good for her that they are checking in so she knows we have backup.",,3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUKE56AG
