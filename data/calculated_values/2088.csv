We couldn't agree on anything. We decided to cancel. I decided to have a fun day by myself. I first went bowling. I almost got a 300 but I tripped on the last round. I only got a bruise but had a fun time. I then went to the movies. I saw a blockbuster. It was surprisingly not a remake. It had a great plot with great action scenes. I finished the day at a fancy restaurant. The food was great. I had a nice burger. I had some queso for an appetizer. I had a big beer that was yummy to drink. The whole day was very fun. I hope to do this again.",,3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHOQA7EU
