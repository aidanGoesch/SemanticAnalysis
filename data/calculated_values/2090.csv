My oldest brother was setting things up. We were supposed to go to a restaurant and go skeet shooting. A few days before the date we were going over details, he said the restaurant was downtown and far away and really expensive. Most of us did not want to travel that far and felt it was far too expensive. We all went back and forth and my oldest brother was really admit that we go to this restaurant and would not budge. My wife and I do not have that great of a babysitter for our three young children, so we did not want to travel that far. Also our babysitter was not able to get to our home until later in the afternoon. So we said that we would meet at the activity. My sister then intervened and  said we should just all eat near the activity and be together. My oldest brother started getting very short and rude in his texts. He was being very rude and selfish. Then he drops the bomb that the skeet shooting appointment that he was supposed to make was full and we had to find another activity as well. We continued to go back an forth for another day coming up with different ideas and suggestions. We were almost in agreement when my sister says that her and her husband cannot go, because their youngest daughter whom had surgery the week before still wasn't feeling that well and they did not want to leave her home with her siblings. I was relieved and frustrated at the same time, all that aggravation for nothing. All that back and forth and we had to reschedule.",3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHOQA7EU,3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHOQA7EU
