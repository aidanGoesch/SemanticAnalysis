I had never been on a cruise before so from the time I got to the port I was in complete amazement. Once we were on the ship and did the safety class my family and I went to explore all that we could do on the ship. A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars. Everyone looked at each other in disappointment but agreed that we'd definitely do it all again. I had a lot of fun with my family and was grateful that my cousin decided to celebrate her birthday by going on a cruise.",,3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHPKSE78
