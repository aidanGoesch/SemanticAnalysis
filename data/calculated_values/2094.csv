The theme was lego. It was really more than just a birthday party. It was the first big family gathering at our home since moving into our home. We should have moved in much sooner but Hurricane Florence happened, and we ended up with almost 4 feet of water in our home. I think the most memorable thing was just being in the home, and having our family there, since it was such a horrific experience prior to getting in our home. I still struggle with what happened. The leaves have fallen, and you can see the water lines again on the trees outside. I do remember another thing that stood out was that our dog got in to the cupcakes. There were chocolate and vanilla cup cakes. They came from a local bakery. I had them sitting on a lego thing. Thankfully he only messed up a few. He is a German Short Haired Pointer. My son got way to many gifts. He got legos, cars, kinetic sand, nerf guns and clothes. We had nuggets from chic-fil-a, chips and fruit. We had out family and a few of our best friends there. The kids played and had a good time. I had planned on doing a pinata but never finished it in time. We moved in just days before the party. The driveway wasn't even poured when we had the party. My son did have a great time.",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA535MU7,
