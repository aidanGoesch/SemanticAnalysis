We had all our belongings packed up the night before. We were really excited for it. We went to bed early. We woke up in the morning, for the first day of our cruise. We headed to the port. At the port, we presented our tickets and boarded the ship. It was so beautiful. We settled into our cabins. We all met up on deck and explored the different areas. We had some food at the canteen. We had a drink at the bar. We also lounged on the deck, by the pool. In the evening, we went to a live performance. It was a great day to be on a great ship.",,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA537MU9
