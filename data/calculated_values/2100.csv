This is nothing new, as sometimes I need to explain a chart to a nurse. As I walked away from the sterilization room, I tried to think what they may need help with. I was greeted by a lady who was holding a plant. She said her name is Judy. Judy said that I had saved her life several months ago. I performed CPR on her and saved her life. She was grateful for all I had done for her. She said that since then, she has gone on to do amazing things. She has started working helping others. She gave me a big hug and handed the plant to me. She said it represents her life which I had saved. We talked briefly and agreed to keep in contact. We exchanged phone numbers. It felt really good to be appreciated.",,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA7K7MU9
