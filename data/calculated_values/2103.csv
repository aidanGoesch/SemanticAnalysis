If you didn't know my family, you'd think I was hosting a small convention. A grand total of 48 family members showed up for our reunion! Needless to say, I was shocked at the sheer number of bodies that marched into my home and announced that they are biologically connected to my Davis family. I now know that I have 10 male and 15 girl cousins.  Attached them are another 10 of my new nephews and nieces. All I kept thinking about was how thankful I was to have so many cousins around my age, but how costly gift giving was going to be during the holidays and birthdays. That said, I say the pain of gift giving doesn't outweigh the love and support a large base of cousins, nephews and nieces has to offer. I felt like I had all the love and support that day. Everyone had so many stories to share. My parents, uncles and aunts shared the most embarrassing and blackmail-worthy stories of our childhoods.  After they shared information about my first crush in high school, I just wanted to melt or explode. My cousin had to leave the room after my uncle showed us his old dance moves. After the oldies were done with us older kids, they turned on themselves and shared some hilarious photos with us.  It was an equally painful and loving experience for all.",,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA8MIMUP
