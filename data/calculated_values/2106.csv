The guy lost his cool immediately. I was willing to help but he decided to come at the last minute. I alsready had other obligations that I had to tend to those are just as important if not more important. He just had to understand that. However, he was not taking that answer. Not one bit.  i tried to explain to him that i could see him first thing tomorrow. Not hearing it of course. I called a friend and he was out of town. i tried to go above and beyond. It just was not his timing I guess. I think he should plan better for these thing. It wont be a problem next time. I am pretty sure of it.",,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUAXNKUMQ
