He is my wife's son from a previous relationship.  We got along very well while he was here.  During his visit, he confided in us that his home life has been really unhappy.  He is living with his father, who works long hours and really isn't around for support.  He loves his Dad, but they can't spend enough time together to foster and maintain a good relationship.  My stepson is at an age where he could really use sensible guidance and a reliable support system.  Left on his own, he might not make good choices, and I'd hate to see him head down a destructive path.  I also don't want him to develop resentment against his father for not being there for him.  His father does the best he can, but is single and can only do so much.  To my surprise, my stepson asked us if it would be alright if he came to live with us.  He said he would try to find a job to help us out with expenses, and he would finish school here.  We do have a bedroom, where he stays when he comes to visit. After discussing it with my wife, we decided to allow him to stay with us, as long as his father had no objections.  We think that his dad will let him do it.  He knows that we have the resources and that one of us will always be around for support.",,3C2NJ6JBKB3PZEQQJ651VROIUL3N22
