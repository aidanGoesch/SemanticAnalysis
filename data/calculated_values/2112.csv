He asked to stay with us instead of returning back east to live with relatives. We let him stay and try to find work. We agreed he must finish school. I actually was not thrilled about the arrangement but wanted my husband to have a chance to be with his son. Things have actually gone well. My stepson has two jobs and is finishing high school online. I have been surprised that we have been getting along well. Also he now has a dog that we found and she loves him. We were able to turn our home office into a bedroom. His having a room has work out nicely. We hope that all continues to go well. Our goal is that he can work himself into independence. He should be able to move out and be on his own within a year or so. This is important because adult children should be on their own.,3C2NJ6JBKB3PZEQQJ651VROIUL3N22,
