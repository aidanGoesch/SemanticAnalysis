I was so nervous I couldn't eat more than a banana before heading to the start line.  I had all my materials packed in a backpack but I wasn't sure if it would be enough.  I worried I wasn't prepared and didn't have the support I would need to finish the race.  I didn't know if my swim training would get me across the river.  I wasn't sure if the weather would hold up or if I was even wearing the right clothes.  Was I going to freeze out there?  Did I have enough batteries?  What about food?  Everything I planned for the last months was slowly going away.  When the race started I followed the pack in front of me.  I thought if I could just keep up with those people then maybe they could carry me to the end or help me out if something went wrong.  I couldn't keep the pace so I had to back off.  I was out there in silence but I felt like I was doing so good!  I was making all the paces I had planned and was meeting each check point.  My maps were all right and I didn't feel like I was running out of food or water.  Things were going as planned.  My swim went well and I was ready to go to the climb.  I was tired but still feeling strong.  I took my time in the sections that I was unfamiliar with.  The terrain seemed a little shaky but it was stable.  Then I heard something shift and it was almost as if time stood still.  The next thing I knew I was laying on the ground and couldn't move.  I knew at that point the race was done.,3C2NJ6JBKB3PZEQQJ651VROIUN8N2B,
