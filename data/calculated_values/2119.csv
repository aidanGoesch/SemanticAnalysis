I also like to go out and have fun at bars from time to time. I ended up going out to a horror movie trivia night one night with friends. I thought it would be fun. We were doing pretty well. There was another group there. It was a group females. They were close to winning. I ended up getting the final question right and my team beat their team. We ended up hanging out after. One of the women in the group and I got along very well. We started dating. We fell in love not very much long after that. We just got married a few months ago. We are starting our life together now and it is so great. I love her with all my heart.,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO2JDP6,
