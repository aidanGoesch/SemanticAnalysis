We were all out together at a bar. It was a our normal place that we liked to go to. We ended up playing a trivia game that night. It was horror movie trivia which I am amazing at since I'm such a big fan of horror movies. We played against another team. It was me and my male friends versus a team of girls. The girls ended up winning and after the game I decided to talk with them about it. We all have fun together that night, the two groups of people that were playing trivia. When it was over for the night I exchanged numbers with the woman who would later be my wife. We ended up dating for a period after that. We dated for about 3 months. Then we got married. It was the greatest thing that ever happened to me. I think back to this night often.",3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO2JDP6,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO2JDP6
