He taught me many useful things while I was younger that helped me get through life. I don't know where I would be in life without him. He's the best thing that ever happened to me. But last week he passed away, and I cried a lot when I found out. I miss him and I will always miss him, and I will always remember the things he said and the things that he taught me. We had a funeral, and when it was my turn to speak I cried on stage. I wasn't embarrassed either. I talked about him, and the life we had together. It was a teary moment, and I will never forget it. I love him, and I am sad without him. I miss him so much. Why can't he come back to me. Why did this happen? I don't know.",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO8EDPD
