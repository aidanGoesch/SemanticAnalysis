He had a heart attack.  My story is going to be about him and the impact he had on my life.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school there.  I moved to California, worked, and met my girlfriend at Stanford.  She had family in Georgia and we eventually moved out here to work and live close to them.  Her family is amazing!  Her father, Craig, has traveled the world as a missionary.  He did a few stints in Indonesia teaching poor people how to setup their village, collect clean water, and rear their children.  I loved this man from the moment I met him.  Selfless and very giving Craig would help everyone.  In fact, during my move to Georgia one of the tires on my car blew out.  I tried to put the spare on but the lug nuts were not coming off.  I was in the middle of nowhere, on the highway, with all of my worldly possessions, pets, and girl and completely stuck.  Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.  I learned so much for the other men helping.  After Craig passed the entire community rallied together.  It was sad of course but amazing.  I am thankful I got to know such a great man and role model.",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO8EDPD
