I had already been going through a difficult time in my life. It felt like my life was crashing along with the car that day. But, I ended up finding comfort in an unlikely place: Francine. Francine is the person I wrecked with. Luckily, the accident was very minor. The cars were in pretty bad shape. But we were all unscathed. Francine and I started to talk and in the five months since, have actually gotten very close. Who would have thought that a traffice accident would have been the best thing to happen to me. But here we are, five months later and life is actually looking up. Before, I was looking down an endless hole of my life spiraling into depression. But Francine has shown me the light and we are now very close. She and I talk every day and have even gone on a few dates. My daughter even likes here too.",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHQPGPDR
