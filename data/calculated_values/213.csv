His name was Mr. Bolton. Although he looked quite young, he claims he has been teaching math for 15 years. I have always been very good at math, so I was looking forward to learning a lot in this class. Of course the first few weeks easy because most of the material was review. However, Mr. Bolton insisted that everything been done exactly as he wanted it. For example, we had to right our name in the upper right hand corner of each assignment. If it was not written there he would take of points. In about the middle of October, when we started getting into the new material, things took a turn for the worse. Mr. Bolton insisted that the students were required to show the work for how we solved the problems. He would not except the fact that this is old fashioned way of doing things. Students today are have lived their entire lives in the digital age. When there is something to know, we use our cells phones to search for the answer. That's how we did the work, it can't be written down. If the answer is correct, that all you need. Well, Mr. Bolton kept taking off points for not showing the work, and by Thanksgiving, my average in the class was 47! Since I have always been an honor student, I know the problem was Mr. Bolton, not me. So I told Mom about it. She called the Principal, and got me transferred to another class.",,31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSN20V715
