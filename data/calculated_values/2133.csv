He turned 18 this past April.  In addition, he learned on that day the news we have been waiting all year to hear.  He was notified of admission to his 1st choice college.  We both agreed that this was the best birthday gift he could have received.  We had planned to go out for dinner to celebrate his birthday.  Now we had two very grand reasons to celebrate.  My sister also came to dinner with us so it made it all the more memorable.  I was very nostalgic on this occasion to see my youngest son reach legal age.  Also, he would be departing for college in just a few months.  It was a very joyous occasion.  But I must admit, I was just a little bit melancholy realizing he would be forging his path alone without my watchful eye.  The only blight on this very happy occasion was that my oldest son would not be joining us.  My oldest son is unwell and everyone missed his presence. We decided to go to a steakhouse for dinner.  We spend the evening talking about my son's future plans and goals.  All of the adults offered very sage advice for getting through the first year of college.  My nephew had some pretty good advice for him.  My nephew graduated from the university my son will attend 10 years ago.  I watch my son bask in everyone's praise and admiration for doing so well in high school and for getting into the university of his choice.  We concluded the evening by having cake and ice cream at the steakhouse.  The waiters served the cake with their campy birthday chorus which embarrassed my son.  It was nice to get together with close family for a happy occasion for one.  The last time we were altogether was for a sad occasion.  A close relative had died.",,3C5W7UE9CGCKIC8NVUBU82TES8EMXU
