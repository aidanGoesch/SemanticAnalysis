But i never felt like she was because she was always smiling.  She was always good at hiding pain.  My father was never that nice of a man.  He was always more interested in drinking and partying.  Rather than staying home and being a family man.  But she was always there for me.  Even if it inconvenienced her. She would still help if she could.  So i decided to care for her until six years after i started to watch over her.  I went to a friends house to hang out and spill tea. That's when i got a phone call from the hospital.  while i was gone my mother had a heart attack.  i rushed to the hospital to only get there too late... she had already past away.  I couldn't help but wonder if i was there, if i could have helped her and she'd still be here with me.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHF7VYUA
