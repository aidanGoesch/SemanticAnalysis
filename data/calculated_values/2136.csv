For the past six years I was the caretaker for my sick, elderly mother. She had been in and out of various hospitals due to her illnesses. Although I knew it would be a difficult undertaking, because I was really close to her, I decided that I would take care of her full time. We moved in together and I took care of her daily needs. However, I had to watch as her condition started to slowly get worse. She began to lose her ability to walk and was forced to use a wheelchair. And next, her mental capacity began to deteriorate as well. Still, I tried my best to care for her and to give her an enjoyable life, like she deserved. There were ups and downs to the whole situation, but I thought that overall everything was under control. That was until unexpectedly, one day, she needed me to call an ambulance for her. That was the last time I was able to speak to her. She was rushed to the hospital, and had to be put into a medically induced coma, from which she never woke up from. Losing her was such an unexpected event in my life. Suddenly I felt more alone than I had ever been. Nothing could have prepared me for this situation, and even now, I still am feeling the effects. To say that I feel sad about the situation is an understatement. I wish that I could have her back, even for a short while.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHF7VYUA
