The kicker of all of this is we went with (2) of our best friends who were also celebrating their 15th anniversary as well.  We had the best time!  No schedules, no kids, just snorkeling, laying by the pool and beach, drinking beverages with umbrellas in them...just a great time.  We were both a little skeptical on how the trip would be with another couple, but it was great.  There was enough time spent together that made it fun, but we often went our separate ways to allow for time with just my wife and I.  Our room had the best view. We were able to look down on the pools and people watch, and have the view of the coast were the crystal clear blue water lapped against the shoreline.  The balcony wasn't as good as we wanted, but still allowed us to have breakfast out there and have some privacy as well.  One funny thing that happened was my wife had a small reaction to something, and her lips puffed up fairly large!  The swelling went away pretty quickly, but it was funny when it happened. This was a trip we planned on for years.  We debated where to go for months and months, and I am glad we went to the Bahamas.  The people were great, service was nice and the weather was outstanding.  The time that I got to spend with my wife with no worries or cares was life changing for us.  We were able to talk, relax and make our connection deeper and better than it already was.  I can't wait to see what we do for anniversary number 20, and what adventures we will experience then.",3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHHWRYUM,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHHWRYUM
