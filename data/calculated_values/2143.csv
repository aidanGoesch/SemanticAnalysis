The visitor center is wonderful, with a panoramic display room showing the projections of the stones. As you stand in the middle of this room, you can watch a projection of the sunrise and sunset at various significant times of the year, and how it looks through the various alignments of the stones. There is a replica Neolithic village, and all of the displays are hands-on, with a knowledgeable interpreter to tell you what it is you're touching. There is a modern replica of one of the big sarcen stones, from the same quarry as the originals, on a sort of sled made of logs. It has a rope running to a meter. As you tug on the rope, it tells you how many more people you need on your rope to make the sled move. (It takes about 100 strong adults to move the sled.)The stone circle itself is both larger and smaller than I'd imagined it would be. The stones are huge, and crowded together, but the ring looks so small on the top of its hill. There is nothing around the hilltop for some distance, and the visitor center is hidden down over the edge of the hill a short distance away.  Of course, the route out of the centre back to the parking lot led through the gift shop. I resisted the impulse to pick up a ""Stonehenge ROCKS"" T-shirt. After the visit, we went to a nearby pub for lunch. I had fish and chips, and cider. It was a delightful day in a historic area of England.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQRCYU6
