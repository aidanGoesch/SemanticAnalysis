He has been really trying to hang in there and is getting better by the day. I think the doctors visits are starting to take it's toll, but the medical staff is trying it's best to get him healthy again. There has been plenty of test done. Since this has been such an uphill process, I thought it would be nice to buy our nurses and doctor lunch, just to show our appreciation.  Although this has been an ongoing thing, we refuse to give up. We finally received some good news, he was prescribed medication and this has helped control the condition. It can get challenging though remembering which ones to take. I like to keep him positive and do anything I can to make him less distressed. On the side I do my own research on his condition, trying to find little ways to make the day better. At other times it seems discouraging that he may never be one hundred percent healthy. We have made some lifestyle changes in order to just feel better. We eat healthy and get more exercise. These times I find it really helpful for my husband to have a good support system. He know that he is not alone.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQT1YUZ
