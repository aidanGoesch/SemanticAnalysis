After several at home remedies and over the counter topical medications didn't work, we decided it was time for him to see a doctor to diagnose the cause of the rash and why it kept getting worse. The provider gave him prescriptions for oral steroids, and told him to take an OTC antihistamine. He followed the orders and took his medication. It started to get better but didn't fully heal or go away. He then returned to the Dr's office, once again received steroids, an H2 blocker and told to use antihistamine cream on the rash. Same as the previous time he went to the Dr, within three to four days after the medication ended, the rash came back. Finally his PCP referred him to a dermatologist. He was given a diagnosis, but was told it could be something that may never go away, or could resolve on its own in time. He also had to go through a lot of other diagnostic tests to rule out heart disease as this condition can be due to poor circulation. He received two steroid injections and prescription strength cream. He is getting better, but the rash still flares up from time to time and it is frustrating for both of us. I want to help him and there is nothing I can do to fix this problem. He is irritated because he is usually never sick and he is tired of going to the Dr all the time and just wants a cure for something that they don't even know why it has happened. I hope that this resolves itself over time and that my spouse doesn't have continue suffering.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQT1YUZ
