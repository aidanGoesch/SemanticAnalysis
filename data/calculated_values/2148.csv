Working from home takes a lot of self-discipline. Before I become a remote worker, make sure I have a good system for keeping myself organiozed and on task. Use whatever works for i make a bullet journal organize my duties on trello keep pa detailed google calendar with calendly for setting meetings. Just make sure i have a self management scheme that keeps i going. I really like the new focused collection from Erin Condren. Many work from home jobs that i find will require me to sit at my computer for long periods each day.  So its super important that i have a comfortable space to work. Even if its just a comfortable chair pulled up to an old table thats the right height or a spot on my couch put some thoughtfulness for my future self into my home office. Companies that hire for work from home there are so many large companies that hire remote workers to work online. We are talking about everyone from small mom and pop shops that cant afford the overhead of office space and health insurance to fortune 500 companies like Amazon and Apple. Those companies actually hire people to work from home. The larger the company the more requirements and prerequisites they likely have in place. Thats not necessarily a bad thing. Even though i may need a newer computer they may be offer health insurance and a full time schedule. There's always a trade off know that more scheduling freedom and flexibility and less management oversight may mean lesser pay or no benefits. Ways of making money online that may be overlooking when it come to ways of making money online our minds usually head straight to things like customer service for a company such as the company or blogging because that's what everybody is doing right. Well there are so many options in between that i may be overlooking. Some of the ideas we are talking about today will allow  me to use my knowledge interests and experience to make money. Because these are areas i know it may not take much to get myself set up for success. Our first overlooked opportunity is selling my knowledge, In this instance we are talking about creating a course or eBook that i can make available for purchasing online. Because of the automation available today I may be able to put in the work once when creating my packaged information and then enjoy those checks coming in for months or years to come. I love referral and affiliate marketing. It's where the vast majority of my income comes from these days. Even if i aren't a blogger i can get in on the action as well.",,3C8HJ7UOP8G9N782WCZF5N9PJZKMZ0
