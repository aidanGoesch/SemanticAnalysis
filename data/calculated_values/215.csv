I've already told you about all the fun we had, how amazing the Falls themselves were, but I haven't told you about my own personal fall.  I guess I've been looking over my shoulder, still nervous that they might change their mind and come after me and lock me up.  It's just not like me to get in trouble with the law. The Falls were good, the shopping was good, but something happened when we went out to eat that first night.  Maybe it was the excitement of seeing the Falls, the rush of all that water, the exciting splash of water on my arms, making the hair stand on end.  The gentle kiss of the wet breeze on my face.  We decided to spend a little more than usual on dinner and go someplace fancy. It wasn't just fancy, it was elegant, refined.  It was the most romantic dinner we'd been to since our honeymoon.  We started with a glass of champaign, split a bottle of red wine during the meal, and then got lured by the waiter into trying something afterwards, a nice Canadian port he recommended. It was amazing.  Like velvet on our tongues.  I've never been really, really drunk before like that.  We stumbled back to our room and had an amazing night.  Something really came alive in my husband, and in me.  It was my first time with a hangover, but it was a night of many firsts, for both of us. We loaded up with several bottles of that port before heading home again.  I'm always nervous crossing the border, thinking about how hard it was for grandma.  Maybe part of me feels like there's always a chance they may change their mind about us, see the mistake they made with her, and keep us all out forever.  My heart was pounding when they pulled us over for inspection, and stopped dead when they found the port.  It was too much! I've never been so ashamed.  The looks the guards gave us were devastating.  I may not have a criminal record from this, but I feel permanently unsettled, like I enjoyed myself too much to live up to the legacy of my grandmother.",,31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNBU4175
