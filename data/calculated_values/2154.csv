We were supposed to be home, while my children's father was working. However, his boss ended up giving him the day off at the last minute. Because of this, we decided to do something fun with our last day of the weekend. There were plenty of places that were closer to us than six flags, being that six flags was three hours from us. However, we hadn't been there in many years, and our children had never been. So, we decided to go there. It was so much fun, and our children loved every ride they were able to go on. The only thing that was hard was that we didn't have much time before closing time.  The lines were ridiculously long, and we didn't have the flash pass. We did get two free skip the line tickets each though, so that worked out okay for the most part. We also got some fries with cheese to eat, and the cheese was the best thing ever! Being a member of the park, we were also treated to free soft drinks all day long at the park. Overall, it was an amazing family outing! I can't wait to do it again sometime soon!",3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA851597,3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA851597
