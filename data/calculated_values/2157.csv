I had previously had heart surgery and the incision site did not close properly, so I was susceptible to infection. I had strep in my blood, which is way different than having strep throat and if not treated quickly, can be deadly. I ended up in the hospital for a little over a week. I had to undergo 2 different procedures called a debridement to clean out the infection and make sure it wouldn't spread any further. It was very hard on me emotionally. It had been a rough couple of months trying to recover from the initial heart surgery. To add that onto everything, I was beyond overwhelmed. I'd already missed a ton of work and so had my husband. I worried about both our jobs. I worried about financial issues. Mostly, I worried about our children. We have 2 young daughters. I know my husband is more than capable of caring for them, but I'm their Mom.  All of this happened during flu season, so the hospital had restrictions in place. No children were allowed. I told my husband to just stay home and take care of the girls so I didn't have very many visitors when I was there. I felt a little guilty about enjoying the peace and quiet of the hospital. I mostly watched Netflix and slept. I don't get to do that at home. I came home with a wound vac right in the center of my chest and a PICC line running continuous antibiotics for almost 2 months. It sucked in the worst way but I've finally healed and things are looking way better now.",3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA998VAI7N,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA998VAI7N
