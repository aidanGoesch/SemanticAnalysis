A group of kids from his team decided to register a team but they purposefully left my son out. I am good friends with the mother who organized the team. I knew there were issues between our boys lately but still this hurt me very much. After the tournament I have approached her and had a conversation with her about issues between our boys. She said that she felt my son is aggressive towards her twin boys and that she is genuinely worried about their well-being. This has hurt me even more. But I agreed to get the boys together and have them talk things out. After that it seems they managed to resolve their issues mostly and are getting along much better now. However, I cannot get myself to warm up to this mother again. I have though about this for long and prayed for peace but I just can't let it go. I mean she has excluded us purposefully. I am sure she was aware how much it will hurt my son and me. She has been trying to reconnect but I can't get myself to do it. I hope I will be able to move on.",,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99G9LI7Y
