It was a long drive from our New England home but it was worth the effort; it was my first time seeing the Falls and it was breath taking. I loved the sound of the Falls, the depth of it and the length of the waterfall itself. During our vacation my husband and I stayed in a hotel room at The Hilton. Although the hotel was large and clean our room was next to the stair well and was very noisy so we did not sleep well. Despite that we still enjoyed ourselves. During the vacation we had a high quality steak dinner at a beautiful restaurant, visited the casino and walked around the mall. We didn't win anything at the casino! During our trips to the mall we sampled hot sauces (bought some) and sampled the local wine which I found to be very sweet tasting. It was at this mall that I bought a dress for an upcoming wedding. It was at this mall where we saw the food critic during dinner: We had just placed our food order when a lady sat down behind us and ordered several items from the menu. She also asked questions and asked to be re-seated twice. It was obvious she was a restaurant critic. We asked her who she worked for but she just laughed and wouldn't say. On the way home we stopped at the duty free store and bought some Canadian whisky and a bottle of the wine we had sampled. However, we had been ill informed about the amount of alcohol we could bring into the US and we were stopped at immigration and had to pay duty on the alcohol!",,31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNBU4175
