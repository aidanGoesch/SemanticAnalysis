I have known Tommy since he was born. I grew up across the street from his family. I am actually best friend friends with his older brother, Matt. His sisters Cindy and Jill like sisters to me. And Tommy is like a younger brother to me. Growing up as an only child, Matt and Tommy's family were like my second family. Anyway, this was their second child. Their daughter is 5. Tommy is considerably older than his wife. And it was surprising that he wanted to have another child when he is in his late forties, but when he called me to tell me his son had been born, he was ecstatic. The real reason I believe is that he wanted a son. He was very close to his dead who just passed away a couple of years ago. Now that his son has been born, he is very excited about all of the father and son activities he plans to do with him. Like teaching him how to play hockey. This was a big part of his life growing up. All of his family played including his sister Cindy who played in college. Teaching him to do things on the lake where they live and Tommy and I actually grew up. Things like fishing and canoeing. Also maybe even water skiing if Tommy isn't too old by then :). It brings a smile to my face every time I think about all the wonderful times I spent with Tommy's family. I am so happy for him and his wife. I look forward to watching his son grow into a man.",3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99GJSI7P,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99GJSI7P
