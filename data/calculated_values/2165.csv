I am arrogant too. Due to this I don't have many friends. I took many steps to change this attitude but I can't. My friends suggested to listen to mild music so that my mood can change. I even tried that too. Once one of my friend suggested to go to a debaucherous music festival. Though I was not interested I went there. The festival ran on a ""do what thou will"" unregulated ethos. At first I did not like to hear it. Even I thought of going home in the middle. But when the time passed by I liked the theme. At one time I experienced a change in myself. After coming home that thoughts made me a tolerant person. It made me tolerant so that I was clear in making choices and well behave with others.",,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99J2VI7X
