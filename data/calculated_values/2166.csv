I've always been an introverted person by nature. Due to my generally unsociable personality, I was skeptical about the extroverted and bombastic vibe of a festival. I wasn't convinced I could click with a large community of strangers given my temperament. I knew however that going to such an event could be what I needed to break out of my shell. I was shocked at the kindness directed towards first-timers and how easy it was to integrate into the community. The general theme of the festival was one of self-regulation - there was no central authority or rules. Thus, there was a general theme of unchecked hedonism, essentially people were left to their own devices and allowed to do whatever they wanted. The only real rule was simply to not attack or detriment the community, which was left to police itself. It reminded me of anarcho-communist, de-centralized conceptual communities, but in this regard I was able to watch those ideas play out in person. The festival was peaceful and a fun time for everyone involved despite the lawless nature of it and it made me optimistic that ideas like these could succeed on a larger scale. I was able to express myself in ways I had never gotten to previously. It stripped me of my gut apprehension towards things like public nudity by it being so ubiquitous that it resulted in desensitization. I also had an apprehension towards hedonic things like public sex and open drug use, but it was so wide-spread that it became a footnote, like background noise. Exposing myself to a culture like that opened my mind and expanded my capabilities for tolerance towards others and behavior that runs contrary to my own day to day experience. Thus, I think the extreme nature of that festival made me a more robust and tolerant person, and less tightly-wound.",,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99J2VI7X
