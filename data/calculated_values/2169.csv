I regret not paying closer attention to my funds. I was so foolish! This could have been prevented if I was more careful. I can't believe we were in this position. Thankfully, after a lot of hunting, we found a home to rent that fits my budget. It's even in a better neighborhood! I feel extremely lucky to have this outcome. I can't wait to entirely settle in. There is still a lot of unpacking to do. Everyone that I've met in the neighborhood has been so pleasant. I will definitely be monitoring my finances much better to avoid going through this experience again. I've purchased software that will track my spending. I am eager for this new chapter. I am feeling positive overall.",,3CFVK00FWM7NTF66UV1P8C152DLL6S
