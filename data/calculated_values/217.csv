I read online about all the options for blocking windows. I liked the idea of installing a birdbath. I read all the tips about how to do it.

I spent 3 weekends building the entire thing, but it was perfect. I  had finally won and could reclaim my window from the neighbor. Unfortunately, I had underestimated how much work it really was to build the bath. After I finished I was unable  to walk normally for a month. My back is finally starting to feel better.
