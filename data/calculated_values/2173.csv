When we arrived I arrived at another that was not my destination since the plane made a stop due to turbulence. and I didn't realize because of the dream. It turns out that we had to take another flight and I was already late, when I finally reached my destination I didn't find my credit cards. I left them in my apartment another fault when I arrived at the reception I see that my suitcase went in the taxi. what else would happen to me I noticed that in the same hotel there was also a friend. and I said salvation, I will talk to him to tell him what happened to me. We had a cup of coffee and laughed at everything that had happened to me. He offered to pay me all the expenses of the trip and I said thank you God because in spite of the bad always something good comes out. In those things of life one wonders if there really are friends. We went sightseeing and bought clothes for me. then we went out to dinner and meet a girls of the nightWe had sex and we gave them hard in the ass. We arrived and slept and laughed at everything that had happened.
