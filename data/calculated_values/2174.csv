Until then i have been brushing up on my skills and finding new ways to make some cash. I have found amny new ways to do things. I have even lost some weight and find myself getting into better shape becuase ihave mroe time to workout. I find myself doing more things i like and i also feel more at peace not havign to waste my time at a place i hate knowing that i will never get the kind of money from them that i desevre becuase they are running a sloppy business that will not work in the long run. I am am feeling free and more and mroe at peace everyday and have set new standards form myslef in regerds to the jobs i am willing to do. I feel i am at least worth 15. 00 per hr and will not even applt for jobs that pay less. I will have everyweek off becuase i have a life outside of work and to be honest as soon as i leave work i don't care about the place or coworkers there. While i understand the need to work i often view it as as waste of time so i am steady growning my side hustles so i can leave work behind becuase my life i better without it. Finally i relize that office politics is a part of the work world and sadly i realize i will have to play it even if i only do it sometimes i realize that most managers are nothing but small mind morons that simply do as they are told and cannot think of different ways to do stuff so i will play nice so to speak and not let them know i see there grand places and nothing mroe that fails waiting to happen. I thin kthat people where not meant to work away there lives jsut for a worthless paycheck. I will find away out of the system no matter how long it takes. Until then I will just sit back and let the fail happen. iI will make a great show and i do love a good laught every now and then. Humans are funny animals becuase they believe that everything must be earned.,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJN8NMY4G,
