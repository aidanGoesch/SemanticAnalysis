However my 4th of july was different this year because i got a lot more vaction time because i was laid off. The sad thing about it was that i knew it was coming as i saw one by one people not showing up to work and the comapny not doing well and getting further and futher in the red to spit me making suggestion atfer suggestion and just getting ingored and micromanged to death. As people left my work load increased daily and i when from simply listing items to picking them, packing them, formatting hard drives, answer customer calls, and helping out more and more with the warehouse. This just let me know that companies don't care about you and you cannot even depend on them for a job. Managers are also the most useless job there but of course they still have there jobs becuase they are the one thing i will never be and that is a yes man. I tried it for awhile there but just could not bring myself to agreeing to bad idea atfer bad idea. I often wonder how long it will be, before they go under. Then again i dont really care becuase it seems all they cared about was getting over on customer and offereing cheap products for sale. They would often blame the customers for missuse and not help honest hard working people when an item they spend $200. 00 just broken. the warehosue was a mess of a place and not really fit for people to work in and it seemed no one cared becuase everyime it was cleaned up it when right back to being a mess again. Of curose since i worked in the office i had to deal with the suck ups and micromaning that drove me crazy and i would do warehosue stuff whenever i coudl to get away from it. Atfer a while i think they where just trying to push me out becuase i was not a yes man and suck up. I maybe quit but i spend my mind and that is just a no no in corprate america where the boss is always rght and you are always wrong. I am not focsing on bigger and better things and know they will workout for the better.",3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJN8NMY4G,
