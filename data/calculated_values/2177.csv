This year we decided to go to Universal Studios during our company event. My company buys out the place for a few days and only company employees get to attend after a certain time of night. We had a wonderful time going around the park enjoying all of the attractions. However, the Walking Dead walk-through attraction was closed for most of the day. My kids were disappointed because it was something they had been looking forward to. When we heard that they were going to reopen it at 10 p.m., we made sure we were first in line. We were queued at the front waiting, but when they opened the doors, they let a woman through in a wheelchair with her family first. The woman was clearly upset. She was cussing and calling her family members names, saying that they were forcing her to go through the attraction. We all laughed it off and gossiped for a minute. But after a few minutes, we were allowed to go through. About halfway through the attraction the fire alarm suddenly went off and all of the lights popped on. At first we thought it was part of the fun house and didn't know what to do. But when I seen one zombie start to climb out and then panic and back up real slowly, I realized it was real. I looked all around with my kids for the emergency exit, but I couldn't find it. I said out loud, ""Where do we go?"" And a zombie still in full character slugs his arm to the right and points to the emergency exit. We started laughing so hard when we went out. One zombie started saying, ""what do we do?"" When we got out, we heard that the woman in the wheelchair panicked and threw the alarm. It was hilarious and we all had a good memory out of it.",3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNAE44YO,
