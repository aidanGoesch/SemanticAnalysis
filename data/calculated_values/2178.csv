We went in June, which was about a month ago. I took all five of my children and my husband went. We go during my work's night at the theme park. My work buys out the park once a year and it is all people from my work sites that attend. It is a special event and there are a lot of extras like photo booths and face painting and things like that. We enjoy getting to go on all of the rides a lot faster and have the park not be very crowded. What was really memorable is that the Walking Dead ride was closed for the majority of the night. When it opened it was very late in the evening, but we made ourselves second in line. There was a woman in a wheel chair getting wheeled in  by her family just before us and she was mad and cussing that she had to go. Part way through the whole ride shut down and the lights came on. They told us to go to the emergency exits, but what was funny is zombies were running around not knowing what to do. Some were pointing at the emergency exits still in character. It was hilarious. I guess the woman in the wheelchair freaked out and pulled the alarm.",3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNAE44YO,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNAE44YO
