My favorite is Strawberry Shortcake. I have been searching for these since as far back as I can remember.  About two months ago, I found this niftly little store. It was called Caddy Corner. I thought I'd give it a try and go look. I was extremely busy that day. But I took a little time for myself since I deserve it. I looked around the store. What do I see in the corner? Dolls, everwhere dolls! Right in the mddle of all these dolls was a batch of Strawberry Shortcake dolls. I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I quickly grabbed them and rushed to the counter in disbelief. I bought all of the dolls. This was a once in a lifetime find and I am the most happy woman you will ever see.",,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNHHQY4H
