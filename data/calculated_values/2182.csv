I collect Strawberry Shortcake dolls. I have a bunch of dolls in my collection. This made my collection more complete. I like to look at it. It is really nice. I will never find dolls like this again. A lot of them are in the box. The minis even have cards with them. I also got some vehicles. I got a mini house in a box. I have the mini house of my own from when I was a kid. I don't have none of my boxes or packaging. So to have so many in the box is cool. They actually still have the scent from the 1980's which is a miracle for how old they are.,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNHHQY4H,
