The woman had a bunch of strawberry shortcake dolls. Maybe they were her daughters? That is what I collect. I have been collecting them since I was a kid. I was so happy. There were priced reasonably too. I bought them right away. I took them home and put them in my collection. I arranged them nicely. I was so proud of them. I can't believe I found them. I have been going to yard sales for 2 decades and never found nothing like this. I was so excited. I will never find nothing like this again. This is my treasure. This is what I go to yard sales for. I am amazed and very happy to have found them.,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNHHQY4H,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNHHQY4H
