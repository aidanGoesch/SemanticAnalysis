Looking for a job seems so much more lazy than it was in the past.  I remember carefully typing my resume and my cover letter, and then I would go to Schmitty's, our small coastal town's local supply store of anything of important. This is where I would pick up my resume paper of the correct feel, weight, and texture.  I would be able to go into an office and hand in my carefully organized work. Now, the task is very simple, but very impersonal.  My resume and cover letter are downloaded into a massive database, and employers have the task of picking out a candidate from this massive sea of pdfs they receive. I know I have skills that many possess, nothing about my education or experience are particularly exceptional. This is why, and it seemed out of the blue, when I got a job offer to work as a customer service representative for my favorite brand, Apple, I was floored. These were my job requirements going into my search. I needed appropriate training, a minimum of $15 an hour and benefits.  I didn't need full benefits, just health benefits. Apple exceeded my expectations.  They offered me $20 an hour with full benefits, regular training, and they give me unlimited support.  I am still pinching myself over my good fortune. You wouldn't think that working remotely would be a dream environment, but it is so nice to have a home and work balance with no travel time. This will be life changing for me and my family, and I will no longer worry about my financial situation.",,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNRI84YH
