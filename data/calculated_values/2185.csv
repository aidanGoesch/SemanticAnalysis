I was working as a contractor in a different state and a consultant called if to understand I am interested. I said yes casually. He followed up and tried to arrange for interview. I traveled for in-person interviews twice in that month and it was difficult to stay away from work and to be away at office. Some colleagues and boss were suspecting that I was looking out.  I had tough time scheduling an interview. HR has already changed 2 dates. Finally, I found a random date and I was expected to attend in person. Due to my schedule, the company allowed me to take it through screen sharing. It worked well. I did not like one of the interviewer's style. The consultant explained me the miscommunication and got the recruiter talk to me. Then, it was a smooth affair. It a surprising development, it is in destiny.",,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNRI84YH
