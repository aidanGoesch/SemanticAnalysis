I wanted this to be a special event because he was turning 5 years old.  There was going to be so many family and friends there and i wanted it to be special.  I hired a magician to come to the birthday party.  This made the party so much fun and my son was so happy.  I remember seeing him smile so much.  Another thing i remember is when he openend his presents he was smiling so much.  He had friends over as well and they had a blast.  When they saw the magician doing tricks everyone was laughing so much.  It was a blessing to plan this party for my son. I cant wait for next year to setup his next party. I have so many new ideas for next year.  My son keeps talking about a new ipad. I already bought the ipad for him.  I plan on giving it to him for his 6th birthday party!,,3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF7216PKV
