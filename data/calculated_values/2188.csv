Michael and I had been looking forward to this day and we were scared because we were not ready in a way. Would I like the teacher? Would they instill confidence in their ability to take care of OUR baby boy with whom I almost trusted no one? Thankfully I have been talking about this with my therapist and support group. I can barely imagine my mom feeling any way similar when I was a child. It was surreal to be in a position to take care of a tiny child for the first time. I want him to be happy. I want him to be healthy. Most importantly I want him to know that he is loved. Michael and I may not be perfect, but we sure try our best. We didn't have the best childhoods so we want him to. I am getting nervous but I think I will be okay. I have my camera ready and I will be documenting this. I hope Chad enjoys it. I hope we are okay. We will be okay.",,3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF787MPKT
