His truck is huge and completely blocks my window. The only window that I have that is able to be opened. My cat tree sits in front of it. The cats look out it and look a birds or other things going on there. When I asked him about parking there he kind of shrugged it off and let me know he had no intention of not parking there anymore. So I made a decision to go buy a birdbath and put it in front of that window on my area of property. I purchased the birdbath. It was huge. Weighed about 100lbs. I killed my back lifting it into the cart. I hurt my back so badly I could not get it out of the cart and into my car. I had to have someone from the store do it for me. I asked my neighbor to please move his truck sometime that week so that I could install the birdbath. He got furious, started going off about property lines and blah blah blah.  I remained calmed and I showed him the property line and said nicely, didnt mean to upset you, I just want to install a birdbath on my property in front of my cat window. So with the help of my roommates walker with a seat on it, I was able to move the heavy birdbath from car to where I was putting it in. I was suprised at how smoothly that went. I now have a nice birdbath, and no huge monsterous truck blocking my window, the birds have water and my cats have more things to watch.",31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNRAP718,31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNRAP718
