Well, not so much the event itself, but my reaction to it. Am I bad mother? A bad person?? Okay, let me start over from the beginning. A week ago, last Monday, my little baby boy (not so little anymore!) Henry got on the big yellow school bus for the first time ever and headed off to his very first day of Kindergarten. As I watched him go, I felt a weird mixture of feelings, one of which was relief. Relief??? I'm not supposed to feel relief!!! I'm supposed to be heartbroken and nostalgic, thinking how different things will be without him around the house. Looking at his little un-played-with toys. Missing his voice and constant questions. Thumbing through old photo albums and marveling at how it was practically just yesterday that he was taking his first steps and saying his first words. Now I'm not saying that I didn't have those feelings, of course I did. I mean, I'm not a complete psychopath. But shouldn't that be the end of the story? Am I terrible for being a little bit glad that I'm going to have a few question-free hours to breathe and decompress? Is this normal? Am I selfish? Is this a sign of a bad mother? Ugh. Nobody told me that motherhood was going to have THIS many worries in it.",,3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF7B1IKPB
