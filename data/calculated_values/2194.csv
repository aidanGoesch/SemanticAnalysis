About seven weeks ago, Henry, started Kindergarten.  It was his first day of elementary school, and since he is my oldest child, it was my first day of Kindergarten as well.  We woke up a little bit early that day to make sure that we had plenty of time to get ready.  When I woke up my son, you could tell that he was excited but nervous about starting school.  We began our morning with a big hug, and then I started helping him get ready.  We had already picked out his clothes the night before, so he got dressed while I made him a special breakfast.  By the time that he was dressed, it was time to eat.  We sat at the kitchen table and ate pancakes together, while his brother and sister were still sleeping in their beds.  After eating, he brushed his teeth and combed his hair, while I got his siblings out of bed and dressed.  At this point, it was time to head outside to wait for the bus.  We all stood at the end of the driveway and stared down the street looking for the big yellow school bus.  Soon we could see it driving down our street.  I looked into my son's eyes, and I could see that he was starting to get nervous again.  We all gave him a big hug, as the school bus pulled up.  He started climbing up the stairs and turned around to look back at us.  I snapped a couple of pictures as he disappeared into the vehicle.  He sat down in one of the seats next to a window and we all waved goodbye.  Tears filled my eyes as the bus pulled away, not because I was sad but out of pride and love for my son.",3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF7B1IKPB,
