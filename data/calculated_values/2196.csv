So when we were able to go it truly was a dream come true. The whole time that we were there the weather was amazing. I went with my boyfriend. My favorite site to see was Buckingham Palace. I am a huge fan of the royals so this was quite exciting for me. The English countryside was so charming that it made me wish I could just move there. Madame Tussauds was very interesting. I wanted to stay there forever. Riding the London Eye was quite thrilling. I took so many pictures that I had to download them every night to make room on the camera for the next day. I had always imagined the English people as being kind of stuck up. I was quite surprised that our experiences were the opposite of that. Everyone was warm and friendly. I saw one section of London that reminded of a scene out of the movie Mary Poppins. This was fun as that is one of my favorite movies. This was an adventure of a lifetime and something that I will never forget.,,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOW0I325O
