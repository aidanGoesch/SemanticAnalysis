I had always wanted to visit England and finally got the chance. I was so excited. This was the trip of a lifetime. The flight over was very comfortable and I couldn't wait to arrive. London was amazing. It's such a big, lively city. It's also very unique. I visited all the tourist destinations. We had an amazing time! One of my favorite experiences while there was visiting Buckingham Palace. I also loved visiting Madame Tussaud's and riding on the London Eye. The shopping there was great too. I bought clothes in lots of fun UK stores. I enjoyed the food, the people and especially the accents! I honestly had the time of my life.",,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOW0I325O
