We decided to celebrate the occasion.  We made a whole day out of it with different activities.  We spent some time to ourselves.  We also chose to spend some time with our children as well.  We see them as an integral part of our family.  Our children are what shaped our family into what it is today.  That is why we felt it was important to spend time with them on that day too.  They are our world.  My husband and I also spent some time reflecting and thinking about our last 10 years together.  We have been through many ups and many downs.  We have always come out together in the end.  We support each other.  I feel as though we have a strong relationship and have each other's backs.  Making our 10 year wedding anniversary a celebration was important to remember that.  I can't wait to see what the next 10 years has to offer us.,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOW2YT52F,
