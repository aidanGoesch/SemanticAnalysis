I found out I was having a child. For me, having a child was just one of those things that normal people do but was never going to happen for me. I always felt too..something. Too young in my mind, too irresponsible. Just not good enough. How could someone that fucks up life so much, have a child? Of course I know that lots of people who don't have their life together have children. It happens all the time. But I've always just felt different. I never even though I would find someone to have sex with me. But there I was, hearing the news that I was actually going to join the normal human club. This immediately made me think about my own father. One of the most annoying, arrogant, frustrating, people I ever knew. Also my favorite person in the world. Losing him was devastating to me. But suddenly I felt like, me having a child was honoring him in some way. That maybe now I got to be him. I would teach my child the things my father taught me. Correct the mistakes of my father. I found out I was having a little girl. From that moment on, my life was no longer mine. It was hers. I knew no matter what kind of parent I was going to be, everything from that moment on was for her.",,31Q0U3WYDQ1T78G7KVOYUBSNZ7K715
