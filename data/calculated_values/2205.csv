Our ceremony was held at a winery in Livermore, California.  I would have to say that this was the best day of my life and probably will be the most memorable day as well. Our ceremony was held outside overlooking the vineyard.  My family and friends and her family and friends were in attendance.  The ceremony was short but very sweet. I just remember looking into her eyes and seeing the love that she has for me.  After the ceremony cocktails were served and around 5 PM people started to sit in their seats.  The wedding party was then introduced.  We stat down and had a good dinner.  Afterwards the maid of honor and my best man gave their speeches which contained the most embarrassing stories for my wife and my past. The story my brother, the best man, told caught me off guard and I was shocked and surprised and embarrassed all at the same time.  After a few good laughs everyone headed for the dance floor.  Around this time I started to reflect on how amazing it was for all of these people to take time out of their busy lives and come and celebrate with us. After a few hours of dancing an mingling everyone started to head for home or back to their hotels.  My bride and I went back to our hotel and had a few good laughs about or experience that day.  This is a memory that will last with me for as long as I live.",,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWCUP25A
