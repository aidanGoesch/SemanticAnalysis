I'm so excited to announce that I HAVE MOVED out of my FAMILY'S house and INTO MY OWN APARTMENT! I can't believe it finally happened! It's the cutest little one bedroom flat, overlooking downtown too! It has this perfect little breakfast nook tucked behind the kitchen that's perfect for reading, or now writing in this. I think it'll be the perfect little spot to do homework in the evenings. I've been doing some shopping for decorations and things, and I think I'm leaning mostly towards teal and pink, maybe some gold. A girl has to have some glitter in her life. I have the best balcony, so I'm waiting for dad to build me a flower box to put out there. I bought some begonias, so for now they're just soaking up the sunshine out there. I found some cute canvases, so maybe I'll try my hand at some oil painting and spruce it up some more. The grocery store is just right around the corner, but carrying all the groceries up eight flights of stairs is starting to annoy me. Maybe I should buy less at a time. The one thing I miss about being at home, is mom doing my laundry for me. I never realized how much I despise doing my own laundry. I can't do much at a time either because carrying them up and down the stairs is a pain. Maybe I should find a laundry service near me. Work is also one block away and that helps considering my commute was over twenty minutes before. I'm enjoying this newfound freedom so much! I guess I should get back to hanging up some pictures and frames, maybe some cooking. I'll write again soon :)",,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWSNZ25M
