He is from  Mexico and still has a lot of family that live there, including his parents. So in a matter of two days, it was determined that we would make the 18 hour car ride to visit his home town and family. Thankfully, we had all gotten our passports the year before, so that headache was out of the way. I had to book the dog into an area kennel, but first had to get her vaccines up to date. Then I had to go about trying to pack up myself and 3 children. And my husband who is like a child most of the time anyhow. Finally we were on the way for the long trip. We made it to the border in good time, and actually got our permits and crossed the border all in about a half hour. This was the most surprising even of the whole trip there, because I remember multiple times when we have been stuck for almost five hours by border patrol, so this was a blessing. Once we got further into central Mexico, the scenery was really gorgeous. The air had cooled down, and the mountains were beautiful. We got to his town around 10pm and were welcomed by the cross that shines on the mountain, or La Bufa, in his city. It was really pretty and I was glad that we decided to make the trip. The children were exhausted, and cranky from being in the truck for almost an entire day. We stopped at a street vendor when we were coming into the city, and got tacos. Let me tell you, they try to do street tacos in Texas, but nothing is better than the real thing. The fresh fruit waters, and tacos, and gorditas were a welcoming taste after snacking on junk for 18 hours. We got to my husband's parent's house before midnight, ready for bed. And excited about who we would see and places we would visit the next day.",3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWVV452D,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWVV452D
