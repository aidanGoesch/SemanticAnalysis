I had felt it was just a normal stomach upset so i got antibiotics. Although, this wasn't the first time I would be feeling this pain. I have actually been feeling it for some years now but I have always attributed the pain to something else. I at one point in my life felt it was as a result of wearing underwears that were to tight, So i changed them and the pains still persisted. At another time i felt it was because my belts were to tight so i reduced the rate at which i used belts all together but the pains would always come back. Then, i gave up trying to find the solutions and endured the pains, and then after a while the pains left only for it to resurface after some months but then then the antibiotics worked which made me so sure it was going to work again this time  but it didn't.So, I got antibiotics, used it and expected to feel better but things got worse. It was so bad i couldn't sleep all through the night, the following day i had started calling people as early as 3 am in the morning. When help eventually came i took antacid and still nothing improved. So i was rushed to a nearby clinic and after diagnosis, i found out i had acute appendicitis and required immediate surgery. I  had the surgery and got better. This may look like a normal write up but there is no way i would be able to express the immeasurable pains i felt in this write up. After the surgery I tried to find out the cause of my predicament, i was told a series of things, some were applicable to me and weren't but i still found everything confusing because i have friends who almost the same i do and didn't have to suffer from the pains i did. I'm happy I'm happy I'm better now though, which i feel is the most important thing.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWW0RC9NF
