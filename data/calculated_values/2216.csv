I was at home with my wife and children. We were making dinner. Suddenly a phone rang, I picked it up and heard a lady asking me if I knew what happened to my father. I immediately was at full attention. I was shocked when I heard the news. My father's girl friend  said that he had a major stroke and that he was at the hospital at that very moment. At fist I was puzzled because my father is known to be in excellent health, but I did not waste any time and told my father's girl friend to tell him that I was coming to see him. After I got off the phone I packed all of the necessary things and took the fist flight to New York to see my father. When I got there I immediately found the hospital my father was in. I took a taxi and was there in 10 minutes. I was happy to see my father but at the same time I felt bad for not being there first hand. I asked him about all the necessary information. He told me that it was a surprise for him as well because he did not see that coming. He woke up out of his sleep like that. He said he felt the negative energy around him at the time when that happened. That was an important piece of information because it helped me to put in the prospective what really happened to him. I spend 2 weeks there with him to make sure that he was able to handle himself and plus I got all of the information I needed to make sure that incident did not happen again.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWW9LXN9B
