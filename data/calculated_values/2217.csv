My phone started to buzz on the floor next to me, and I turned over to look at it to see it is my father. I figured it was just going to be able picking me up for college the next day, so I picked up and said yes dad in a werid tone giving the expression of ""not now"". The person on the phone was not my father today, it was his current girlfriend in a sad tone of voice. She told me my father suffered a major stroke and was in the hospital down the street. During this time my stomach felt like it was on the floor, and my mind went blank. I handed the phone to my mother and stared at the floor of the room in confusion about the current situation. I heard my mother's vice start to change into a sad tone as well, and she started to cry. After she got off the phone she called my sister at work, holding back tears told my sister that our father was in the hospital and she needed to come home.  It felt like hours have passed from my mother calling my sister, and her getting to our home as time felt like it was passing by slowly. When she got home we talked about what we all knew from the call, and what was happening and just started to cry. We briskly walked to the car on our way to the emergency room down the street to see my father in the state he was in. When we got to the hospital the walk to the area he was in was full of the anxiety of how he was currently. When we got to his area we saw him laying on the bed strapped up to multiple different machines to monitor him and give them medications he needed. During this time I started to have feelings of fear, and sadness throughout my mind. We spent the next hour with him, while also talking with doctors about what has happened. We ended up going home to rest, and tomorrow we will go to see him more.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWW9LXN9B
