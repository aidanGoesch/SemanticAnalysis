It was an amazing experience! When I was planning my wedding dress shopping trip, I invited my mom, sister, maid of honor, future mother-in-law, and future sister-in-law, because I wanted them to share in the experience. We made two appointments in a town near my home town for a Saturday, but there was one store that I wanted to visit that was about an hour away. So, my mom and I made a secret plan to visit the far away store, just to be sure that my dress wasn't there, but I thought that since it would be my first time trying on dresses, there would be no way that I would find my dress without the rest of my party! Well, I was wrong! My mom and I walked into the bridal salon, and while we were waiting for the bridal consultant, we both locked eyes on a dress at the same time. We decided that I should try on that dress first, because it was absolutely beautiful. When our bridal consultant came up to us, we picked a few other dresses that matched my style, but I tried on the original dress first. Even though it was beautiful, I wasn't sure if it was the one for me, so I kept trying on more. After about a dozen dresses, I tried on another dress that was exactly what I had pictured myself getting married in...but I couldn't stop thinking about the first dress! So, I tried on the first dress again, this time with a veil, and my mom and I both knew--that was the one. The best part of the story comes next, though! At this bridal salon, they allow the first bride who purchases a dress to give it a name (like a human name), and my dress had never been purchased before. So, I got to name my dress after my maternal grandmother, who died fourteen years ago, and who my mom and I miss very much. We both cried! Then, the next day, the rest of my initial wedding dress crew came back with me so they could see the dress. We all cried and drank champagne, and it was one the best experiences I've ever had!",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWZQ29N2
