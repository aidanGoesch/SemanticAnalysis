I actually knew her from high school, but it has been years since we have even seen each other at all.  We went out on a double date with a couple of my friends and really hit it off immediately.  We went to dinner in a quaint little Italian place here in my town.    It was like we had never missed any time of knowing each other at all.  !  It was really surprising how very much we still have in common, and how alike we are!  She has the same exact dry sense of humor that I do and I really like that alot about her.  She is also just as much fun as I remember her being in school.  I am really thinking and hoping that this new relationship is going to develop into something that will last a long time, as I can really envision myself spending the rest of my life with her.  She only lives in the next town over from me, which is maybe a 10 minute drive.  I am very hopeful for this and the possibility.  The friends who went on the double date with us did not hit if off nearly as great as we did.  They were just very awkward and different.  It was pretty painful to watch them trying to make small talk when my date and I just talked and laughed and had so so much fun.  I am really happy about the way things went and are going.  Wish me luck!!",,3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO95B4J7R
