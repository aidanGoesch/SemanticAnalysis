I was going to see my mother.  The main reason for the visit was that she had just had a stroke and i wanted to support her.  I remember when i got there i gave her a very big hug.  We bonded so much during the trip. I was very sad most of the time but happy to see her.  I was very grateful that the doctor said she should be okay now .  She will have to change her diet and work out more but she will be okay.  It was a very big relief to hear the doctor say that .  I plan on moving down closer to my mother soon.  I want to be there for her . I dont want her to have another stroke.  Overall i am very happy with the visit with my mother .  I do plan on also seeing her again shortly in the future.  One thing that shocked me was how much we bonded.  We talked so much about past memories from when i was a child.  We have never really bonded like this before and it was very nice  to have bonded with her.  I also remember we talked about my dad passing away and i dont want to watch my mother pass away.  I plan on helping her with work out goals and changing her diet.,,3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO9NI17J8
