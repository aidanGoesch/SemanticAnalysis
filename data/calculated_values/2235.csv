I was very excited to go. First, it was an opportunity to attend an important family event. My family is small, and so the milestone events are a big deal. The location made the ceremony quite memorable. I had never visited Washington properly. Aside from the ceremony, I got to see a lot of the city and the famous monuments. There were so many famous sites. I saw the White House (but no President, unfortunately). I saw Congress. I saw the Washington Monument. I saw the Lincoln Memorial. I saw Arlington. I saw Watergate. I saw Ford's Theatre. The only downside was that I saw the bad part of the city too. There are a lot of boarded up, homeless-infested streets. It is really unfortunate to see that in the nation's capital.",,3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO9TY5J7Q
