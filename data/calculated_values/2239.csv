We all really loved Memphis and thought it was a really cool experience.  The south is much different than where we live now in the Midwest.  This experience has motivated me and my family to want to move out of the state and to Tennessee, albeit probably somewhere different than Memphis.  We got to see our friends and stay with them in Memphis for a day on the way down and a day on the way back.  Me and my fiancee visited our friends and went out on Beale Street the first day.  It was a crazy party type of day where my fiancee danced on the bar at Coyote Ugly and we all got pretty drunk and had a lot of fun. The next day we drove to Hot Springs to visit my parents which was also pretty fun.  We got to see the city.  We also picked up our son who stayed with my parents for a few days.  Then on the way back my son got to visit with our friends.  It was a good time.  We ate barbecue at Central BBQ which was amazing and a fun time.  Overall it was a very fun trip.  We want to go back soon for sure.",3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO9TZIJ75,
