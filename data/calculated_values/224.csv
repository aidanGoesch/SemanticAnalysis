We were out of the country and he proposer had purchased the ring prior to our trip.  This was totally unexpected. I was fortunate to be able to hear the proposer ask the father for his permission.  I felt a part of the event because I was asked to help the proposer with ideas and suggestions on how to make this special for everyone.  He wanted us to be there to see it.  Even though not exactly AT the dinner.  It was exciting to help with this. It was totally unexpected to be asked to help him.  His parents weren't there so I felt special.  I enjoyed being able to input my ideas and thoughts into making this special and having his father there to witness it.  I have only been dating her father for a few months and was very excited for the couple.  Her father and I planned what food to have.  We tried to get a band as well.  We purchased an engagement gift.",31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DLPYY,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DLPYY
