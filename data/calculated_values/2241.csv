They told me that they were so happy for me and my husband that we were pregnant and expecting a baby.  My family rallied together and chipped in and donated everything that a baby could possibly need.  From clothing to baby furniture.  It was nice having my family support me in that way.  Coming together and helping me and my husband.  I would find gift cards in the mail, to little gift bags left at my home with baby stuff.  It felt really good knowing that I had support during this time.  As this was my first child.  Having my son was the biggest blessing and surprise I could ever ask for.  And having my family and friends involved in my pregnancy was the most amazing surprise and feeling I could ever imagine to have.  It felt good knowing that my family cared that much for me.  I felt happy knowing that the surprise and shock on my face from how much love my family gave me, was a blessing.  It was like family reunited and came together.  I am so blessed to have an amazing family.",,3D3VGR7TA11ZZUE1GD0NNLYKAQC3RY
