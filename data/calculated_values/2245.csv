I relearned how to walk with my walker. I was in my wheelchair. I'm glad I can somewhat walk now. I hope I can job again one day. I remember jogging in a track team in high school. I was the best at it. I remember at a big race almost breaking my leg. I was on the final lap of the race. I stumbled on the side of the track. This costed me a few seconds but I didn't trip. I kept on running to the finish line. I got the gold medal and the whole team celebrated. We got pizza that night for my big win. I had a blast eating a ton of pizza after being constricted to a diet for the run.",,3D3VGR7TA11ZZUE1GD0NNLYKYDD3RX
