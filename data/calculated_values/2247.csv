They have not given it back to me  and in fact it spiraled down even worse.  I'm now seeking legal action against them. It's pure terror. I went back through my old pay stubs and realized they were underpaying me. They were underpaying me a lot for work I had done. So I'm really frustrated now. I just let it go really.  I moved on and went back to my old job. I think I may be making more at my old job now in face. And I'm also going back to school. After this tech program which ends in one year I'll get a good job. That's all I'm worried about now. Going to school and doing a good job. Completing it and getting a job. I'm excited about it.",3D4CH1LGEBFUP6U3HB7LFUNZPLR9GA,
