It was shocking because my work is up to par, I just think that maybe the supervisor is out to get me because oI had to call her out recently for trying to jack my bonus money. She was literally braindead and could not look at the screen shots I sent her regarding it. I was very upset about it and now I don't know what to do. All I can think to do is wait until they get back to me and pray that they will promote me back to where I was becuase I really cannot afford to be demoted like this. I need the money to pay bills and in a few months I don't know what I will do. Because I will not have the money. It's stressful. I'm not sure. It's going to be hard. If they don't promote me back  I wil have to get another job. It will be okay. I have hope. I have hope because I applied for another job. I just have to buy street tires. Because it is quite a drive there.",3D4CH1LGEBFUP6U3HB7LFUNZPLR9GA,
