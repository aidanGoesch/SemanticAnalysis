I've been struggling with heatlh issues that prevents me from becoming pregnant. I did receive treatments but almost none of them seem to work. I knew I would never stop trying because it's something that is dear to my life. I was able to finally get treatment from my doctors regarding a diagnosis. during my journey I had a endometriosis diagnosis that helped me out. I really thank my doctors for hearing me out and making it happen. I will never be able to forget and thank them for listening and treating my so well. with their assistance I was able to get good help. a few of my friends had recently had babies and I have been amazed seeing them. I really wish the best for them all and their heatlh. Thanks to my doctors that put me on to something that I could benefit from. I received fertility treatments and they are now my life and we hope to soon welcome our own little one. I am glad they were there for me during my journey and able to add to it. Overall I am escatic to be with child.,,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DVYPH
