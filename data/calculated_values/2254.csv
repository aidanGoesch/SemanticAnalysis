I reported the incident to my supervisor, but nothing was done about the situation, because the coworker is friends with the director of the company. The coworker has been with the company for around 20 years, and he has made comments like these before. In fact, there is documentation of the coworker having made racist and homophobic comments, in the past. Because I reported the incident, I have been targeted by my superiors. My evaluation was unfair and they have singled me out for ""guidance"", expecting me to perform better then every other employee. The coworker I complained about has been involved in a new incident. Another coworker asked him a question and he yelled while throwing his keys at the other coworker. The other coworker was hit in the chest by the keys. He filed a police report and the police officer wanted to investigate. when the incident was reported to the county attorney, she decided to do nothing. So, this coworker, who makes discriminatory comments and assaults people, gets away with everything. The rest of us are held to a different standard, especially me. I am currently trying to figure out the next step to take. This has created a hostile work environment and should not be tolerated.",,3D4CH1LGEBFUP6U3HB7LFUNZWWC9GO
