My husband was involved. The accident resulted in his inability to walk. This was a heavy blow to the family. He was the bread winner and the rock upon which the family stood. He was depressed by this. However, he was very determined to walk again. He started attending therapy. He got stronger every day. He took his meds. He woke up every morning, and did simple exercises. This made him stronger. He started being able to stand. And soon enough he was able to walk. The doctor gave the okay. This led to full recovery. We are happy.",,3D4CH1LGEBFUP6U3HB7LFUNZWXR9G5
