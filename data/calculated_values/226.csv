My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors.  I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.  I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world. I CAN'T WAIT!!",,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DVYPH
