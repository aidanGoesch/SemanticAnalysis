She had a really hard time with it at first and we were just shocked that it was taking her so long. She was not born early by any means but it seemed like she was developing at a slower pace than most babies. For the longest time she would just crawl on her belly and push herself with her legs instead of attempting to get on to her knees. I had been spending time with her trying to get her to get up on her knees at least because i had remembered my son would get on his and rock a little. I felt like it was normal and she should be doing this. so for the last few months when i would see her doing her belling crawling i would race over and try to put her on her knees and see if she would attempt to crawl or at least stay up for a period of time. so after weeks of this not working and seeing no progress i just gave up. i had decided that i would let her develop this skill on her own. Well a couple of weeks ago she decided that she was going to get on her knees and crawl all in the same day! i was playing with her in the living room and had to go to the other room to assist my oldest child with something. when i looked down at the ground near my feet there she was. she had decided that she didnt want to wait for me to get back and crawled to me instead. it was one of the happiest times because all of the worry and frustration had been worth it. i was so proud of her because i had just let her develop on her own and she crawled in her own time.,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO7A26UZ,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO7A26UZ
