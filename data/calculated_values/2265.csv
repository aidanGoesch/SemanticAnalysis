This happened about three weeks ago and was a very memorable event.  I was great to see my cousin so happy and to get together with so many friends and family members. It was an absolutely perfect day and everything went according to plan. I was one of the bridesmaid and my daughter was the flower girl. My cousin always said she would never get married, so this was a special event. The food was great, the dancing was fun and it just felt good to laugh and let our hair down. The thing I liked best about this wedding was that it was a stylish party, but it was also relaxed and comfortable. Guests were allowed to have a good time and party without being in a stuffy atmosphere. The party went on from early afternoon to the wee hours of the morning. It was an amazing time and an amazing memory.  I feel honored that I was asked to be a part of it. This was also the first time my daughter went to a wedding, so it was a memory for her too. She felt like a princess in her fancy dress. She had an amazing time. I hope to see everyone again soon.",3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO8RZU6J,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO8RZU6J
