I was staying with my parents after selling my house and my dad caught me drinking. They decided to kick me out and I went. I bounced around hotels and camped outside (it was still pretty cool, winter to spring in Texas). I was still drinking and I knew I had to quit but was (and am) very scared of withdrawals and DT's so I just kept on drinking. After camping out a few nights I noticed a pain in my right side when I tried to breathe deep. At first I didn't think anything was really wrong, maybe a cold. It got worse. It got harder and harder for me to breathe. I ended up calling my mom and asking if I could come stay with them because of this pain. She said yes, so I went back to my parent's house. The pain and breathing kept getting worse. So we decided it was time for the emergency room. We went and after an hour and an x-ray the doctor told me I had pneumonia. It was a surprise; I had never had it and had no idea it was this bad. I also told them I would be going into withdrawals and they admitted me right then. Got to the room and they gave me meds for DT's (librium) so that immediately helped. Then I got meds for the pneumonia plus the first of many breathing treatments. Then in the middle of the night a nurse came in and asked what level of pain I was in 1-10 and I said around a 6-7. She said well you're getting morphine and I was like, I never had that so lets see what happens. As soon as she plunged that drug into my IV I felt the best feeling ever. If I was in any pain after it I didn't feel it, just floating on a soft bed. I told her, 'wow, now I know why people get addicted to this.' She laughed and said yep. So I got that shot every six hours and it was nice.",3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXOF3K6UB,
