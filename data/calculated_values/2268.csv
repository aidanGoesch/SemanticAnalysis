I had been a drinker for most of my life but I had gotten worse over the last few years. I was staying with some family while staying dry but I slipped up and secretly started drinking again, which was actually no secret to the family I was staying with. I was kicked out, no where to go but my vehicle. No job. I had a little money for gas, most for alcohol because I didn't want to go through withdrawals. I started sleeping in my truck, the weather was cool and humid, worked out OK for a few days. After that, I started feeling rough: my chest hurt when I breathed and kept getting worse. Finally I had to go to the emergency room. They took me in, gave me tests, x-rayed my chest. I told them I was an alcoholic so they gave me medicine to hold off withdrawals. Turned out I had pneumonia. I had no idea pneumonia was that bad. They admitted me; private room, nice bed, fed me. And treated my pneumonia and alcoholism. Pneumonia sucks, it hurts. So they started giving me morphine, WOW! I had never had it before and it was great, didn't care if anything hurt. I stayed in the hospital nine nights and when they discharged me I wasn't quite healed unfortunately but I did finally heal up. I stopped drinking for a while but then I relapsed, doing OK now, dry for six months. And that's how I learned why heroin addicts had such a time quitting, morphine just lets you melt away and feel good, alcohol just lets you feel crappy.",3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXOF3K6UB,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXOF3K6UB
