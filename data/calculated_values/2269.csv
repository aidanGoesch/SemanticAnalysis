Boom!!! it goes. Happy birthday to you they all sang bringing the huge cake towards me. with a big grain on my face and that feeling of surprise, i hid my face and felt like going back out. just behind my was my beautiful wife who unknowingly to me rushed after me and had prepared all this just to surprise me at work. i was handed lots of gifts from co-workers and even patients who were on admission. what propelled me to go down in tears was when the cancer patients presented a lovely birthday song to me, it was so so amazing. my wife of cause gave me a warm heart felt kiss and a small box. with joy in my heart i quickly took it and opened it in the presence of everyone of cause they were all eager to see too what was is that beautiful small box. surprisingly to me, a pregnancy test strip was looking at me with two lines. i turned and looked at kayla who never told me she was pregnant with our first child. this was the happiest moment of my life. and i will never forget what a birthday it was.",,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXORH3U6M
