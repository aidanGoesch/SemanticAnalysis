It still feels unreal to be living with my boyfriend, but it happened. This is the first time I have been living away from home for such an extended amount of time. I am totally surprised though. After the challenges of getting me to move in here, I find that we actually work really well together. My boyfriend was so mad when I told him that I wasn't packed and ready to move in the day before I was to move in. I had to sit down and really make him understand that I was just nervous. I was definitely taking the move seriously. I just could not fathom leaving everything I knew and was used to for the unknown. It took some time, but we talked it out and now I've been here for a while. It was a big adjustment at first, but I am actually glad that I went through with the move. After a month of getting to know each other better, and seeing how we are during a variety of challenges I felt like our relationship has blossomed. My boyfriend must feel the same way. He had been acting suspicious for the last few days and finally on our date night this weekend I found out why! We went to a really expensive restaurant for dinner. And guess what? He popped the question! Yes, THE QUESTION! I'm so happy right now!",,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUII9TYPH
