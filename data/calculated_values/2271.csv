After all, we will see in the news what happened that night. I always remember what happened. For my part, I'm going to therapy. I go for long walks. I get distracted at work thinking about what happened. I see my family and I'm afraid it will happen the same. Although my family stays together and does not talk about it, I know they still remember it. My cousin should be the protagonist of that night I talk a lot with her. I still think about all the things we saw that night and that's why we stay together. and I still try not to think about it. to continue with our lives.",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV
