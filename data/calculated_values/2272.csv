We woke up early, around 6am to prepare and head out. The goal of the trip was to get some nice shots of the waterfront during the winter months. Dad agreed to teach me some of his photography skills. So we packed our bags with our hiking gear, as well as our photography equipment and a lot of food, since we planned to spend the whole day outside. It was freezing! Thank god I brought warming packets I could throw into my pockets. We started off the hike, leaving the car at the end of the road. It took us about an hour to get to the southern shore of Lake Superior where we planned to do our photo shoot. Along the hike, we got some nice close up pictures of the fallen snow on the trees, and a few shots of some deer. At the main photo site, Dad planned to take shots of the massive ice sheets along the lakes. He taught me how to take different shots with his wide lens and then how to get closer shots with his zoom. In the end, I think we got about 2000 or so photos during the hike. We got home very late that day. When we got home, we uploaded all the photos to Dad's computer. He then showed me how to photoshop and adjust the photos to really bring out their true beauty. It was a good day!",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV
