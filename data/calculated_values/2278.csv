We first met when we were in seventh grade art class together. We were twelve. Now we're in out twenties, college graduates and she's a mom. Getting to see her in her dress before the wedding, just the two of us, was a special moment. She looked beautiful and excited. She was nervous about the alterations and it was nice to be there for her. We had fun just spending time together, which we don't get to do as often as we used to. The most memorable moment was when I saw her in her dress for the first time. I'd gone wedding dress shopping with her, but I hadn't been with her when she found ""the one."" She looked amazing! Like what you dream about looking like on your wedding day. I really enjoy getting to share these moments with her. We're part of a close-knit group of friends who have known each other since middle school. Looking back, it's crazy and amazing to see all the ways we've grown up together. I'm glad I get to be with her during this important life step. Going to the wedding dress alteration was a very memorable experience.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU3WO5N6,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU3WO5N6
