I struggled in high school and didn't think i'd come this far. Everyone around me called me a class clown. They called me a low life loser. They said I'd go no where. The most hurtful point was when my parents gave up on me. I felt totally rejected and hurt. This gave me the tools to fight and keep going. I struggled through my reading and match. I begged for extra help. I struggled hard! I finally got through this and succeeded! I am so very proud of myself. I think I even make my parents proud of me. I'm ready for my next hurdle! With my talent, I can do it.",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRUC6ZN5S
