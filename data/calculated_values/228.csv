I had mostly lived with my parents my entire life, except for a short time in college. My boyfriend and I had been preparing to move for a few months, and waited for the call each month from the landlord who would tell us when an apartment became available. Finally, that call came in August that we could move into an open apartment in September. Each day leading up to the move, I'd either think about what I needed to pack or pack a few things in boxes. There wasn't much of an urgency until the day before. Things didn't seem real until moving day.  I woke up at 8 a.m. so I could meet the landlord at 9:30 a.m. It was extremely nerve-racking since the process was new to me. I arrived before my boyfriend and waited on the lobby couch. I spent the next ten minutes texting my friends and family.  My boyfriend finally entered the room and I was relieved. We began signing papers and getting all of that sorted out. We both were eager to finish that task so we could start the apartment walkthrough.  My first time walking into the apartment was surreal. I couldn't believe that I would be living with my boyfriend of two years and away from my parents. I looked around at the large space and still couldnâ€™t fathom that that was my new home. I waited for it to sink in. The  apartment had that ""new"" apartment smell of cleaning materials.  It was so empty at first, even with all the boxes and furniture. I'm still getting settled in. The only thing missing is my dog, who is still living with my family and I miss her dearly. I visit her a few times a week. We'll have her here with us as soon as we pay the very expensive pet deposit, and then I think things will feel more complete.",,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUII9TYPH
