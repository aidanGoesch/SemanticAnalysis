During those 4 years I made plenty of long-life friendships. My freshman year I was able to be a part of one of best Bands in the South. My Junior Year I got to join my favorite sorority. I got to make lifelong friendship and sisterhood from my sorority.  Goring up I struggled in Middle school all the way to Highschool and didn’t think that I wanted to go to college. I was diagnosed with ADD in Highschool cause i knew my attention wasn’t always there. I ended up doing great things my senior year in high school after being diagnosed my junior year. But I went for it and didn’t let anything hold me back from accomplishing my dreams. I was nervous when I started and scared but i graduated with a 3.0. This is a memorable moment for me because I completed college on time within 4 years with a degree in Psychology and a Minor in Human Service and the accomplishments that I’ve done throughout college. I always wanted to help people and children. My goal is to go back and get my master’s in social work. But the will be a while from now. My dreams came true and I have the best support system anyone could ever ask for.",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRUC6ZN5S
