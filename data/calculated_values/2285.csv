It was dark and raining. It was not a season, but it was a rain that day. I had to come back and had a car. I drove the car to the near signal. There on guy asked me for a lift. I was like, who the hell asks for a lift at 3 am. It was scary and I was scared. But, I wanted to help that guy. So, I asked her the address. It was on my way. So, I said to be with me. But, later he said he is not going that way. He acted weiredly. But, however, I manage to keep calm. But, when I reached home. I was very much relaxed and thought of conquring the world. I was afraid and was not able to sleep. Because that man was very much weird. However, Everything went well in the end.",,3DEL4X4EL77KCTX1EXZ52XGL8L7YXO
