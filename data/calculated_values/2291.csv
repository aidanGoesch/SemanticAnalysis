This prison was the set for the movie Shawshank Redemption. We had been preparing for this show for months, and we had also been playing gigs throughout the year leading up to this. The two stages were quite large. The main area could easily facilitate a crowd of twenty thousand people. Although I would like to saw that we played for the main crowd, only a portion of the audience was watching us (a still impressive crowd of about five thousand people). The weather was hot but bearable. I was grateful and blown away by the opportunity, having dreamed of playing a large festival for many years. We got our own dressing room area with catering and drinks. I was finally getting the rockstar treatment, a humorous testament to the years myself and my band mates have been putting in to get to this point. Many of our supportive friends and fans came out to watch us perform. Aside from the gig, we got to experience the tour of Shawshank. Most of the famous movie scenes were filmed on location in Mansfield. The whole weekend was a surreal experience that I will never forget. I'm glad I got to spend the time with my close friends and bandmates. It was an extremely rewarding experience, and I'm overjoyed that the sacrifices were worth it.",,3DEL4X4EL77KCTX1EXZ52XGLK9HXYL
