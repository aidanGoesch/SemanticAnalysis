I cannot believe I got in to this wreck and now I am out of luck. I have not been saving money and the debt just keeps piling up. I really have no idea how I am going to get out of this mess. The guy cut me off at the intersection but they blame me because i had faulty brakes. If I had a dash cam i would not be in so much trouble right now. The guy is even suing me for the accident when its not even my fault! I will talk to friends and family and hope they can help me out. I really do not want to be in this situation, I cant even afford a lawyer and pay the court fees. I will hope that the court sides with me and it gets dismissed. If not I have no idea how I will pay for everything. My daughter is a mess with all of this and worried we will be homeless. I worry about this to but thankfully I can bunk with my sister if need be. I am going to fight this until the very end, I will not let them win. If I lose I will file bankruptcy anyways so they lose in the end.",,3DEL4X4EL77KCTX1EXZ52XGLKBDYXM
