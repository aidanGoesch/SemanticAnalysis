This accident devestated me, and it caused me to lose a good paying job, and I'm being sued by the other driver.  I was behind the lady, and I tried my best to hit the brakes, but it just would not slow down in time.  I'm not sure why, honestly, but I had only had the vehicle for two weeks, and I had noticed that it took a little more pressing on the petal than it did with my old vehicle.  I had even gotten out of my vehicle to make sure she was okay.  She would not even roll her window down for me.  I was coming home from work, and it was a forty minute drve from there to home.  It was sunny out, and the traffic was terrible, as it always wsa there at that time of the day.  I was shaking and trying not to cry, and even ended up giving the officers insurance information to my old vehicle because I was so nervous.  Even thinking about it right now is making my chest and head hurt. The police were nice, and understanding, thank goodness.  My vehicle was completely totalled somehow, and it barely made a dent in hers.  I was shocked to she her go out on a stretcher, though she looked and acted fine.  I'm sure it had something to do with her idea on suing me.  I had to call my sister to come and get me, and endure my wife crying when I called and told her.  I can honestly say this was one of the worst days of my life.  It caused me to lose a great job, and now I'm job hunting for a place close by as I stress over courts and lawyers.",,3DEL4X4EL77KCTX1EXZ52XGLKBDYXM
