I asked my husband if he would take me there, and he couldn't have been happier. He took a week off from work and so we left a few days after my birthday. The road trip itself was amazing and I'll never forget driving through the desert at night. I'd never been to Vegas before so everything was so surprising as the bright lights emerged one by one, glittering in the dark desert landscape. Finally we arrived at the Las Vegas strip around 2am, and the mix of sleepiness and bedazzlement was like a fantasy. My senses were overwhelmed by the bright lights lining the streets as we drove to our hotel. I was so excited that I could barely sleep that night. The next day, we got up bright and early, had a great ""birthday celebration"" breakfast and started walking the strip. Though it was only March, it was already starting to get hot there so we found refuge in one of the hotels - I think it was the Mirage? - and what an amazing sight it was! There were statues everywhere, the ceiling was decorated and it had a huge mall that we strolled around in. Later on, we went and saw the famous Bellagio fountains and what a wonder they are, with light shows and music. I had heard about them many times but seeing them in person was a true wonder. I'm not a gambler at all, but even going through the casinos was fun and unusual and surprisingly I actually won $100 at my first game of poker.   We finished up our first day by going out to dinner at a casual mexican restaurant and strolled around the strip a little more that night. The ensuing days never found us lacking in things to do, whether it was the zoo, catching a show or just exploring the neighboring desert and hiking. What a fun and memorable time that I will never, ever forget.",,3DH6GAKTYZB9HOXGFFNQZIWWJFPYZW
