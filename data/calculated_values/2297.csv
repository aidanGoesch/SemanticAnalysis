To celebrate, I thought of a number of possible things to do.  I thought about having a party.  I thought about a small, intimate dinner with close friends.  But at the end of the day, I just thought I wanted to relax.  I went to the spa and felt extremely relaxed afterwards.  So in my mind, that was enough of a celebration for me -- I was able to have 'me' time and relax.  At the last minutes, my husband asked if I wanted to go to Las Vegas.  Of course I said yes!  My husband made the arrangements so I did not know where we would be staying.  When we arrived at the hotel, my husband took forever checking us into our room.  To my surprise, we stayed on a premier level of the hotel that had limited access.  The room was very spacious and had a really nice view of the Las Vegas strip.  Throughout our stay, we went to several restaurants that we had never been to before for dinner.  We usually do not spend a lot of money on dinner but since it was my birthday, we did something different.  Each restaurant was nice and I really enjoyed the food.  When I look back at this trip and my birthday, I don't think I would change anything about it!",3DH6GAKTYZB9HOXGFFNQZIWWJFPYZW,
