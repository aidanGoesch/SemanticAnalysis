I just had to go, I must go! Nothing will stop me from going on my birthday!  My birthday happened to fall on a Saturday this year which could not have been better timing.   I told my husband I want to go out on my birthday this year to the new Star Wars land!!!  I felt he had no choice but to take me, it's my birthday! Usually I do not go out for my birthday it is just too much hassle especially when it falls on a weekday. But this was absolutely perfect! I haven't been out for years on my birthday and not only is it on a weekend, but after waiting so long for this park to open I will finally get to go and on my birthday!  I told my husband this is what I wanted to do on my birthday this year and I didn't care if we did anything else or not on that day, because I just wanted to spend the whole day there anyhow.  On the day of my birthday I could hardly contain myself.  It was finally here!  My husband made all the arrangements and took me to the new and very much anticipated Star Wars land! Once inside the park I did not know where to go first! I wanted to do everything at once, see it all at once but thankfully my husband was reasonable and we came up with a plan and that we should first walk around the entire park and take everything in.Just walking around and looking at everything was breath taking. I was so happy to be here and with my husband who seemed to enjoy it as much as I was even though he's not a huge fan of Star Wars like I am. After an hour of walking around we decided we would stop somewhere to eat and I was very excited about this as well because I wondered what all the wonderful food choices would be.  Once we found a place that wasn't too crowded we went inside and sat down at a booth and only after I sat down did I realize just how tired I was.  I was just sitting there looking all around when I turn to look at my husband and he is holding out a small box on the table in front of me. He says, this is for you. Happy Birthday. In all the excitement I had forgotten it was my birthday, and reached over and took the box. I had no idea what this could be. I opened the box and see that it is a necklace that is a replica of Episode 8!!  Wow!!! I could not believe this! What a perfect day this was turning out to be and what a wonderful surprise this necklace was from my husband!",,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FL234G27
