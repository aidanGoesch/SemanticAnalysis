He got me these tickets as a birthday gift. Going to the concert was so much fun. I've been a big fan of these guys for the past 20 years and I had never got the chance to see them in concert before. We went to lunch before we left the house and got something quick to eat and then drove a few hours to get to the venue. Once we got there we got to go into a club members area and wait instead of having to sit outside. We got access to the merchandise before everyone else. We also had access to private bathrooms and snack bars so we didn't have to stand in line so long! Our seats were phenomenal and I'm so glad that I got to experience this in such a good space. Not only were there no people directly in front of us but there wasn't anyone on either side of us as well. I feel like, even though we weren't front and center, we had the best seats in the house. The show started with a small opener, and I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. After the show was over we stopped and got some coffee so we could make it home without being so sleepy. We ended up getting home super late and I had to get up early the next morning, but it was worth it and I'd do it all again.  I'm going to print some of my favorite pictures and frame them.",3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL412GB,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL412GB
