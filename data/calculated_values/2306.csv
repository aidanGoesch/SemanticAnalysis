It was a typical day, I got up around 6:30 am, stumbled into the shower and shaved while I showered.  I brushed my teeth and did other normal stuff.  Once dressed, I fixed a cup of coffee for the road and drove to work.  I did the usual things at work when it happened.  I ran into a old girlfriend that I hadn't seen in over 20 years.  It was at a convenience store.  At first I wasn't sure so I asked if he name was Cindy.  She immediately recognized me and said my name. We made the typical remarks and I asked he if she would like to get a coffee.  We ended up at a bar we used to frequent in college.  We sat and talked for a while, finally establishing that we were both single again via divorce.  She was seeing someone but didn't know if it was going to lead anywhere.  I was sort of in the same boat.  We agreed to keep in touch and exchanged phone numbers and email addresses.  That was about 3 weeks ago and we have talked 2-3 times since then.  I'm not sure where it's going but at a minimum, it was nice to see her.",3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL4I2GS,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL4I2GS
