I had to do it . After fighting with the town about they said I would be have to do it so I prepared all materials and got a friend to help me dig. It was a big project and was about 125 feet of area. I bought the pipes at  special store. I needed 10 foot hard plastic pipes about 3.5 inch diameter. Needed a friend with a van to get them.  Then We proceeded to dig down about two feet down thru all kinds of junk rocks roots etc. First part was from a central point that water went into and then the difficult part came  I had to go under a sidewalk. Thought this would be easy but was impossible till my 82 year old neighbor came over with two massive crowbar pipes and the three of us actually took out that piece of sidewalk  It was very hard and heavy. Then the last 70 feet was a straight run. The town had made a connection point for me so all I needed was to connect the two after much digging . The connection needed a special joint so it was off to the store. All the while had to put up tape and stakes to prevent people from going there It looked horrible. Now all connections were made and needed to concrete over the connection in the starting point which again my neighbor helped. He was great and knew how to do everything including pitch which was important so then we made some adjustments and finally filled in all the stuff. All this work by my 82 year old was surprising because he acted like he was 40. Not possible to accomplish this without him . Filled in the area with dirt and had a friend bring over new dirt to fill in some spots. Then the job was to spread grass seed and cover and wait for the grass to grow. Finally had to appear in court because the work was delayed util I could get help. I had to pay a fine for the violation of town ordinance in the first place. What a colossal and expensive pain in the ass. Had to pay the digging guy and owed my neighbor big favors too.  I would not want to do this again ever.,,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLQQ3G24
