I was outside with my daughter and she was playing with her friends and trying to learn how to ride a bike. I was looking at the next parking lot over and saw a few young kids riding their scooters and bikes on the side walk but going into the parking lot as well. I couldnt see anyone watching them and people zoom around here in all parking lots. I was paying attention to my daughter when i heard a loud thud. I knew instantly what it was. Some young kid in his supped up car smacked into of of the girls. I called 911 as i was running over the kid didnt even get out of the car. I stood behind him while talking to the operator in attempts to not let him leave. The kid was screaming, i think she broke her arm, and the mom finally makes her way outside. Shes with her kid screaming as im talking and waiting. The cops show up a few minutes later before the ambulance and take over.  It was crazy but the girl in the end ive seen in a cast. It could of went a lot worse. Im kind of glad we have nothing going on in this town because the police were there in minutes.",31T4R4OBOT2DUBQ50SDIB7BE48M7CF,31T4R4OBOT2DUBQ50SDIB7BE48M7CF
