I applied for my license. I got the exams in 2019. I am happy I got my license. I will be the best accountant in the state. I applied to many places. I got a lot of rejections but finally got a call back. It was for an old firm. I got the job immediately. I was treated like family at the place. The workers were very nice to me. The boss gave me cigars for my hiring. It was a nice hiring bonus. I made a lot of good calculations and save the company a lot of money. I hope to get promoted to top accountant at the place. That day will be the best day of my life.",,3DI28L7YXB0EGNVH73240LK4L4A1ER
