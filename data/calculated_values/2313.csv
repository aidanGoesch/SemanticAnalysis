I got my degree in accounting in 2010, and started working full time the next year.  However, I did not research into the license that many duped the gold standard of accounting until then. I wanted to have a good career, and I look into the advancement in the accounting field.  I pass all the exams in 2013, then it was time to proceed to get the license. It was then that the CPA experience verification process comes into play and I finally got my license about 5 months ago.  Since it was a long time since I pass my exams, before getting my CPA license five months ago, I have to go through the CPE, which is a 120 hours of continuing education where I brush up on my CPA materials.  I also have to do an interview, go through the experience verification, pass two ethic exams, as well as many other steps.   I was told CPA license would open many doors and make it even easier to advance in my career or in my own business, even though I already have two college degrees.  I was happy I finally able to finish the licensing process which took me about 5 years due to various reason since I was traveling oversea the past two years and for some reason, the process was taking a long time from the other sides as well.  I was happy as that license is considered gold standard of accounting, whatever that means. I think that in term of qualification and license, that is as high as I can do for accounting.  Though that license comes with many responsibility including having to continue with professional education, as well as register for my license every few years.  The CPA exam was one of the hardest exam I took in my life.  I actually have to study and prepare for it seriously and not just cruise through it.  the materials and what I need to know on the exams are considerable.  There was a lot of things to know and a lot of things to study about.",3DI28L7YXB0EGNVH73240LK4L4A1ER,3DI28L7YXB0EGNVH73240LK4L4A1ER
