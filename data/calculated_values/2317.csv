You can do everything right in life, and still not be rewarded. 11 weeks ago today the day My dad died. He was driving down for the weekend to celebrate my birthday when a drunk driver swerved into him. My dad's car rolled several times and he had to be airlifted to the hospital in the city. I remember sitting in the hospital on my birthday hoping he would wake up, that is the only present I wanted. I didnt feel like celebrating or doing gifts, I just wanted to see my dad. Unfortunately 10 days after the accident he passed away. I didn't know what to do or how to take it. I knew he was still heavily involved in the church and this brought me some soalce. I attended but didnt really know all the rules and stipulations of this church. Apparently one of the monarchs was in town and told me about the traditional funeral rites and about the special garments they wore. I asked if I could get these garments somewhere and he told me of a store downtown. As I shopped around I was filled with the grief from his sudden passing and knew this is the last thing I would buy my dad. I wanted to honor his beliefs so I bought the shawl and clothing. It was bittersweet saying goodbye, knowing there was nothing he could do to prevent what happened. I miss him and hope wherever he is now he is looking out for me.",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C1RLE8T
