It has been hard finding the time to dedicate because I am still working my full time job. I didn't realize a side business would be so much work. I have had a few jobs over the past few months but nothing big. And a lot of them were for family, so I didn't really get paid much. I have pretty much been breaking even after the cost of supplies and everything is deducted. I hadn't realized how many supplies I needed until I started making these cakes. This past weekend, however, I had my biggest side job yet. I was hired to do all of the baking for a wedding. I got the job through a friends coworker. I was really nervous, it was the biggest job I had ever even attempted to do. I planned for weeks in advance and had everything figured out. It really worked out perfectly. And more importantly, I made a lot of money! Even better than that though is that I got my name out there and I think I got a lot of exposure from this one big job. Since then I have booked almost 15 different jobs, all from people who tasted my cakes at the wedding. I honestly never thought it would happen, but it looks like my side business is finally gaining some traction. I hope if I keep doing well I will be able to quit my full time job eventually and bake full time. I am just so happy that my hard work is paying off!",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7CRGQE82
