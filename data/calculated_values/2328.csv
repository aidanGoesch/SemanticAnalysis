It was when I finally broke through the marketplace and succeeded in getting my business ventures off the ground. Even though this wasn't my main job and was a side business, it was still very significant to me personally. I've been researching over the last few years about how I can make extra money through some kind of online business. I have been trying very hard to do different things but it's been very difficult getting something to work. Many people who try these sorts of things give up and fail. However, it turns out that it's not something that I'm incredibly interested in doing and the money isn't that great. I've realized that it's not worth it working so hard for something like this, and it would need to make a ton of money in order for it to be worth it. Even so, it's good to know that this thing is there whenever I need it. It's always good to have a backup plan. Additionally, it's not certain that the business will be a good long term investment. Despite all of these setbacks, it's a great learning experience and it's given me much more confidence to really pursue great things. I realize that my side business should be related to my current job. That way making time for the business is also helping to make time for my career and further me along that. Overall I would say that this journey has been worth it so far.",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7CRGQE82
