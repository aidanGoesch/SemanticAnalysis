But won't get it. 1 month ago.... I have studied the engineering. After finishing my studies I can apply many Jobs interview. I made it pretty far in the interview process. To the  job I really wanted that. I have more abilities to show me The best person in the world. So i did many hard works. I have an interest in Scientific engineering. So I apply many job vacancies for the scientific engineering. One day morning I received a phone call when i took bath. My mother ask me to receive the call. when i came back to my room I attend the call. I was shocked and extremely happy. Because the call is from ""American Scientific Research Center"" . The interview is on 2nd December, it was arrival by the Government. On that day I have ready to the interview. I thought that the day was turning point of my life. But , I have never expect this. Because I have not get the job. So i feel bad. But i have a confident to  achieve my goal.",,3DL65MZB8E1Y3Q5FN0ROHH3V1E0ECV
