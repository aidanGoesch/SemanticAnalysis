She would have celebrated her 99th year on earth in 2019 had she survived and her 100th year in 2020.  My memories of her waiver.  I do remember spending nice times with her.  I accepted her position in my life as mom.  I even had goals, as a child, to make my parents proud of me and to make sure I was in a position to take care of them.  I had no idea that she never accepted the role of mom; that there was no real connection.  Why do I reach that conclusion?  Because no true parent would ever want to see their child suffer, or struggle.  No real parent would be absent from the important milestones in their child's life.  I did the things I thought would make them, including her, proud of me.  I wanted the love and admiration of parents just like any other living human being.  Why was I different?  Why was I passed over?  The months have passed by.  I will always have the memories; the good ones and the bad ones.  She was a part of both.  There was a time when I had hoped that we would talk again; that she would own her part.  But it never happened, and there are things I will never know.  There is sadness in my heart.  I hope she is at peace.",3DL65MZB8E1Y3Q5FN0ROHH3VP10CER,
