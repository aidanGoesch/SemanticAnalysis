When I was a young child I lived with this person, so it was jarring to me.  There had been a lot of ups and downs over the years and I wasn't a part of this person's life anymore.  But hearing about their passing still made me feel a certain kind of way.  The reason that it affected me is that this person had played the role as parent in my life at one time.   The situation was not a good one, and their passing made me think about the life as it was at the time.  This person had lived a very long life, so I wasn't sad about that.  They were ninety-eight.  Their birthday would have been the 25th of this month and they would have turned ninety-nine.  Although I wasn't in direct contact with this person, I was hoping that they would reach one hundred.  Again, they lived a long time.  Of all the brothers and sisters that there were (I knew nine of them, there had been fourteen), there are, as far as I know, three of them left.  She was the oldest of the last living siblings.  But anyway, the emotions I felt were subdued, but I think that I feel ok, because I know I tried my best during those times.  Life just doesn't always give you what you expect.",3DL65MZB8E1Y3Q5FN0ROHH3VP10CER,3DL65MZB8E1Y3Q5FN0ROHH3VP10CER
