He had saved up some money but he spent it on Christmas presents for his family and friends. He had been working part time for a warehouse near his house but it was closed for the season and he had been out of work for a few weeks. He had tried calling his CTE worker but he couldn't get a hold of them. He went to the bus station to get a ticket to go to where his sister lives, but the ticket was too expensive.  He had no family or friends in the immediate area, so he didn't know what to do. I had worked with him a little bit at the warehouse and he seemed like a nice enough person. I had given him a ride home from work a few times over the past few months. I gave him my phone number, so in case he needed a ride. He kept my number and gave me a call. he let me know what his situation was and that he was not sure what he should do. I told him I would drive down there to see him. When I got there he was just sitting on a bench in front of the station with his head hung low. I greeted him and he looked up at me. I asked what was going on and he said he had nowhere to go and no money so he was scared and worried that he would have to sleep out in the cold that night. I looked in my wallet and had ten dollars  in there, which I knew would get him a night at the local shelter a few miles away. I told him I could pay to get him into the shelter tonight. I told him I'd give him a ride down there so he wouldn't have to walk in the cold. He smiled and thanked me for my help. When we got to the shelter, I told him to give me a cll in the morning and I would see if I could find him some part-time work at the farm I worked on so he could try to get money for a bus ticket or somewhere more permanent to stay. He started crying and thanked me and gave me a big hug.",,3DL65MZB8E1Y3Q5FN0ROHH3VSMICEI
