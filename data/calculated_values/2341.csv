My boyfriend's mother went to the doctors to get a check up. After a few test they found that she would need some more advance testing. After a few advance test, the results come back and she is diagnosed with arterial blockages. She never would have guessed. She had no signs or symptoms of such a diagnoses. She's been going to this doctor for years, she trusted him completely. After speaking it over with the doctor for a solution to this problem he says a stent surgery would be necessary. She gathered us all around to tell us the news. We were hurt to say the least. We didn't want to lose her or anything bad to happen. We backed up her choice to listen to her doctor, we figured she knew best and this was her body. In the back of my head I felt she should have gotten a second opinion cause she had no symptoms for this, there was no sign of it, how did this doctor get this conclusion. But she reassured us that her doctor knew what he was talking about it and she was taking it from there. My boyfriend and I took her to the hospital that morning of the surgery. She was nervous, we were nervous. After, what seemed to feel like an eternity, just 3 hours, the doctor returns to us with news. He tells us she is now in recovery but he has bad news. It turns out she really didn't need the surgery. Her test came back and there was a mistake where her results got mixed up with someone else's. They started the surgery without more test, without a second opinion. We were in outrage, his mother is old she doesn't need unnecessary surgeries. We are seeking out a lawyer in this matter for medical fees.",,3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9F46A
