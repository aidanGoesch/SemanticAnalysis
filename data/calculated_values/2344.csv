The week started with final exams. I had 2 exams scheduled for each day and they counted for 50% of my final grade. So all the work I did all semester was not important, all that mattered was these tests. So I stayed up each night this week studying, stressing and preparing the best I could to take my final exams. By the third day, I was so exhausted getting out of bed, I think I blacked out. I ended up falling out of my bed and I don't even think I was conscious at this point. I fell right onto my arm and sustained a painful hematoma. My roommate came running in and couldn't believe what she saw. She urged me to go to the hospital. I tried to brush it off and go back to sleep but the pain was too much so I agreed to go to the hospital. I sat in the emergency room for 90 minutes before being seen by a doctor and they admitted me to the hospital right away. Apparently the injury wasn't urgent enough to get to me right away but was severe enough to admit me to the hospital. I saw many doctors and even a specialist. They preformed a multitude of tests from X-rays, blood work, and a CAT scan to make sure I didn't have any other injuries. The doctors told me that I would need surgery and I was devasted. Not only did I not want to undergo surgery, what about my exams? The pain and stress were so much to handle and I burst into tears. After discussing surgery and options with a few doctors, the attending physician decided it wasn't necessary and he could treat the injury without surgery.  I was relieved and was released from the hospital the next day, just in time to take my exams. Lucky for me, my professor was understanding and let me complete them during make up time frame so I had more time to study. I ended up doing well and had to keep my arm in a brace for my entire summer break.",,3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9M46H
