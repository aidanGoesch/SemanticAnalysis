I was so sad to let him go. He was quite old and had been trying to bury himself. I took him to the vet and the vet put him down. I cried a lot about it. It was a very difficult time. He had grown up with my boys and was such a good dog.  I still miss him even though 2 months have gone by. It's been hard to be without him. I have 2 other dogs and they still walk around looking for him too. He was the leader of the pack. I remember how he used to take the other dogs for a walk every morning. He would get them up and let them eat, then he would amble outside. When he got sick, I would look for him under the house. All he wanted was to lay down and be left alone. It was hard for all of us. I miss his stupid face. He was a good dog.",,3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92OULWPB
