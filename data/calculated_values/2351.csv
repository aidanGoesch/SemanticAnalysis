It was a tragic event, but I take solace in knowing that she passed away in my arms, someone who loved her dearly. My arms were around her, holding her close to me. I hope she felt safe and loved to her final moments. I spoke softly to her, telling her loving things, and telling her that it was okay for her to go. I kissed her head and stroked her body gently. I told her how much I loved her, how much I would miss her, and that I will see her again one day. I told her how good she was all of her life and that my other dog would be there waiting for her as she left this earth. Since the time that she has been gone, I have kept her memory alive. I have spoke about her often. I have pictures placed throughout my space. Her picture is my screen background and saver on my phone. I visit her and my other dog's grave every day. I speak to her letting her know I still miss her and love her. I think of her often and remember the things that she did. I remember her attitude, her disposition, and the things that she did.  I take comfort in knowing she is in a better place and not in anymore pain, but I still miss her greatly.",3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92OULWPB,
