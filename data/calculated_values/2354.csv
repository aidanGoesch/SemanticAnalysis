I was staying at my parents' house because my father was ill and in the hospital. My mother was spending nights at the hospital with him, and I would go during the day and spend all day there, staying alone at my parents' house at night. It was a stressful time. The night before my father was scheduled to come home, I woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains. I was terrified, and thought I was having a heart attack, and all alone. The pain subsided after about a minute, and I didn't know what to do, but I eventually decided just to go back to sleep. In the morning, though, I felt off, and after speaking to my mother and my husband about it on the phone, called an ambulance to go to the emergency room. I hurried to get dressed, but the ambulance was coming from less than a mile away, and they arrived while I still had my nightshirt on, over a pair of jeans. The EMTs came in, and there was a flurry of activity, with people taping electrodes to my chest, giving me baby aspirin to chew, and asking me a million questions. The next thing I knew, I was on a stretcher, being wheeled out to the ambulance that was out in the driveway. They took me to a different hospital than the one my father was in, which was inconvenient for many reasons. Once at the emergency room they taped more electrodes to my chest and hooked me up to a monitor. They drew some blood, and asked a million more questions. Then... they left me alone. My brother arrived, having been sent by my mother to come and sit with me. He was able to stay for a while, and we talked, and I waited. Eventually my brother had to leave, and the nurse came in and drew more blood, explaining that if I had had a heart attack there would be hormones in my blood that would be at certain levels for the first and second test. Eventually they told me I would need a stress test, and after more waiting, I was taken upstairs for that unpleasant ordeal. Then... I just waited. For hours. Eventually someone came in and told me that my test results indicated that I had not had a heart attack, and I was fine, and I could go home. No explanation was given for what had actually happened, which was shocking to me; I could not believe that they didn't have an answer or some kind of diagnosis, or even any kind of advice, the doctor just said there was nothing wrong, and that was it. All I got was a sheet of paper with reasons a person might experience chest pain. So, I called my sister-in-law to come and pick me up, and then waited in the waiting room, hungry, annoyed, confused, and wearing my Star Wars R2-D2 nightshirt over a pair of jeans.",3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92WKSWP6,
