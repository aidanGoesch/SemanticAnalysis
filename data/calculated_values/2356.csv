I don't know if this contributes to the fact that I also have autism. It is a pretty mild form but still trips me up in public where I get immense stage fright like symptoms even in a one on one situation. This led me to start working on my book ""The R Word"". The book is about my experience being a functioning autistic individual but trapped in my own mind and body when in social situations which makes me seem for lack of a better term, retarded. The book talks about overcoming these challenges and how I hope to grow and think I haven grown. After much deliberation I decided to leap off the edge and host a book launch in celebration of its release. I remember the day vividly, the sun was shining even though it was mid october in the pacific northwest. I wore my best shirt, and had about 4 dozen copies of my book. Many people came in and bought a copy and I was doing pretty well with engagement. I shook some hands and even hugged a few people that I hadnt seen in years. Overall Im proud of my accomplishments and hope my book serves to encourage people to push their own limits. There isnt anything I would change about me. Writing this book helped me to realize that. If you keep trying and keep pushing yourself, most anything seems possible.",,3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92X5MWP7
