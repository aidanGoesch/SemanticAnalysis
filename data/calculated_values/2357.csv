During this event, several friends and family members came to the book launch to purchase a copy of my story. The story is about a teenage girl who learns valuable life-lessons while babysitting a young boy with Downs syndrome. I spent much of this party with my book in my hands, hardly believing that this was something that I did. I could officially say that I was a published author. It really surprised me that family members and friends that I hadn't seen in years (some since high school) came to this book launch to support me and my dreams. Over 300 copies of my book sold in the first day that it was available. I could not believe that 300 people bought my book! It was a dream. During this book launch, I was able to spend time speaking with and signing books for all of my guests. I then took pictures with everyone so that I could remember these moments forever. I understand during this launch that it was a pure experience for me-- like a wedding or giving birth-- I would never ever have my very first book launch again in my life. I could continue to write forever but this would be the the first celebratory event. Needless to say, I live in a colder and rainy climate but on this day it was absolutely gorgeous. No sweatshirts or umbrellas were needed and it was just beautiful out. I think that in addition to having friends and family come from all over the US to purchase a signed copy and see me, there was another very big surprise. As someone who is a strong advocate for the overall safety for children, I set out a to raise money during this event for a company called Thorn. I was very surprised to learn that over $50 was donated to this jar in support of an agency who specifically saves children from trafficking and sexual exploitation. I cried when I counted this money jar and again when I wrote a personal check to Thorn.",,3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92X5MWP7
