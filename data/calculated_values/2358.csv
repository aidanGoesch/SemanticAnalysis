We usually chat a bit if there's time while I am helping him. I always feel better after he has been there. I think to myself, wish all the customers were as nice and kind , patient as he is. Well, out of the blue He complimented me on how pretty I am. Then he said it always makes his trip more enjoyable if I am working while he is there. He's an older gentleman, always been very respectful and decent. I in no way felt the compliment was insincere, as in flattery or a come on. he just doesn't act the type of person that would do those types of things. Well, it made my day! I thanked him. I always try to thank someone who gives me a compliment, the world would be a better place if more of us did that. I also felt like this man sees me as a person, not just a ""clerk"" at the store, but a human being. I know some people would feel uncomfortable if a customer told them they were pretty, but it was sincere. That's all I can say. It gave me a little boost for the rest of my day, I wish him good things in his life.",,3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZDDBET3
