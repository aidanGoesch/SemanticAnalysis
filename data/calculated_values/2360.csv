It was a long morning working at my part time retail job. We normally have more customers this time of year, but today it was going by slow. I wasn’t expecting to have any more customers. I had given up on any friendly faces coming my way into the men’s department that afternoon. But to my surprise a family came down the stairs and wanted to shop. I was polite and said hello greeting them and welcoming them to the store. It wasn’t long before we were laughing and talking about kids. One of the guys in the group commented on how young I looked for having 3 kids. To my surprise he also told me how beautiful I was. His family agreed and I blushed. To make it more awkward he then began telling his family how much he loved the store. I stood there trying not to be embarrassed while he explained how often he visited the store and how he enjoyed coming while I was working. It made my day. They left shortly after with their purchases and I ended my shift with a beat in my step and feeling like a million bucks.",3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZDDBET3,
