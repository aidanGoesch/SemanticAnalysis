I went an saw many things. The main thing I liked was the long walks through the historical areas. It seemed magical that night. It was very dark and the buildings old and detailed. The oddest thing happened though. It snowed. It was late spring and it was totally abnormal. Even the locals were amazed. It made the night even better and created great shots. I took so many pictures of the architecture and snow falling. It truly made everything better and more ornate. I liked the fact that is was unexpected. It added to the whole dynamic of the scene. I will be going back.,,3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZDETTE2
