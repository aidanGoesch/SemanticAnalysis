Things are going well in your relationship, you love and trust your partner, you feel safe and secure, and then suddenly you don't. Suddenly you get hit with feelings of inadequacy. You get hit with those insecure feelings like ""am I too fat?"" and other horrendous thoughts. My boyfriend cheated on me. It wasn't with anyone I knew. It wasn't with an old flame. It was seemingly random, with a woman that he met at the gym. I cannot believe him. I would never even think of cheating on him. Even now, after all the incredible pain he has caused, I would never cheat. I love him so dearly but I don't think I'll ever forgive him. I don't think I could ever. I just have to move on I guess. I'll have to just move on, and try to look past this.",,3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZDOATE3
