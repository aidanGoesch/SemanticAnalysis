My close friend had never betrayed me at all on any level. I didn't know what to do or how to handle this crazy development. I thought we were going to get married. We hung out all the time. I really didn't want to snoop in his phone. I didn't think it was possible. He tried to justify it when I finally confronted it. I wondered if I should just stay with him. He was a great person. I was surprised because I've never caught anyone cheating. I thought he would be the last one to do that. I decided that my friendship and relationship were never going to get better. I had to end it. I was so pissed off and I've never been so shocked in my life.,3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZDOATE3,
