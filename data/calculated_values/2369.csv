We have a sister who lives in Burnaby and she lives in an apartment along with her family.  It is our tradition to have a vacation together with our families.  It was a very memorable experience because I get to experience it with my siblings.  My sister's apartment's location is just 5 minutes away from the train station and mall.  It is just a 5-minute walk!  I was really impressed because her location is very near to everything that she needed.  I basically go to the mall everyday and I can buy food whenever I wanted.  If I needed some groceries, I will just bring my portable shopping cart and then I will just walk to the grocery stores.  If I wanted to go somewhere, I will just ride the train.  Everything I needed is there.  We also went to some of the tourist spots there including Victoria Island, Capilano Bridge and a lot more.  The Capilano Bridge is really scary because it is long and shaky if people walks really fast.  It was one of the happiest vacations of my life because I get to spend it with my loved ones.  Vancouver is really a beautiful city.",3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZEJOETT,
