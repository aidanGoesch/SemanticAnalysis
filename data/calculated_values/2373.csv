My wife and I drove down to visit her sister and her sister's husband since we hadn't seen their new house yet. We went down for the 4th of July, partied, talked, and had a great time. The most memorable night was the evening of the 4th of July. It started to rain hard in the afternoon and we had to cancel going to an event we were going to go to to see fireworks. However, this turned out to be great. We got to drink, party, and have a bunch of fun together at home visiting. I'm glad this happened because it allowed us to spend more time with each other. Events visiting family like this are my favorite because I just love connecting and spending time with people. It brings me a lot of joy to visit with family. Plus, once you have a little bit of drink in you it allows you to open up and talk more. I think we had a great time connecting and bonding with each other. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I hope that we get to spend time with them again soon. Maybe next time we can rent a beach house and go to the beach for a week or weekend. It's great to have family that you can talk with and bond with.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ350SVM
