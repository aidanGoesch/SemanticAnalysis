We told many stories with each other, and had so much fun eating the birthday cake. And the best part was when my friends gave me my gifts. I didn't really expect the gifts I got, and it was so nice to receive them. I opened them and I was surprised by some of the gifts I got, but they were so nice, and I liked them. After that, we played some games with each other, and talk some more about life. It was just such a great time. I had fun. I know my friends had fun too. It was just so great. And amazing. I can't wait for my next birthday. It's just so cool. I love it a lot. Best birthday ever.",3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ3S3SVZ,
