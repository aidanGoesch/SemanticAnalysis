To push the limits. I have always thought if i could make it better, become harder and stronger, do something worthwhile. I have no doubts now, right now. Yes, i can, because i did it today. I gave me a big challenge, and came out of it successful. I noticed that there was a marathon going on in the country side. It was a spur of the moment decision. I signed up. I was literally shaking, thinking it was the biggest mistake i had ever made. But i buckled up and started running. I realized my legs went numb as soon as i covered the elevated mile. I thought i was going to faint when i reached the mountain trails. But something in me gave me strength and i somehow recovered. I finished the race with hours to spare!! Yes, i can! And i will, hereon.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ5J1SVH
