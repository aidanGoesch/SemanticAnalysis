I entered a really hard race.  It is literally a marathon (26. 2 miles) with over a mile of elevation gain and over a mile of elevation descent on steep rugged mountain trails.  It goes over boulder fields too.  I trained really hard for it as I went out running 6 days a week and then lifted legs 2 times a week.  Going in, I was cautiously optimistic, but I was unsure because I had never done this distance before.  I took my time and was making good time.  I was easily beating the cutoff times by hours.  Not even halfway through, I started cramping, along with most everyone else.  Roughly halfway through, my leg went numb.  I couldn't move it any more and I was frozen in place.  I took some salt tablets and got moving again.  I paid better attention to my nutrition at the aid stations and kept going.  I didn't have any problems afterwards and I had a blast.  I completed the race many hours ahead of the final cutoff time and was proud of myself for doing that.",3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ5J1SVH,
