At the time we weren't married we were just boyfriend and girlfriend with a 4 year old son. We had some financial struggles here and there, but we always managed to stay afloat. Once upon a time we had to make a sacrifice from seeing each other were he took the night shift and I worked the day shift. It really took a toll on our relationship I thought it was going to be over. Then on my birthday I decided to go to Las Vegas for my birthday just to get away for the weekend. I had no idea what was coming my way. That weekend after we had dinner he asked if we could go over to the Bellagio hotel to see the waterfall. We went over to the waterfall he asked me did I love him and was I loyal to him and I said yes and then he kneeled and proposed to me. I was in disbelief that this was happening after everything we had been through I was overwhelmed with excitement I was going to be marring my best friend. It was a night to remember I think about it all the time. I plan on planning a trip back and staying at the hotel just to relive the moment. All I have is memories there that will last a lifetime. Can't wait to plan our wedding. It's going to be magical experience with all of our friends and family.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZCVCVSQ
