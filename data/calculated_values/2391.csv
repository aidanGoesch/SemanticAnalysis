We got off to a rough start when I first joined the team, but since he's come to terms and actually appreciate what I do. It start when he broke his pelvis. There was really no one around him for that week. Most of my coworkers were taking vacation at the time. He had no choice but to leave me with some of his duties. I was actually pretty eager to take the duties on. It gave me insight into what it was like to be in a managerial position. It started off pretty stressful. His boss, which was my boss now, set high expectations for the 3 weeks my manager was out. I ended up taking it though. I did actually pretty well and surprised myself. In the end, my manager came back. He saw that I was running things better than him. He decided to refer me to a promotion. I actually got it as well!",,3DY46V3X3Q4D8M37XPBDZHR8F5V55E
