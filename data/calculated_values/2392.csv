I was already nervous I was going to be overwhelmed and overloaded with work when I got back from being off for 2 weeks, and now this? I figured I could cope with the work and do my best to get by. This would also be a perfect opportunity to display my abilities and convince the higher ups that I deserve the raise I have been trying for for so long now. Well, lo and behold, 2 weeks after picking up all of these tasks, I got called into the boss' office for a meeting. It where then that I was told I was doing a great job. Because of my efforts, there was lag in business from my supervisor being out. I proved to the team that I was great at my job and a valuable asset to the team. I was given the raise I had been working for right then and there and I was ecstatic. Even though I got the raise, I am still going to work hard and constantly try to prove myself. My supervisor is still out to this day. I have not slipped at all in my work and my bosses are still impressed with what I am able to do. I feel like it might be time for me to start asking for another raise. If not another raise, at least a bonus. I really stepped up and filled the role of my supervisor and it has gone great. I;m just happy people are noticing the amount of effort I have been putting in.",3DY46V3X3Q4D8M37XPBDZHR8F5V55E,
