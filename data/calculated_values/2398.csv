It's a base understanding about the benefits of life and me being grateful for them. Also giving praises to The Most High (TMH) for allowing me to do so. Every God allows me to awake is another day to serve him. My days usually go by simple enough: wake eating/or drink sometimes both if money available or the want or need to is here. Studying the Bible and people, animals and the world around me is fascinating in itself. I study and apply God's laws through the faith of Jesus Christ: by overcoming my trials and tribulations, giving charity whether it be in the form of wisdom or materials, and working with others in various communities throughout the united states so far. Ok so waking up the first thing I do is show thanks to God. Next is some scripture reading, videos, or music. Next up is food. I've taken a so called ""vegan"" route recently so I focus on fruits vegetables, grains and foods from trees. Among drinks I have water (various types) along with fruit juices(natural are preferred). When it comes to milk I use almond, rice, oat, etc. Then finding some form of work. I am growing to understand that tradition work in most people minds that I've grown up with (9-5) is not the best form. So I am constantly looking ""work"" or the lifestyle where I get paid to do what I love. Most of it is teaching even if its online or not. It's always in the spectrum of making life more honorable even in the lowest situations or at least that's where I'm beginning at even though our history doesn't start from those ""cloths"" This journey is forever so growth is always expected even in the smallest area such as appearance changes, updating tech, and understanding people situations to guide them to overcome SIN and parts of their lives they don't like. Just those few actions are almost always a full day.",3DY4FPOOA2AJB3GK0N6T6GQ3REHRVT,3DY4FPOOA2AJB3GK0N6T6GQ3REHRVT
