We shared a common love of going to live music events and ended up really bonding over it. At times we would recreationally use pain killers together. After graduation I moved home and got a job in my field of study and stopped partying and using drugs recreationally as the opportunity wasn’t really there anymore and I had lost interest in it. Mikey, however, had continued to use and eventually his use progressed from pills to heroin. We slowly lost contact with eachother since I was busy with work and didn’t really live close by anymore and he always seemed to be busy. I detected a change in him as well. He seemed more shady and like he was hiding something. At this point I had no idea about how bad it a situation he was in. He began asking me and other friends to borrow money frequently. At first we all did what we could but eventually sentiment switched and he became ostracized in our group. This summer it had been a couple years since we really hung out or had any meaningful conversation. I had heard he had gone to rehab and every now and then we would exchange a few texts but the conversation never really progressed. I think he felt like he was no longer wanted by anyone he used to be friends with. A month ago he overdosed and died, alone, and everyone  is acting devastated. However, I feel like I, and others, should have been there for him to help him. His passing has left me feeling like I turned my back on a friend when they needed help the most   I’m not sure what I could have even done to help though.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG8HMQP3,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG8HMQP3
