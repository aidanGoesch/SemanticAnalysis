I was right about full movement but Im happy with what I got back. About 18 weeks ago my doctor said i was a candidate for a new procedure. This new technique restored 98% mobility in my ankle. There is only a 1 year recovery period and 1 month of no weight bearing probation. After that I have a bit of physical therapy and I should be good to go. It's crazy how fast life gets you down when your body fails. I am not 18 weeks in and feeling great. The journey has been long but so worth it. Not constantly being in pain is a big plus. I cant thank the doctors enough. My life is leaps and bounds above what I could expect. I really have a feeling of getting my life back on track. I love that i was able to participate and urge others to get this surgery. If you can take something to control your life do it. You will thank yourself for it.,,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2
