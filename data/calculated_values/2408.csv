One day I sprained my ankle while running and injured it pretty badly. Because I had no insurance at the time, I could not get it seen to by a doctor. Anyway, fast forward 4 decades (I'm 64 now) and have bone on bone arthritis in my right ankle joint. I was in a lot of pain daily and was having trouble walking any distance. So, in April of this year I, found a doctor who actually does ankle REPLACEMENT surgery. Now, prior to about 5 years ago, this was unheard of and the only thing available was a fusion of the ankle bone, which is probably why I did not have anything done earlier. The surgery is so new, that there are no predictions as to how long the joint will last, because there is no long term data yet. But, in April I took the plunge and had my right ankle replaced. Although the recovery is said to last up to a year (I'm 4 months in), I am walking without pain for the first time in years. I was unable to bear weight for one month and have had three months of physical therapy retraining my ankle to walk again. I still have a long way to go to recover my balance when walking and doing the kind of hiking and walking I love to do, but I feel it will all be worth it in the long run. When I have fully recovered, I should have 98% mobility in my ankle, which is a far cry from a fusion. I am very thankful I waited for the right time and technology to come along. It never ceases to amaze me when I think about the advancements in medical science that are happening so quickly. I'm just glad I have a new ankle, and my friends all call me the Bionic Woman.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2
