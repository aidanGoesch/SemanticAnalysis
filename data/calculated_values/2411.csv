It was my dad asking which immediate care I liked to use. I thought this was strange because my mom always handles stuff like that. I asked him what was wrong and he said nothing, but I could tell it was something. We hung up and went to my husband in the backyard, I told him that something was weird and I was worried. About 10 minutes later I got another phone call that my mom was in the hospital and my dad asked if I could come up to the hospital. I started to panic, kissed my husband and ran out the door. When I arrived at the hospital I found out that my mother was having a heart attack. I was scared but quickly found out that she was okay. That is when the anger set in. I was angry at my dad for not immediately telling me what was happening. I was angry with my mom for refusing the ambulance at immediate care and thinking they could drive to the hospital. I was angry at them both for not having the common sense to go to the hospital immediately instead of bothering with immediate care. After mom was admitted we found out that she would need a heart cath. She was trying to be brave and strong and kept saying she was fine and didn't need the heart cath, she was just under too much stress at work.  The next day she had her procedure and we found out she had a 99% blockage. I am still not happy with how the situation happened and I am not comfortable with the way she takes care of herself. I am nervous for the future and hope that this doesn't happen again.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGA6RQPO,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGA6RQPO
