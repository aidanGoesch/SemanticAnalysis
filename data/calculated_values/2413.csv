I have a husband, a daughter, and a son. They deserve to have everything that I had when I was a kid and more. I wanted to be able to move them to a safer city. We were living in Memphis and it is not a safe place. There is a lot of crime. There is a lot of criminals in general. I talked with my husband and we decided we needed to move slightly out of the city. I decided to start saving money for the move. I did everything I could to get extra money. I decided to sell my hot rod. It was a nice car but the money we could get for it would be enough to get us moved. I put up an ad for it and had people calling really soon. It only took about 2 day to sell it. I got all the money I needed for a down payment on a new house. Everything went smoothly and we got the new house just a month later. We are all much happier now.",,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGJ01PQU
