I was meeting with the new clients at the office and the suggested we go do something really different. I wanted to impress them so I pretended I was on board and said I'd try anything. White water rafting! That is what they suggested! I was terrified. I can't swim, and I am scared of boats. I felt like an idiot admitting those things, and I really needed to impress these clients, so I agreed. I acted excited. I was so scared I couldn't even breathe. When we got to the river it became obvious that I had no idea what I was doing. I couldn't put the safety gear on without help. I felt a lot better that at least everyone knew I was a fraud, but that didn't get me out of participating. They insisted I follow through. I could have refused, but then they wouldn't have wanted to work with me anymore I was afraid. The entire day was amazing. I have never been so scared but so alive in my entire life. I can't say I've gone rafting again since then, but I still remember that day fondly. And the best part? I closed the deal! So I made some friends and made some money off of the entire experience.",,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN
