We went to Watertown which is in Upstate NY with a bunch of people that live at the halfway house that I work. We all rode together in a few cars and the van and had a lot of fun just getting there. When we arrived it was quite beautiful, it was raining but that did not stop the fun. We seperated into groups of 6 or 7 and went down the river with a river guide. We made a couple stops to swim and do waves with the boat. It just proved to everyone that it was possible to have fun in sobriety. It was an unforgettable day for all involved. I do have a vivid memory of people flying out of the boat and seeing them pulled back in. It was the entire staff from the mens and womens houses so although it was a work trip - it was the same as being out with a group of close friends. It was something I had always wanted to experience but it would have been hard for me to afford. Just seeing all the guys together having fun and being able to participate is a memory that will stick with me. I now have checked something off my bucket list. Being in nature is always something that I enjoy and this activity was so much fun. I think back on this as something that is once in a lifetime.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,
