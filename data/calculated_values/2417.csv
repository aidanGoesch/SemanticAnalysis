Around three months or so ago I talked with my supervisor about possibly advancing through the ranks. I mean, I've been with the company about two years now and it's somewhat strange working with people fresh out of college. Anyway, he was totally on board with that and hinted at an opening in management that would make me a team supervisor, but it wasn't really up to him (it's the coordinator's job to pick and choose promotions). So I shrugged and tried to win the part. I came in early every day, helped answer questions from the new people in the office, and even took on that extra project from the finance department. Of course, three months later that opening gets taken by some new hire. I was feeling pretty dejected but apparently the coordinator took notice of my efforts and actually gave me a small raise. That was a nice incentive, and plus I can add some finance related stuff and other employable skills to my resume. I guess all in all I'm not even sure if I would have liked the management position anyways, and it's got me wondering if maybe I should take what experience I have from this position and move on. The pay is good, about decent for a data scientist, but I'd really enjoy taking on some more long term projects or having a leadership position. Working here was invaluable as someone new to the industry and trying to learn the ropes, but if there's no hope of working my way through the ranks, then it's probably best if I part ways. I'm a little stung about the promotion, but honestly I'm not upset about it anymore. The raise was at least something, and I'm thinking with the experience I got from the finance project that I can look into a job at a bank corporation that reached out to me. It would be a smaller office and more tight knit environment, which I think I'd prefer more. Still, I wonder if I should just hold out and wait to see if I can perhaps grab another position onboard management. It's a lot to consider, but I'm sure it will all work out.",,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGOQPU
