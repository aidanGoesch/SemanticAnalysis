I am in complete disbelief.. I am frankly shaking right now as i write this. I was on my way to office as usual. I did not realize how unusual this day was going to be. I was waiting at the signal, when i heard this loud honking. A car was closing in on our road from the opposite direction. We were on a one way, so i knew right away something was wrong. He was fast. And reckless. He drove into our road as other vehicles were coming in from behind. He drove past me in a second and jammed into a truck waiting at a short distance behind my car. I was terrified. It could have been me. He could have hit my car. I can't believe what i just escaped.",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GD2W3SO
