It was so emotional as I saw other people get hurt and this took place in May. I was directly involved in the car crash because I was in one of the cars on the day it happened. In my life I had never been involved in such an accident but on that very day I was shocked it actually happened.  such an emotional day, saw people crying, bleeding and other screaming. It marks a significant day in my life because I may have been dead now. may is significant to me. It is the birth month of my son and also my mother. It happened on that very day in May, it was a morning. I had just finished eating and decided to go on a trip, I had no clue it was going to end that way. As time went on, it became clear that I was out on Earth for a purpose and there is a positive force watching over me. I could not stop thinking about it for a few weeks. Its difficult when you see people screaming but you can't do anything to save the situation. Many times its fate and other times its just luck. It was a memorable experience and it makes me happy about life. Accidents happen all the time but this was a significant one in my life",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GD2W3SO
