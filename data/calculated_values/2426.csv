One of them was someone my husband really does not like at all. These were coworkers as well as friends, and my husband used to work at the same place I work at, so he knows them well. That's how he knows this specific person and how he gained this antipathy for him. Anyway, my husband claimed that this man only invited me out for a drink to ""get back"" at him or like, prove that he's capable of getting me to do things, sway me in a certain way, or whatever. This made me really mad because it's like he's saying people can't just enjoy my company, they would only invite me if they had ulterior motives. Also, it wasn't just one person, it was a group of people! So it's not like I was just having one drinks with one guy, which I would never do because I am loyal to my husband. Furthermore, my husband is not normally jealous and he does trust me, so this just threw me entirely for a loop. He wasn't accusing me of doing anything shady, he was accusing me of being naive, which bothered me a lot anyway because I'm not a naive person. I just think he has a huge blind spot where this dude is concerned. So this fight erupted because I could not see his side at all, and he on the other hand was being a macho macho man and would not back down because it's like he has to stake his territory. We went back and forth for awhile and honestly didn't apologize for a solid day. Normally if we have an argument it gets hashed out quickly. Neither of us get into prolonged fights. This one was a doozy and it took a day to work out.",3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKFW3SL,
