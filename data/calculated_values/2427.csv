He changed jobs, but I stayed, so he knows my coworkers very well. That's why he knows how much he dislikes one coworker in particular. The problem is I'm friends with this coworker. We'll call him Ryan, which is not his real name. After work one day, Ryan invited me to go have drinks with himself and three other coworkers (two male, one female.) I went and had drinks and a lot of fun. I did not anticipate my husband would be mad. He seemed to think it was disloyal of me to have drinks with someone he clashed with so badly in the past. He thinks Ryan only invited me to prove that I would go have drinks with him and not because Ryan just enjoys me company as a platonic friend. This turned into a fairly big dustup between my husband and I, and we never really fight! So I was surprised that it got to be so heated. He was offended that I would ""betray"" him, even though nothing romantic AT ALL HAPPENED, not even a little. Meanwhile, I was offended that he thinks someone wouldn't just enjoy my company in general and would only invite me somewhere to prove a point. Plus, I was in a group of friends, not one on one! To me it seemed like no big deal. I struggled to see his point of view. I did not want to apologize for something that didn't seem wrong to me. And my husband ended up apologizing, but then when I didn't apologize also, he got mad again and retracted his apology. It was just a huge thing that got out of hand and eventually he apologized for real and permanently.",3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKFW3SL,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKFW3SL
