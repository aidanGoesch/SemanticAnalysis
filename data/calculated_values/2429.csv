To cap off my last entry, my cat had died. Now two of my cats have been run over. So now, I have double the trauma I had in the first part of this study. I could not believe it; I lost one cat to the streets and then had another loss in the same place on the same street.  How this happened is my babies did not come when I called them, knowing they are cats this is a common thing not to show when your daddy calls, And like a dad I knew something was wrong.  I went out to the street and where I found “Star” the first one at 5am and found my boy ran over. The second one “ZooZoo” was at 7am in the morning, almost in the same spot.  I was devastated. I had four cats to start with and now I have one left. The situation I am in prevents me form keeping them inside and I really do not want to hold them like that. Chained to a chair or some object in the house. I had another boy cat that I got from the same church area and this was in 2010. He was an exceptional cat in that he was more like a dog than a cat. He died in my arms at the vet’s office of a common thing that happens to boy cats; he got a breach in his outlet area. We spent a lot trying to save him. It was too much for me and him to go thru and I had to let him go, he died in my arms at 9pm on a Saturday night. This event or altercation of my life is not and is not ever a good experience.",3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKGAS3Q,
