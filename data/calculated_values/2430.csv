I got my kitty food ready and they were ready to eat to..now 5:30am and one is missing. I called to him ""Mickey, Mickey"" to no avail. I had a bad feeling that something was wrong. I feed the other two and then went for coffee at the local Burger place..I then seen my baby in the middle of the street, ran over. My heart dropped and I began to fear the worst. It was him, my boy ran over in the middle of the street..he was just a baby. I scooped him up in my arms, bloody and carried him back to my house. This is something that I feel deeply concerned about, I have two more and they are outside cats and I really can't do anything about it. Yet. Ok I have to keep writing I see. I have all the characters and not enough lines it seems. This is a very odd test. I think the squares should be in the middle so I can see them better and or in a larger view platform. I really have no more to write about and nothing comes to mind except that the pain of writing this as I could not think of anything else more relevant at this time.",3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKGAS3Q,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GKGAS3Q
