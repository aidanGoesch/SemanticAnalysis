I keep having to be reminded of that the hard way.  Most recently was about three months ago. Instead of going to get my pickup truck registration renewed on time or, heaven forbid, early, I dawdled around until the last minute and then managed to FORGET the deadline entirely! End result: my sad truck failed to pass the required emissions test. No big deal, right? Not unless I want to drive the truck anywhere. So now I found myself scrambling trying to find some kind of ""fix this mess"" workaround all the while mentally kicking myself for being such a slacker in the first place. After about 50 phones calls to every friend and FOF (friend of friend) in very high (and a few low) places, I learned quite a lot about emission testing. For starters, new catalytic converters are crazy expensive. Second, you can hack almost anything with the right know-how and equipment ( which almost always includes aluminum foil). It pays to have friends who know stuff. They don't go out of their way to tell you but if you fail, you get one do-over, for FREE! Provided you can find a repair shop that offers one. That involves looking for a teeny-tiny official-looking sticker in the corner of an often very dirty window. So once you find this mechanical get-out-of jail-free card, you still have to pass the test. That's where friends who know stuff come in. The same three things kept coming up:  tires, oil, cold air. That's the ingredients to the motoring magic elixir: Make sure you have your tires at the proper pressure: make sure you have fresh, clean oil: go when they first open so your car is warm and the air temperature is cooler. The hotter the day, the more chance of coughing out some of the bad stuff. Armed with my new oil and freshly-fluffed tires, I was waiting at the bay door when the service center opened for the day. Fifteen easy-peasy minutes later I was motoring on my way to the license bureau with my A-plus grade emission sticker in hand.  The surly, scowling DMV wizards stamped my registration paperwork and now I can legally and safely travel the highways and byways for two more years before I have to go through this process all over again.  Mischief mangled, er, managed.",,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWERH1IP
