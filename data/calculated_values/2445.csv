The dreaded Check Engine Light was lit on the dash which meant the truck wouldn't pass fuel emission testing which was required for vehicle registration, it had been lit for a while but tended to go off for a while before coming back on for a while which was why I had never had a mechanic look at it.  I had received a notice to renew my registration well a head of time and could have done it then as the dash light was off at the time, but I procrastinated and when I finally decided to get around to it the dash light was lit again.  With less then a week left till the deadline the dash light went off again and I decided then to get the registration renewed, and I thought using my vehicle diagnostic computer I got from Autozone to clear the error log on the truck's computer would make sure the dash light wouldn't come on again.  So I was stunned that during vehicle testing when they plugged their computer into my truck's computer that the test failed, apparently my clearing the error log had cleared all data and if there's not enough data in the vehicle's computer it fails the test.  They asked if I had disconnected the battery for any reason and I just went with that, I was too stunned and miffed to tell them anything different, and the advise they gave me was that a highway drive of about an hour would be enough for the truck's computer to gain enough data for the test.  They also advised me that if the dash light came on to not bother bringing back for retesting.  So with just a couple days left till the deadline I spent my Saturday on a roadtrip, and the dash light came on.  I was frustrated, even a bit panicky thinking what it was going to take to get this truck to pass emissions so I could renew it, and kicking myself for the procrastinated that caused me to miss the earlier chances to get the renewal done.  Again I pulled out the diagnostic computer but this time to see the actual error code, then spent time on the internet researching.  I felt a fair amount of hope when I found the problem was well known and had a solution.  Vast majority of the time replacing the EGR valve solved the issue, many just cleaned their old one and managed to cure the problem without having to buy the part.  Didn't have time to try the cleaning method due again to my procrastinating, so off to the parts store to spend money on a new part.  Luck finally seemed to be going my way, found a place that had the part for much less then everyone else, and just as I was going to the store that damn dash light went shut off again.  With the new part in my truck passed the emissions test, online I got the renewal done with just two or three days to spare, and I haven't seen that dash light on since.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWERH1IP,
