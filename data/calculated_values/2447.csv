Upon arrival at the trail head the weather was perfect and we set off gear in tow. Now I like to be overly prepared and have high aspirations when I do anything, so we had too much gear for the both of us and wanted to go much farther then we actually did. After the first 3 hours of of hiking we were spent. However I had originally wanted to get another 5 miles before camping. Along the way we crossed paths with group of people and they had suggested veering off trial to visit a waterfall. Adn it turns out we weren't that far. So we decided to drop our bags and scout it out. While off trail we witnessed one of the neatest things, a doe giving birth. At first we heard some strange sound, I never heard a deer holler but this one certainly was making some kind of noise. As we got a bit closer we spotted her lying down making some kind of racket. We thought it must be injured. Deer usually have ticks and fleas so we decided it best to leave it alone. and continue on to the waterfall. Once we spotted the waterfall we were underwhelmed to say the least. More like babbling brook and less like the idyllic waterfall flowing into a mountain pond. so we decided to head back to the gear. As we headed back we saw the same doe, this time wandering around thrashing and acting erratically we thought must really be injured. however it was just a distraction, moments later we saw the cutest tiny little deer stumble out of the bushes. The doe and baby deer set off less than a minute later. We think we saw its first steps, and in under a minute it was gracefully prancing and darting off. Anyway the rest of the trip went smoothly, campfire and moonlight. Love and affection. And lastly on the drive home I got pulled over for speeding. All in all a great Valentines day",,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEII1I
