I knew then i was going to have a Valentines baby! when i first found out the estimated delivery date, i really didn't mind being a couple days past my due date. I wouldn't imagine anyone would want to be in the hospital giving birth on that holiday, however.. my boyfriend and i had the best Valentines Day we could have imagined. He helped me walk up and down the halls to quicken the process, which i loved because it reminded me of his support, as we were walking the halls, the nurses at the nurses station were listening to the radio, it was almost serendipitous that our favorite song came on, and how fitting it was for the situation. (stand by me, by: Ben E. King).  Then, after we finished walking up and down the halls, we got an all inclusive hospital meal! ha ha! dinner for two! i believe it was a pot roast with mashed potatoes, carrots, apple sauce and some sparkling juice, with our plastic champagne glasses. :)  Finally, the whirlpool tub is ""technically"" only meant for the mother to help soothe her while her body contracts. once the nurses left the room we both got in the whirlpool! ha ha! it was a nice, relaxing, and intimate time. My boyfriend was such an awesome support, and it really made me realize the abundance of love we have for each other, we made and anxious time so memorable and stress free. Of course the best time was welcoming our brand new baby boy into the world. I've never seen my boyfriend so vulnerable, i could tell in that instant he fell in love like never before.",,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEII1I
