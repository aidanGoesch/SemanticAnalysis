Will never forget the day. The weather was muggy and high 80's and I was driving to lunch when I received a call from my sister. The very last thing anyone wants to hear after they say hello is crying and unintelligible words, but that's what I heard. After what seemed like forever I was able to understand my 64yr old father had unexpectedly passed. My world was immediately thrown into pure chaos followed by emotions bouncing from denial to anger, all while I was speeding to make it the 15 miles to my parents. When I pulled in to the mobile park where they lived I was greeted with the red and blue flashing lights of 4 cop cars, ambulance, and a fire truck. My denial was gone. While all of us were shocked we were standing there for this reason our attention quickly shifted to our mom as she was struggling a lot. My mom had been with my dad since she was a teenager. They began dating in high school and were together for 40+ yrs. When I considered my mom was with my dad for most of her life I really felt bad for her. As my parents were poor and this was unexpected the ensuing days were very trying. How does one sell a trailer, get money for a funeral, find were mom wants to live, and grieve? Only way I got through was putting my head down and taking one step forward at a time. By working together and shaking any tree's we could find my siblings and I were able to obtain the funds for the funeral. In addition a couple weeks after the funeral we did find a buyer for my parents trailer. And lastly we decided mom's primary residence would be with one of my sisters. But, with the ability to also stay with me or my other sister when she wanted. Now the long road to healing begins.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEKI1K,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEKI1K
