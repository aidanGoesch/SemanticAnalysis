I spent most of time at home taking care of my little brother while everyone was out playing and having fun. My parents weren’t around too much and wasn’t until 10 months ago when I turned  when I finally allowed to legally move out and take custody of my little brother. My “teens” ended  months ago but I cannot really refer to those years as my teens since I had to live like a man. I had to learn everything there is to know about raising a family. I did have the occasional help or visit from my parents, but they were mostly out and about getting high on prescription medication. They may have cared for us in a financial sense to some extent, but our emotional relationship was completely absent. Becoming a man at such a young is not something I wish on anyone. It took a lot of mental fortitude to get where I am today, and I feel like my life going forward is going to be hindered because of that. I still think back on those years with absent parents and feel kind of empty about it. I’m not mad at them, I kind of nothing them. I’m going to do my best to ensure that my brother has a better upbringing than I did. It’ll be tough to have the money to get by, but I have a decent enough job to support us. I've had this same job at the restaurant since I was maybe 15. Luckily they know me and my situation well enough, so I always have something to eat.",,3E1QT0TDFQV87SHO271A0A54SX6I89
