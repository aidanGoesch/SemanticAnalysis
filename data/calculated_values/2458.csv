It was probably the most difficult question for me to ask him in the 18 years we have been married.  After much soul searching, I just couldn't be in this relationship anymore.  So we asked his mom to take our children for the evening and sat down.  I explained my side to him, about how we just didn't seem in sync anymore.  You see, we had tried therapy in the past, and we both attempted to compromise in the beginning, but would go back to our old habits after just a week or two.  My husband's interests have deviated from mine.  We didn't seem to have anything in common anymore.  I would try to talk to him about my day, what I wanted to do in the future, and I grew to realize he just wasn't listening.  That's when I had to dig deep and admit that I wasn't listening to him either.  I spent many nights awake, sad about my relationship and he just didn't seem to notice.  So when we talked that night, he agreed with me.  We worked out a plan on how to separate, how to tell the kids, and go about our lives.  We've been doing this for four months now and I think things are finally starting to settle.  I miss him, the familiarness of our routine, but my unknown possibilities of the future excite me.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ1LUGNV
