I now have the distinct pleasure of calling that surprise my wife, and even all this time later I can hardly believe it happened. I was walking through the park in historic downtown, a place I often go to gather my thoughts. Writers block had been plaguing me for days and I thought a bit of fresh air might do me good. I got so much more than I bargained for that day, much more than fresh air. Aubrey is a breath of fresh air to me today as much as she was that day. Anyway, that day I was lost in thought. I rounded the corner without looking or even realizing how far I had walked and bumped into the most alluring woman I'd ever seen. She had red hair and the greenest eyes my eyes have ever met. I had just bumped into her, even causing her to lose what I know now was a very expensive coffee, yet she smiled. My apology was met with laughter and so began the best adventure of my life. We got to know each other over coffee, of course I had to replace hers since it was my fault she lost it, and conversation. We talked about literature, music, and ideal travel destinations. We talked about school and the past and the future. We talked about everything and I swear we were in love by the end of that long conversation. Love finds you in the most surprising places.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ2FCGN2
