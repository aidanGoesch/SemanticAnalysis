That was a special night because we were two people who really had no business being around each other. She was an accountant, I was aspiring designer for graphics who was currently struggling to actually find work. We just so happened to be in the same place and ran into each other where a conversation was sparked. The first time we met I realized how beautiful she was. How amazing she was a person even knowing what I did for a job and seeing how sparingly at the time my work was coming in, she still gave me the time of day and respected me and I was very happy about that personally. So I was more than willing to just conversate with her. We sat down and I offered to buy her something to eat and drink and she was more than happy to do that. We talked even more and we couldn't get enough of each other at that point. Looking in her eyes I knew that I didn't want that night to end. I wanted to keep that and I wanted to make sure I knew what I was doing, at times I was nervous but I knew that over-time I would be more comfortable. So we kept talking and talking and you know the old saying that when you're having fun time flies by. Eventually we realized that after eating we literally sat and talked for a whole hour afterwards. I apologized for holding her time but she was telling me right away that she enjoyed her time. We exchanged numbers and a few months later we ended up dating. I was very pleased with how everything turned out and what I'm trying to say is that you never know where love or a friendship is hiding, it could literally be in plain sight.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ2FCGN2
