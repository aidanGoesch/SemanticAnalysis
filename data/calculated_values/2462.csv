I couldn’t get out of bed, just unable to move.  I knew it was getting later and later, but I still couldn’t move to get out of bed.  The kids woke me up telling me they missed the bus and they were going to be late, I had to take them to school.  I rushed around trying to get everyone dressed and ready for school.  The kids were dressed and ready, but I had trouble finding my keys.  All I wanted to do was cry, my whole body was aching, I had a headache and started to cry uncontrollably I felt completely out of control.  I was able to get everyone  to school, and I sat in the parking lot unable to stop crying, I felt useless and helpless.  I had to call Jim to pick me up because I was unable to drive home, I was terrified I would smash the car into a wall.  He told me he wanted me to get help, we can’t go on this way.  He made an appointment with our doctor, he was sympathetic when I told him what happened.  He referred me to a councilor, she is good.  We are working through my depression, with the therapy and my medication I feel a little better.  I know I have a long road ahead, but with the love and support of my family and councilor I have hope to recover.  I never want to scare my family like that again.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJD5XGNE
