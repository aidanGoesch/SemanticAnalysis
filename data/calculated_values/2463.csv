All summer I felt like a new woman. I was eating healthier, doing lots of fun things and feeling more like myself than I had in two years. My husband and closest friends noticed a change in me, so I knew it was real. Then suddenly, about 2 or 3 weeks ago, I had a really bad day. More awful than bad. I was sobbing and felt absolutely miserable. I told my husband I didn't want to be me anymore. I didn't want to be a wife or a mom, I wanted to be alone or dead. I've had quite a few scary days since that one breaking point and i realize now that I'm still not in the clear. I have good days, but i know that i can't fight this on my own. I have to find help. It's hard enough to talk to my family and friends about all the irrational feelings I'm having. I can't imagine talking to a complete stranger about how hurt and alone I feel inside. I know that I have way more support than a check of a lot of other people with this disorder but it truly makes you feel alone.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJD5XGNE
