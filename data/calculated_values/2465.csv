I was in a hospital and doctor said that my wife was having complications in it due to the back surgery that she had 1 and half years back. The surgery was not a major one but it is resulting in a complication for the child to come. It might affect the health of my wife or the child. Then doctor came in and ask for whom I need to save. He said that he can only save one, either my child or my wife. I choose to save my wife because she was the first that I think I should save. That day was a worst day of my life because I have to kills one life to save the other.  I was very much upset and for the next one month we were only talking casually and we never had a nice interaction or relationship. That month was also the saddest month of my life. My wife was saved but we were not living properly for that particular month but that we had a discussion and tried to forgot that event that happened in our life. We are now happy and had forgotten the past but sometimes it comes in our mind. This is because the event was recent and I think I would take time for us to forgot completely such event in our life. However, we have taken steps to do so. Hoping for well in our future life.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJT4ZGNU
