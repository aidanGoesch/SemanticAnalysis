Knowing how to say goodbye, and dealing with the sense of loss that can follow, is part of being a parent. The pain of separation can go far beyond simply missing your son or daughter after they're gone. Some parents feel a very real sense of grief and loss; a lack of purpose or control. Because having a child leave home to go to university is regarded as a measure of success – a sign that you have prepared them for the world – the downsides are often not adequately acknowledged. Parents are told dismissively to buck up, get a hobby or a cat and start seeing friends more – but ""empty nest syndrome"" can hard to cope with. A myth that surrounds empty nest syndrome is that it is only applicable to stay-at-home mothers, who have shaped their life around the nurturing of their children. In reality, it can affect any kind of parent, whether you have a separate career or not. Lillian Little says: ""I thought I would never suffer from empty nest syndrome – I'm a college professor with a PhD – I thought only pathetic women with no life beyond their kids had no problem with this."" But Little was afflicted by a sense of ""life-altering loss"".Having a job outside of the house can provide structure and distraction, but by no means immunisation. Family Lives found that so many parents experience pain at an empty nest that they set up a specific advice line for the problem. Making a plan for the initial goodbye gives a framework and can be comforting. It's worth sorting out the practical aspects in advance. Are you going to drop them off in their new home, or are they getting there by themselves? How will you travel, where will you park, what public transport will you use? And once you're there, how long are you going to stay for? Resolving these issues well ahead of time means that on the day itself all the technical issues are sorted, and you ""only"" have the emotional aspect to cope with.",,31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDSY9I5V
