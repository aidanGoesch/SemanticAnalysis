I had retired from my professional career two years ago.  I have been working part time in my field.  However, it was just during the time that school was in session.  I asked her to go to motivate her.  I wanted to help her re-enter after a significant illness and recovery.  To my surprise, an employer who I was dreaming about wanting to get on with was at the job fair.  I walked up to the table and told the representative that I was not qualified for the jobs they had posted.  She in fact told me that I did indeed qualify.  They would pay for my school to get me certified in the field.  That would allow me to qualify for the top pay level.  I promptly made an interview appointment.  I interviewed for the position the following week.  They called me this past week to submit to pre-employment screening requirements and if I pass, will receive a job offer in a career field I never thought I would qualify for!  Good things are going to continue to happen in the coming weeks when I finally receive the job offer and go back to work and school.",,3E47SOBEYRIAJV71JJHF2W1NHU7IC6
