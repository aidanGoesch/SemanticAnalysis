Our musical tastes weren't particularly varied and mature back then, but regardless, we loved listening to the same things whenever we would drive to Maine. One of the CDs we loved was from a tape that our Grandmother had made for us (she has since passed). It had all kinds of songs relating to Disney World, including songs from the various rides and attractions that were around in the 70's and 80's, mostly. We'd be in the backseat, singing along and smiling. This past July, I was dealing with a particularly profound case of depression. Life circumstances were not going well, and I was fighting to stay out of the hospital. I felt nothing could cheer me up, and it was hard for me to be fully participatory in life. Everything felt like a huge cloud of of heavy smog around me. Although we chat on social media most days, this was the first time I'd seen my brother in two years since he moved halfway around the world. He brought his partner of five years with him when he traveled back to the US to visit the family. One of the things we all did -- my parents, my brother, his partner, and myself -- was take a trip up to Maine. On the way back from Maine, my brother found music from that ""Disney Tape"" on Spotify and played it through the car speakers. I felt so light and happy. I was almost to the point of tears, from this weird cathartic sense of relief. For those few hours on the road, all seemed to be well.",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7E9KIK2B
