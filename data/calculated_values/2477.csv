The trip was after a particularly bad event happened. I wasn't in the best mental state at first. When I had been gone for several weeks though, I met someone while hiking. This person ended up knowing my grandmother which surprised us both. We talked for a while and had an enjoyable time. I went on with my trip and when I got back, I called them to chat. We talked for several hours and to put a long story short we ended up getting engaged. So this random person I never met just happens to know someone I do and then we just hit it off. I never expected that to happen. My life completely changed. I wasn't down anymore. I finally had something to live for. I am exited for what ever comes next. Life is good again.",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7E9KJ2KU
