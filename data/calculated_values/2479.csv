It's the toughest thing I've ever had to overcome and deal with in life. I always saw my grandmother in my life. I didn't see it any other way. When that happen, I had to gather strength within like I never have before. That was almost 7 years ago, but it's still challenging to get through overall. I fell into deep depression. And I wasn't even aware of it. That was very eye opening to be honest. But I pulled through and got over it. It was also shocking that some family members weren't there. All that mattered to me was my immediate family. I was able to take it one day at a time. I wish I could go back into time with my grand mom.  But God had other plans for her.",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7E9KM2KX
