It was a strangely cool evening for Aussie weather. Or so we're told, we'd only been their during our American summer but it was cool and we had jackets on. We had left our hotel to go get dinner in the evening and wanted to see if we could find a place doing Aussie BBQ. Shrimp on the barbie and all of that! We found a really nice restaurant in the center of the city. We ordered some drinks and then got a few plates of steaks and some lamb. The meat was really good. After we finished up we paid the bill and headed out to find our hotel. It was dark and everything looked completely different. We needed WiFi to contact anyone because we didn't have service for our mobile plan here in Australia. So I followed my mom and after maybe an hour we realized we were lost. Mom decided it would be a great idea to backtrack from the restaurant but we couldn't find it. Eventually we got back to the restaurant, it was around 11PM and they were closed. So she tried to remember all the specific little things we had seen on the way when a stranger came over who seemed to recognize her. He knew my mom's name, Sue, and so we thought it must be someone we knew. So we followed him and even though we were clueless about where we were we eventually thought we were on track. Strange as it may sound we really did think we were going the right way. Suddenly, we arrive at some kind of party, it's 12:30 and this guy introduces us to his friends who he expects we know, but we don't and they don't know us. Suddenly we realize we've followed some stranger who we don't know at all who thinks he knows us! It was hilarious. We laughed for about 10 minutes because we explained we were staying in a nearby hotel. One of the friends offered us a ride back and we took the offer and eventually made it to our hotel, tired as can be at about 1AM but thankful for the funny story to tell!",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7ESLZ2KV
