I just couldn't get my groove on there. So after doing a bunch of hits, I quit for a while. Then one day, in my email, I saw that I received a qualification for a batch of hits. The batch was going to be indefinite. As in, it would just keep coming. I went to go see the batch and it was really easy. I enjoyed the work and I was finally making good money on there. As it was going to be going on forever, I quit my other sources of income and focused primarily on mturk. I did other hits here and there, but really my focus was to just keep doing this batch. I was making around 80 dollars a day. I started to buy more things, and I was paying off a lot of bills finally. Suddenly, I received another email. The email said my qualification was taken away. I was shocked devastated. I almost couldn't believe it was happening. I was so careful. I emailed the requester asking what I did wrong. I was going to beg them for a second chance.  They messaged me back saying that it was a mistake and that I had received the qualification back. I was so relieved. It made me realize though, I could lose it all at any minute. But I guess that's no different from any other job these days.",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7EXXXK24
