I had saved up for a couple of years because we wanted to install a pool in our backyard for our daughter to enjoy. My wife and I thought that it would be nice to have a pool at our house for her to enjoy and so that she could have friends over. We have a neighborhood pool which is nice and could fill our needs but we thought our daughter would really having one at home. It took the pool company also 2 months to finish the pool. It seemed to rain so much during the time they were building it and ended up delaying us by several weeks. Finally they were alost done and it raied for 4 straight days. Our daughter could barely contain herself. Once they were finally finished, and we wrote the final check, we hosted a pool party for all of our daughter's friends from preschool. It was great to see her so excited and happy with the pool. We've been swimming each norning before I go to work. She has improved so much and I think she has the potential to be a breat swimmer. It's also been great for my fitness as well. I'm happy with the pool and think we made a good decision and the eyars of saving will pay off with even more years of enjoyment of the pool. Who knows, Emily may even get a scholarship for swimming and we will actually make money on the pool. I hope that she enjoys swimming and sticks with it.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2BA79DT
