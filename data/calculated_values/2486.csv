My daughter just turned 4 last year so I was happy to take her swimming. It isn't a huge pool, it's about 15ft by 30in deep, but I was really surprised at how she reacted. She is more aware than she used to be, so she had more fun than last year. At first, it was just liek last year. She can't swim, or go under water, just walk around with her head above the surface, but this year she asked me to teach her how to swim, so I did.  She learned to go under very fast, and it took about 3 days for her to learn how to go under water and hold her breath. I was very impressed with the way and speed that she learned to do this. After she learned how to go under, she then started doing crazy things, like jumping under, and trying to do somersaults, and back flips under water. This took a week for her to do those, but still, it made me very proud of her. We still have some summer left, and all during summer she's had fun. Also, those few weeks ago, I got her a giant unicorn for her to float on that she used a lot when she went into the pool. She climbs up it and jumps into the pool like a diving board.  As I dad, I couldn't ask more because it made our relationship closer. And to have my child ask me to teach her to do something and tell me she loves me, is the best feeling in the world.  I am very proud of what my daughter has accomplished and all the things she has listen to. I know she will keep making me happy and I will keep seeing her grow as she gets older.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2BA79DT
