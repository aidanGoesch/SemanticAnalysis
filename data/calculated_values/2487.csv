It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.  I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall. I told the staff to watch out he may be using in the bathroom.  It turned out to be true and he overdosed.  After about 30 minutes of waiting for him to emerge, they finally called the police.  He was out in the bathroom stall but still breathing.  I actually know the guy kinda which is weird well I have seen him a few times.  They were able to bring him back to life.  He was taken to treatment hopefully he sticks with it but it is very doubtful.  It is one of the problems with liberal cities.  They totally allow people to use drugs anywhere and sometimes even help them inject in some cities.  In every bathroom in portland there is a used needle trash can.  I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.  I hope that guy is ok and figures things out but that is doubtful he will be dead in a year at the rate he is going.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2BA7D9X
