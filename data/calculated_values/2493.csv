I had recently lost my father.  we'd had a difficult relationship, but we had been working on it, so in recent weeks, we had been spending a lot of time together and really enjoying it. He had gone for being someone I dreaded spending time with to someone whose company I loved and looked forward to. I was devastated when he passed. I was working at a job I hated. The environment was toxic, and it did not even pay well. I wanted to leave, but the hours were so long and irregular it made looking for a new position difficult. Worst of all, I was lonely. I was single, and felt like nobody cared about me. Of course, it was my schedule and impecunious state that made it hard to socialize, but my brain translated that to me being boring and unloveable. The one companion I had, and one of the joys in my life was my dog, Buster. He was always happy to hang out with me, and greeted me when I came home from work. He was always enthusiastic to see me. So, one day, I came home and found a package on my porch. It was from a friend in the city where I attended college. I thought she had forgotten me, as I though all my friends had. I opened the package, and it was a little faux sheepskin person, shaped like a gingerbread man. It squeaked when I squeezed it, There was also a card telling me how much she missed me, and saying the toy was for Buster. I gave it to him, and he loved it immediately. It's nowe his favorite plaything. I was so grateful for this kindness, and it inspired me to get in touch with some other old pals. Guess what? They don't hate me after all!",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2DOS9D8
