I had recently gotten back together with my ex from a while ago. We have been together for a couple of months now. Usually on my birthday I go out with friends. We might go to a bar or club and then call it a night. This year he said that he will make a special night for me. We went to a restaurant downtown where he made a reservation. I had never been to a restaurant where I had to make a reservation before. The food was great. We got to have many different dishes that I hadn't had before.  I had a blueberry martini which is my favorite and the waiter brought me a creme brule with a candle in it. My boyfriend quietly sang me happy birthday in my ear and then we left. We then went and saw a live band at a bar that we go to quite often. They were really great. We spent the night in a hotel and it was great to wake up to answer and I have to do anything for anyone else. It was the perfect day.,,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2KYG9DN
