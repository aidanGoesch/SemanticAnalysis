She was such an amazing dog.  I still can't believe that she went from that shut down feral street dog to the fluffy cuddly diva that she became.  She had no reason to trust us but she did anyways.  I still remember that moment when she rolled over for her first ever belly rub.  Today Elsa had a grand mal seizure and afterwards she was clearly in a lot of pain.  Her foster mom called me since I am one of her trusted people and I rushed over.  What really made an impression on me was how many people did the same thing.  8 other people drove over an hour to come help Elsa & her foster.  Elsa didn't just change my life or her fosters life.  She changed the life of a whole group of people who couldn't be more different from each other.  It's pretty amazing to think that a dog can do that.  All of us together made the decision that it was time to free Elsa from her pain and take her to the vet to be let go.  All of us crammed into a tiny room that was filled with so much love.  Sure there were tears but there was also laughter and reminiscing.  It really felt like we were a family in that moment.  One dirty street dog helped me find a family that I didn't know I had.  Thank you Elsa.  You will live on in our hearts forever.,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2KYGD9R,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2KYGD9R
