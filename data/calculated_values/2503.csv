You see my daughter was born with a CHD called Tetraology of Fallot. It is a heart condition where there is 4 problems with the heart. The doctor warned us that it would be sooner than later where her lips would turn blue. but one night when she was sleeping, her top lip turned blue. My SO work me up and we took her to the doctor in the morning. It turned out that her pulmonary valve was resctricting the blood flow to her lungs. so we ended up going to the hospital having her admitted.  and she had her open her surgery within the next 2 days (July 12th).. It was super scary not knowing the outcome. they fixed her heart within 4 hours but she will need another open heart when she is 11 or 12 years old. We go to the cardiologist every 2 weeks to check the function of her heart. we also go to the her regular pediatrician. She is also on Lasizl (dont know the correct spelling). it is a water medicine because she developed chyle after the surgery. (it is fat tissue that surrounds the heart) and is on a special type of formula for it. It is a tiring but it is the life of a mother. thank god her older sister helps me most of the time.",3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNA9DX,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNA9DX
