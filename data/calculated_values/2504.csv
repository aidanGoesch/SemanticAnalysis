I chose these two fields to be a valuable member of society.  I never really realized how much these things would impact my mental well-being.   You know, I thought I would be worried about my buddies dying, or having trouble stomaching a situation with a small child in a dangerous situation.  When I am IN these situations, I am in total control - I power thru everything I have been trained.  My execution is nearly flawless.  The real trouble sets in when I am at home relaxing.  The images flashback in my mind over and over.  I sweat, tremble, and sometimes, I feel as if I can't breathe or move.   About 5 months ago, the department made me see a shrink.  It has been determined that I have PTSD.  I felt like I had been hit by a Mack truck.  Until the shrink felt that I had mastered some coping mechanisms and showed some progress, they put me on Admin Leave.  All my buddies treated me like I was a bomb ready to explode at any moment - it was humiliating and frustrating.  As a matter of fact, even now, I don't keep up with many of them.  My wife and I separated - she was pregnant with our first child at the time - it was gut-wrenching.  As pissed off and non-trusting as I felt, I finally came to realize that my psychiatrist knew what he was doing.  He really made all the chaos and fear in my life make sense to me, and taught me how to compartmentalize things and truly deal with them when the time was right.  Once I learned how to do that, everything fell into place for me.  No longer did I stuff down my feelings and pretend I was some macho tough guy who wasn;t allowed to have emotions like fear, sympathy, and compassion.   In the last month, my wife and our newborn have come home, and we are stronger than ever, I am back on active duty and work, and there have been minimal incidents with the PTSD effecting me so strongly.  While the PTSD really nailed me at the onset, I have walked on and learned to be a better human to myself and the others around me.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNB9DY
