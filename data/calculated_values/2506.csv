It was a surprise diagnosis given to me after I had finally opened up about my trauma. Holding it in was hard, but getting this diagnosis was a lot harder for me. I'm decently young so I was confused as to how someone my age could get such a serious disorder. I didn't know you could have PTSD from things other than wars and such, so getting the diagnosis confused me a lot. I had to and am still in ongoing treatment for it, but at the beginning it was really tough. Going through the trauma with my therapist was exhausting and still is. Every day since then I've struggled with reality and how I view or trust the world and others. On that day I knew I had to take it slow and trust the process. Though things weren't looking too bright, I'm really glad I didn't give up. I wanted to give up more than anything but I wouldn't allow myself to. I knew there was more out there for me, so even though it hurt I pushed through. It taught me a lot though, as a positive. I've learned so many new helpful and healthy skills to deal with my emotions, as well as I've got an amazing support group. That day was one of the hardest I'd ever gone through, but also one of the most freeing.",3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNB9DY,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNB9DY
