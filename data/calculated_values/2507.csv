Our taste met each other and we were together for four months. Because of some problems between us we broke up 2 months ago. I told these all incidents to my best friend. He worried for the broke up. And then I told him that I was pursuing a new girl as a girl friend. Then he shocked because of my intention. And as I told my thought to my best friend I broke both hearts my ex girl friend's and my best friend's. And then I met the new girl. After having some conversation  I came to know that she didn't like me. I don't want any one to compel to like me. My friend realized that I am not good. And even my ex girl friend knew that I am pursuing a new girl. So she left me. And finally my best friend and my ex girl friend left me.,,3EA3QWIZ4JHR5C9C55C5R61RHT6ITQ
