I lost my cats to a living situation. One remained at a shelter. She was later adopted. The other was given to a friend. Today I still don’t know what became of the one was adopted. The other is in a happy home with a friend. Oh Christmas night she posted a video of home. He looks fat and happy as ever. It’s bitter sweet . I miss them gravely. I’m also happy that they are in good hands with a family that will love , shelter , and but it’s them. Like I stated earlier I really think I’m done with animals. I can’t deal with the heartbreak anymore . I will still love them. But only from afar. I hope I ceobvyed my feelings . This was hard  very hard.",31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBIR0XT76,
