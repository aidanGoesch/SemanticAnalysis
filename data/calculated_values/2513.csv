The entire day was pretty terrible. I woke up at 6:30 am when my alarm went off. I looked at my cell phone like I always do. There were 5 missed calls and around 20 text messages waiting for me. Everyone had been trying to reach me, but I guess I fell asleep with the ringer on silent. I read my messages first, the first one said ""Aunt Janet died last night"". I didn't even think, I immediately threw on clothes and sprinted down the stairs. I ran up to my mother and held her. She was hysterical, she had lost her best friend. She tried to talk about what had happened but I couldn't understand anything she said. I just hugged her for a while. After a few minutes we just sat in silence. I started to remember all the great experiences I had with my aunt when I was a child. I was so emotional and so upset for my family. We lost a great person that day. I don't think I will ever forget finding out that my Aunt died.",3EA3QWIZ4JHR5C9C55C5R61RYM8TI6,3EA3QWIZ4JHR5C9C55C5R61RYM8TI6
