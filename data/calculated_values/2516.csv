It was incredibly unexpected and surprising for me and my family. He had only went into the hospital about two weeks prior. Two days prior to his death, he went to a rehab facility and they even expected him to be able to go home in about a week. Everyone thought he was going to be okay, but he suddenly took a turn for the worst. He was a heavy drinker, but no one saw his sudden death coming. I was a bit upset and it caused me a significant amount of stress because my parents and I are his only family. We are the ones left to sort everything out and pay for the minimal funeral expenses. He didnâ€™t have a will. He didn't have many assets and certainly no cash to help us with the costs. All he had was us and a share of my grandmother's house. I am still so stressed from cleaning up the mess of a sudden death. I haven't had a break or time to relax in weeks. I don't even think I've had time to cope. I hope we've handled everything well.",3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWINY1JI,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWINY1JI
