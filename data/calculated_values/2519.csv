We live in South Florida. Her other three children live in other states and have taken an ""out of sight, out of mind"" approach to her care. They are content to let it all fall on to my shoulders.Mother has always been a little self-centered and melodramatic (though she thinks she is utterly selfless). Taking care of her was always a challenge but things got much worse when her ""cognitive decline"" became undeniable. She was diagnosed with dementia and the neurologist told me I could not take care of her all by myself and maintain my own health. (I was in my late 50s; I'm 60 now.) None of the other children thought this was any of their concern.The biggest daily struggle concerned mom' s anxiety medication. She was prescribed 3 pills per day ""as needed."" She thought ""as needed"" meant whenever she wanted and that ""3"" was a suggestion for other people, not a rule binding on her. A few times she took too many pills and ran out before the end of the month. She simply lost count of how much she had taken. So I ""took control"" of her medicine. She hated this and hated me for doing it. She threatened to call the police, to call distant relatives and tell them I was abusing her, and to call an ambulance because she was on the verge of a stroke. This was a miserable period for both of us.Not knowing what else to do, I called Adult Protective Services to see what they thought. A case worker agreed ""placement"" was right for mom, that  could definitely not take care of her all by myself in her current state. (Again, none of the siblings thought this concerned them.)Mom refused to discuss placement. She spent time in the hospital twice for minor things before finally falling and breaking her shoulder. This was the last straw. The hospital stay (her third in five months) lead to rehab and from rehab she went to assisted living. She hated it and hated me for taking her there, but it was the best thing for her. And, to be honest, for me too: there were more than a few times I feared I had dementia too! This was the greatest stress of my adult life.",,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWQC5J1T
