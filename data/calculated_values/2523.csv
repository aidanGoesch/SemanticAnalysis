We had planned lots of fun things to do. We bought theater tickets, were going to attend a picnic, watch fireworks and spend a day at the lake. The first morning she was at our house she laid in bed until about noon. My husband decided it was time to have a talk with her about responsibility. She spends a lot of time at our home because her home situation is less than desirable. We spend a lot of money trying to give her things and experiences that her parents don't provide. We attend her school events, buy her school clothes and dresses for school dances, buy her food, drive her where she needs to go, take her to look at colleges and take her on vacation with us. My husband tried to explain to her that he would always be there for her, even if her parents are not, but it is a two way street. We had been talking about buying her a car and helping her get her driver's license. He meant well with his talk, but his tone of voice intimidated her and she ended up locking herself in the bathroom and crying. It took hours for her to come out. When she did, she called a friend to come pick her up. She left and I haven't heard from her since. She deleted me from her social media. It was very hurtful because I have invested a lot into the relationship and also because she is family.",,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWTXW1JB
