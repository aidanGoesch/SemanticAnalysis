I knew that going in and thought I was prepared but boy was I wrong. My little guy came out and wreaked havoc on my life for a bit. I couldn't sleep, i barely ate and was always tired. It seemed endless and like it was going on forever. But that all changed about 2 months ago. I heard my baby boy laugh. that laugh put so much joy in my heart. I was walking on clouds at that point. I started to cry thinking about all the nice things that will happen in the future. I am ready to watch my son grow and continue to laugh. It wont be easy but I am prepared. I can do anything as long as I provide for him. He is my everything and I couldnt ask for a more precious boy. My life is complete when he is around.",,3EFE17QCRDRQUHLDANPUHP4Q51GSHJ
