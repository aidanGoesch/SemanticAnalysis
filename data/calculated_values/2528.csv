Fast forward a few years later and we now had 4 boys.  Ages from 9 to age 1. And 2 to 3 years apart.  We started discussing our family planning options before our youngest turned 1.  It was a shock to find out I was already pregnant with our 5th child.  Although I wanted nature to take it's course and decide what we were having I prayed for a girl.  I told myself that if we were pregnant with a boy it would be fine, that at least I knew what to expect.  Things would be easier having another boy. But secretly I wanted a girl. It was exactly three months ago that I found out I was to have a daughter.  Becoming pregnant for the 5th time was a shock.  My husband and I agreed we were finished after our 4 boys.  I was scared, apprehensive even about having a fifth child, but when I saw her on the sonogram I knew it was a girl and my eyes welled up with tears of joy.  It was one of the happiest moments in my life.  I am so glad that my daughter will have four brothers to look out for her.  I am extremely excited and cannot wait to meet her.",,3EFE17QCRDRQUHLDANPUHP4Q51HSHK
