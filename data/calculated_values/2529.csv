I can't believe how clumsy I am.  I was taking things out of my basement this morning, so I could sort through them upstairs in my spare time.  Well, I was pulling on a trophy that was in one of the boxes, when the thing let loose and I hit myself in the eye with it.   There was blood everywhere and it did kind of scare me so I called my sister up and asked her if she could take me to the hospital, she said she would.  We waited at emergency for 4 hours.  I had developed a bad headache and went to lay down in the vehicle.  I finally got called in and the doctor said, go home and I would be fine. He gave me a prescription for pain killers.  Well, I thought everything was fine and I just needed rest but when I returned to work on Monday with a black eye, my headache came back.  My friend at work took my back to the hospital.  and the doctor told me that my eye was hemorrhaging and I would need surgery immediately to save my eyesight.  He added, ""Thank God your friend brought you back to the hospital.""  I had to stay overnight at the Hospital.  It looks like I won't be having that garage sale for a couple of weeks now.  I will definitely be more careful when sorting through all my junk in the basement.  I thank God I didn't knock myself out with that dang old trophy.  I think I will throw that thing away when I get home.",,3EFE17QCRDRQUHLDANPUHP4QFXDHS7
