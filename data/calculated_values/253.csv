I never would have thought I would be where I am. I set some goals and I achieved them. This is really the first time in my life I set out to accomplish something and did. I can't even explain how great that feels. What I am most proud of is becoming a master case scholar in the United States. I have wanted this for so long and I put in so much work. I studied for weeks at a time it feels like. I totally gave up my social life. I dedicated all of myself to reaching this goal. My sister didn't think I could do it. She told me she would believe it when she saw it. She really doubted me. The only person who really gave me confidence was my sisters friend. In the end I accomplished my goal. My sister has since apologized for doubting me.,,31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBISVTT7T
