She is 4 months old now. I am still in shock that I was chosen to be her Godfather. I felt so important and honored that day, and I still do today. The responsibility of being a Godfather is important to me. I myself was raised by my Godparents after my parents passed away. The title means more to me than anything else in the world really. When my friend asked me to take on the responsibility I was so moved. I of course immediately said yes. Ever since then I have daydreamed about what I can do to ensure this little girl feels loved and safe. She has amazing parents, but the job of being a Godparent is much different than an actual parent. I get to have fun with her and spoil her without having to punish and teach. I am really excited for Christmas time. I saw a bunch of really pretty necklaces for baby girls that I want to buy. I just hope I can live up to the responsibility and form a meaningful relationship with this little girl. I love her so much already, it really is the greatest blessing to see your friends' have children.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK45CUJ8L
