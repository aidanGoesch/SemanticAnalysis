He told me the big news right away! He told me that they wanted me to be the godfather of their child. I was so happy and thrilled! I felt so loved. I accepted it right away! My friend and his wife told me that they knew how I had always wanted a child and wasn't able to have one. My friend asked if I was available to leave as soon as possible to meet the child and his wife. We both headed there straight away to their house. That is where I met their little baby girl. She was beautiful. She was fair skinned with her bright blue eyes. My friend's wife came to hug me and asked if I would be the godfather to which I answered yes in that moment. She handed me over her child to me. I held the child in my arm. It was so warm. It was a beautiful and touching moment.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK45CUJ8L
