The synthesizer! I had always had an interest in music, don't get me wrong. However, there was just an edge missing in the music I made. I wanted to make something unique, and cool. Everything I had made was a bit too dull, you know? It sounded too natural. I wanted to make something out of their world--Alien, in a sense, I suppose. I wanted to present something no one had listened to before. My friend told me about using synthesizers, and it changed my life. I started mixing music that sounded like it came from the stars. It was so fun to mess with the different settings. My music had a new edge, and I finally started enjoying it a lot. My music is my music now, for real. I can make sure it's unique and special in its own way, without relying on the constraints of physical instruments.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK45EW8JG
