I was not aware that they are a real thing that could be used to make music. They are fun and interesting to me. I started by watching videos about them and how they work. I learned about the different types of synthesis and how to make sounds. It was great fun and has lead me to continue down the path of music making. It has been a long journey but i am ready to begin using synthesizers and the other instruments that i can play to create this music. I listen to different types of music, but synthesizer music seems to be the easiest for me to create. It is fun and intuitive. When i think about the time that i spent learning, i feel accomplished. It is a great feat for me to learn a new skill. And my life is busy. I need an outlet to help me through. This is the way to do that. I am happy with my learning curve.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK45EW8JG
