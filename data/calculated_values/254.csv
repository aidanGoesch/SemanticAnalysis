I told my sister about my effort, I love my sister very much. My Activities She Knows Four, So I told them my goal. They said, ""You will not become a case scholar,They said you don't deserve that. I was very depressed hearing them. I told my friend about this, and he is a great lawyer. He recognized my plight and gave me hope. Some good words he said,1. Believe in yourself and you can2. There is no world in which you cannot3. You have no choice but to trust yourself4. Who cares about who you are and does not change your lifeHis advice thus changed my life and I am today a very good advocate.  I have a 10 person job under me. People in my city tell me to settle their cases. But those who criticized me are in the same place,  So I have come to realize that faith is always necessary in life.  God is a true friend.",,31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBISVTT7T
