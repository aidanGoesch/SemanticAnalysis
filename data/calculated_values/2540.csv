My parents and I live in the United States and do not get to see our family from Japan very often, as plane tickets are expensive. My family from Japan came to visit my parents and I in the United States a few times. The last time was over five years ago. They really love coming to visit us and always have had such a great time every single visit. This was my first time visiting Japan with my parents and I was really excited. I am not fond of long plane rides, but was excited to see Japan and my family. My cousins are around my age and were looking forward to doing fun things with me. The main point of our visit was a graduation gift for me from my family. When we arrived at my families beautiful home, everyone jumped out and said ""surprise""! After a long plane ride , we were very, very surprised. There were so many people there. So many family members and family friends there to welcome us. There were beautiful decorations and such dlicious food that my family made just for my parents and I. All the food was home cooked with the best ingredients.  My aunt and grandmas sister gave very emotional speeches about how proud they were of me and how important family and success is. It actually brought a tear to my eye.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4X59J8E
