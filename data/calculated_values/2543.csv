I am not as motivated as my other peers. They can get a crate of cans put up on the shelves in one hour. I can only do half a crate in the same time. I feel lazy because of this. I need to get faster at putting cans up. I asked them for motivation. They said to just keep focused on the task at hand. I will try that next week. I need to get a belt for my back. It has been hurting after putting cans up at the end of the day. I'll ask for a belt next week. The pay is alright. I'm hoping of getting a raise. I doubt I'll get a promotion with this work speed. This will be a hard task to accomplish.,,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4X5BJ8G
