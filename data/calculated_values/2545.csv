I had already gained some experience in the field and thought I would do a good job right away. As the days keep going by I am now starting to think I may have over-estimated my abilities. I need more coaching that I thought I would and even after 4 months I still feel like a new employee. I like my work enviroment and everyone seems to be nice and helpful but I still feel like I don't quite fit in yet. Last week as I was talking to one of my co-workers she mentioned she got a raise. She started 3 weeks before me. I'm feeling a bit anxious as to find out if I will be getting one too. I feel puzzeled and I am already feeling like I may not be as good of a fit for this job. If I don't recieve a raise I will be embarresed as to ask for extra help to learn things. I guess at this point the best I can do is wait and don't get over my feeling about this. I have to understand that I do not have certain skills yet and I need to just focus and keep working. Time is testing me I feel like. What could be the best way to handle myself when I feel inferior? I have to keep myself in a positive and calm state of mind.,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4X5BJ8G,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4X5BJ8G
