I was getting sad because she was getting sick. I took her to the vet. They said was really sick. I didn't have enough money for the operation to save her. I asked them to put her done. It's been 5 months now since this happened. I'm sad about it all the time. I get depressed when I think about it. I miss her all the time and think about her. I wish I would have had more time with her. When she had passed I tried to decide where to bury her. She always loved being in the back yard and so that is where I thought her final resting place should be. I buried her in my garden. It was where she felt the safest. She was happiest there and I think it where she will be happy to have laid her body to rest.,,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WS1WT6X9
