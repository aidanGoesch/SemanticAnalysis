I was on a hike with a couple of my friends and we were hiking in a forest. We were having lots of fun and we were joking around and giving each other a hard time. The topics of discussion involved mostly girls and relationships.  A friend of ours had recently broken up with his girlfriend so we were talking about how hard it is to date nowadays. We each gave examples of how bad our dating lives had been in the past. When we reached the top of the mountain, we did barbecue and had some kebabs. For some reasons, my stomach wasn't in the mood for kebabs and and started giving me trouble. I started wanting to go to the bathroom so much and asked my friends if there was a bathroom around. They all laughed at once because there was no way that forest had a bathroom. They advised me to go in the woods and finish my business there. I looked for a very hidden area and went there to defect. I was surprisingly comfortable and unafraid. As I was defecting, I saw a red shaped fruit and I tasted it. It had one of the weirdest tastes ever. I couldn't even know what I was eating. I went back to be with my friends and we had the greatest time of our lives. It was so much fun!",,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WSAFN6XE
