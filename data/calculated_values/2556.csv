I feel like someone reached into my guts and starting pulling everything out. Three weeks ago my brother passed away suddenly. The shock from receiving the news still hasn't worn off. I still think that the phone is going to ring and my brother will be on the other end, asking if I want to come over to watch the game. What am I supposed to do now? We spent so much time together, almost daily. The void left by his absence makes me feel like I am being pulled out of my own body. I remember a time when we went to the football game together. The tickets were pretty cheap and the weather was bitter cold. We still had a ton of fun. My brother even had an entire beer spilled on him after a touchdown was scored. We both looked at each other and started to laugh. He was a good person. He was my best friend.",,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WSB346X8
