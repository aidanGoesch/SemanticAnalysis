We have a fairly large family as it is with a lot of relatives but whenever there was a party, a get together or some other kind of event we always connected and enjoyed each others company. In his later years he was battling dementia and kidney failure. His short term memory was almost non existent. I found myself answering the same question 5-6 times in a matter of 5 minutes. I knew his days were numbered and my girls were also having a hard time with it.  He passed about 3 weeks ago so its still a very fresh hurt and considering the relationship we had it will hurt for a very long time. We will now be helping his wife get their house in order. She has a son that lives in Florida. She will be moved out by Thanksgiving ans relocating to FL. Our goal is to eventually live in GA and theirs is too. So, we know that our paths will be crossing at least one more time in this lifetime. We actually have friends that live in GA, right now. We vacation there often and we have chose that area to end up. in.",,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WSB346X8
