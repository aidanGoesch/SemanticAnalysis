I grew stronger by supporting and loving myself. They hurt me a lot. I considered a lot of different things during their time away, I felt suicidal. I felt worthless. I felt all sorts of negative emotions. I grew a lot stronger after going to therapy. After bringing new people into my life. Trauma has shaped who I am as a person. I still deal with the ways I felt during that time and it hurts. It hurts that somebody I adored more than anything could just leave me behind. I lost not only my bestfriend. But my world. Things still aren't the same but, we're trying I suppose. And that's what counts.",31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBIUKTT79,
