Recently, about 4 weeks ago I found out that my son had started using substances again. I found out in the worst way possible. I noticed that I was missing about $80 dollars. I know this because I keep a close watch on what I spend and document everything. Anyways, I'm actually surprised that he admitted to me that he took the money for drugs and that he's very sorry. He also agreed to do house work that I had been needing to do in order to compensate me for what he took. I'm upset with him, and slightly shocked that he would steal from me for drug money. But he really seems to be remorseful for it, and the fact that he didn't deny it when asked, and also agreed to go to meetings and reach out to people for help, and then has been actually going to those meetings for the past few weeks makes me hopeful for him. I try really hard to be supportive of him. He also opened up to me about the events that led up to the relapse. He lost his long time girlfriend of 4 years. Also, around the same time he was let go from his job because of an argument with management. He felt like he had nothing left is what he told me. I responded by saying I would help him look for jobs, if he agreed to get sober. So far, so good.",,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WSC4QX6O
