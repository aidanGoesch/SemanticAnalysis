Although he has been experimenting with drugs, mainly smoking marijuana, he did not develop a serious addiction until he moved from our home in Florida to Chicago. There he became intimate with a meth dealer and got so deep in addiction that he lost his job and then his apartment and for most of the remainder of his time in Chicago he was virtually homeless, sleeping on friends' couches and occasionally in the park. Last November my husband and I helped him come back to Florida, thinking it was his best chance to get clean. Unfortunately, in our hometown meth, my son's drug of choice, seems to be available on every corner and in every bar. He would manage to not use for a few days and then would jump right back in, sometimes for days at a time. On at least one occasion he stayed up using meth and other substances for a straight seven day period. In April his addiction reached critical mass and he attempted suicide in his desperation. A good friend of his, a recovering alcoholic himself, helped my son get into a detox facility in a nearby town and then to their rehab center. After that he lived for a few months in a recovery home and has done very well since. Three weeks ago, his half bother on his dad's side of his family hung himself and did not survive. My son was devastated as they were very close. He handled it extremely well but I was concerned that this tragic even could trigger a relapse. Shortly after that his roommate ended up in the hospital with liver problems. Last week he called me and told me that he had indeed relapsed, but that, thankfully, it was a one time event and was not his usual meth, but cocaine. He also reached out to his sponsor and to his counselor at the rehab center. Even though he did relapse I was not devastated or overly disappointed as I would have been in the past. Relapse is a common thing in drug and alcohol recovery and he had some serious triggers confront him in a short period of time. I told my son not to beat himself up over his relapse and stressed how proud I was of the way he handled it. To the best of my knowledge he has continued to go to meetings and maintain close contact with his sponsor. He is dealing with his relapse in all the right ways and I have every reason to believe he will pick himself  up and start over on the path to recovery he had already set for himself.",,3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WSC4QX6O
