I have three young kids whom are currently out of school. Some days are better than other, I wish that they could get along better and play nicely. I am turking and doing my full time job, and need to give them my attention and also juggling three kids. I try to do at least one fun thing a day and spend some time outside. We play games, legos, block and do a lot of arts and crafts. My middle child loves to color and create things, he is very creative for his age. I love being able to spend time with them and watch them do things, and I feel guilty that I am counting down the days that school starts. I do not know how my wife does this all year long and when I am out of town on business. I know people always say that being a stay at home parent was a thankless job, but I never really understood until now. It really has only been a month and my wife only works part time but it really is exhausting sometimes. I really can understand my wife's perspective now. I hope that I am able to keep this in mind and be more helpful going forward. We have a lot of activities we do through the year and are always pretty busy. I will try to be more mindful and helpful when I am around.",,3EICBYG645I6E6R7112FEXGNNF8CJT
