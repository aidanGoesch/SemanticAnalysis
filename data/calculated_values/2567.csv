I wasn't set to give birth to our son for another month. While braxton-hicks contractions are normal at this stage, these were definitely not false labor pains. Three weeks ago, I delivered our 4th son, Van, via cesarean section in an emergency delivery. His umbilical cord was tied in a complete knot, and he was not getting the life-sustaining support he needed as a result. Even though he was early, he thrived. I wasn't at all surprised because he was utterly active in the womb, which is probably how he ended up in the situation he was in. He spent every waking moment kicking and keeping me awake. He's very much like this now! My husband told me that when they took him, he was blue and not breathing. They quickly got him breathing, and though I was completely out at the time, I feel in my heart that I could hear his first cries. Even though this memory was not something solidly formed in my brain, it is something I know in my heart. This memory will stay with me forever. I am blessed to have him in my life. This was probably the most traumatic experience I've ever had, but seeing his smiling face every day has made it all worth it.",,3EJJQNKU9SRET2L0VYPPRFZU9PJRHM
