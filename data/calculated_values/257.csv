I have lost so much respect for so many people, and gained that respect for others. I have lost the love of my life, only to have them come back into my life. Not talking to this person was the most mentally handicapping thing, and physically destroying thing I've ever been through. But recently things have gotten better after their return, I feel much better as of late. Things are starting to improve as I grow with this person and begin to trust them again. It's very hard to go through losing someone so vital to your life. I never thought I would see them again, nor hear from them again. And that was mentally challenging thing ever. Knowing they knew the most about me, and how to help when I was mentally gone was harsh. I didn't know what to do without them. They taught me coping mechanisms and how to handle myself. Being alone during that time lead me down a very dark path. I relapsed in a lot of things I shouldn't have, and I think that's one of my biggest regrets. I'm so happy I have this person back again.",31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBIUKTT79,31Z0PCVWUL1UGSSGME880HBIUKTT79
