I WAS VERY MUCH WORRIED FOR HIM. HIS DRUG ADDICTION BECAME VERY SEVERE BEFORE 5 MONTHS THAT EVEN HE FORGOT TO EAT FOR OVER A WEEK. THEN I WAS VERY MUCH DETERMINED TO BRING HIM OUT OF THAT ADDICTION. I ISOLATED HIM FROM THE THINGS THAT MADE HIM ADDICTED. THEN I TOOK HIM TO COUNSELING AND RECREATIONAL CLASSES FOR A MOONTH. HE STARTED TO RECOVER SLOWLY FROM HIS ADDICTION. THEN I MANAGED TO GET HIM A JOB. NOW HE IS GOOD. THE SURPRISING THING IS THAT HE HAVE NOT TOUCHED DRUGS FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS. NOE HE IS LOOKING FORWARD TO FIND A NEW WOMAN FOR HIS LIFE AND START OVER HIS LIFE. THUS I MANAGED TO RECOVER MY FRIEND FROM AN ADDICTION. ALSO I AM PROUD THAT I MADE HIM A GOOD HUMAN BEING. NOW THINGS SEEM NORMAL TO US. I HOPE THAT HE GETS MARRIED SOON.,,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39R96ZE
