It was terrible, and a week later I went to his funeral. We said goodbye to him. We keep in touch with his family, they are like family now. His sisters really took it hard, and from time to time we all get together to have lunch and remember brian.",3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39R96ZE,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39R96ZE
