She was the light of my life, my angel. I love all my kids, my daughter Ernesta and my sons Vinny and Romeo: I just love my daughter more. Is it wrong for a parent to say that? It's true. About half of the family came into town for the birthday party, can you believe that shit? After everything I do for them, they can't even find the god damn time to celebrate my beautiful baby girl. I was pissed I tell you, how could they ruin the big day like this! On top of that, my son Vinny, that little shit, wouldn't stop crying about wanting to play with his Nintendo, instead of playing with his cousins! What has this world come to... when I was his age you couldn't keep me inside for 30 minutes, and that's all kids want to do these days! On top of one kid bitching and moaning the whole day, her other brother Romeo spent all night doing God knows what, and almost slept through the whole damn thing! What a fucking mess I tell you, these ungrateful little brats. All I wanted was for my baby girl to have the time of her life and this is the shit I have to deal with... Other than that, it was nice to see some of the family. It's hasn't been like it used to, like before Barb got sick, but it was good to see what the rest of the family was up to, how the nieces and nephews were doing. I couldn't help but laugh as we kicked the shit about the good old days, at grandma and grandpa's farm... It would've been nice to have seen my older brothers, Michelangelo and Rafael, but apparently they had a job to work and couldn't make it. It couldn't have been that hard to make time for us, could it? It sucks, but what can I say, that's life...",,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39WR6Z6
