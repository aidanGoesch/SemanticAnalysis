Trying to be friendly I asked where in Africa they were going.  They gave me a strange look, said something in foreign language and left.  I paid it no mind and shut the door.  I continued to see my neighbor sporadically throughout the weeks and things were friendly.  I stopped my exercise routine and joined a gym.  My apartment is much to small for exercising anyway.  One day while in the elevator I saw my neighbor and asked how her friends' trip was.  She said they were still there but should be back soon.  The elevator door then opened and I stepped out and wished her good day.  Two weeks later there was a knock on my door.  It was my downstairs neighbor accompanied by her two friends from before.  I greeted them and asked if I was being too loud.  I had recently been cleaning and my music and horrible singing were a little loud.  They said no so I asked if they wanted to come in.  As they came in I noticed what looked to be a large box in the hall.  I asked what's in the box?  They replied ""you're new pet'  Confused I opened the box to find a cage with a beautiful parrot.",,320DUZ38G88JVI7C3NYY4O124K2GJI
