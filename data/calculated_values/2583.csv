Being far away from our best friends is hard but one day after this whirlwind military lifestyle, we will be able to add roots.  We were suppose to go to their house this year because we alternate locations but instead they came to us since the hubby is on a crazy work schedule.   The day started out moggy and hot, that should have been our first sign that we were in for an adventure.  We pack all 8 kids, the coolers, the trailer with our camping gear and lots of sunscreen and bug spray.  The GPS says it will take 4 hours to drive to the river.  Boys are in one vehicle, girls are in the other.  We take our time on the drive because tonight will just be s'mores and a bonfire.  We finally make it to our campground around 3:00pm.  We unpack the vehicles and trailer so we can get the two tents up before dark.  After an hour, we have the tents up and have started setting up chairs, fire pit, coolers, food, and horseshoes.  Around 6pm, we start cooking hotdogs and just hang out for the night.  We know that we will have to be up by 9am to get ready for the river.  The kids are excited because they get to float by themselves for the 1st time.  Next morning, we make some eggs and bacon, zip the food into the tents, and clear the trash away.  We load onto the bus so it can take us to the river, we have a 6 mile float ahead of us.  Everyone gets their tube and life vest on, we tie up the little kids to an adult.  The river is much faster than the previous kayak tour we did at another place.  About an hour in, we started hitting the rafts, and it was hard to navigate the wood sticking out of the river.  In the 3rd hour, 4 of us got slammed into the wood and bashed our legs up.  Thirty minutes from that, pouring rain on the river.   Finally after an hour of waiting we got back in the river.  The last 3 hours were amazing, did not want it to stop.  We we finally reached the end point, we did not want to call it a night so we swam in the river, jumping off the cliffs and rope swing for the next two hours.  It was an amazing camping trip that I will never forget.",,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC3HLY6ZZ
