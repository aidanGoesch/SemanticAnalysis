He had just gotten a new couch and tv and I wanted to see it. You know I love couches and the tv was the biggest one he had ever had. I got into my car and started going to his home. About 20 minutes into the ride, a car swerved into my lane and hit my car. Luckily, none of us were hurt! I got out and checked on them and made sure they were okay. I then called the cops and me and the other driver started talking. She was young, had a kid in her car and told me that she didn't have insurance and was really sorry. We talked some more and I started to feel bad about her situation. She was crying and didn't know what to do. She had just gotten laid off from work, couldn't get a babysitter because she had no money. It was really said. When the cops finally arrived, we filled out paper work and she told them she didn't have insurance. She got a ticket for that and broke down. I had so little damage on my car that I told her that I wasn't going to file anything. I'll just repair this and she didn't have to worry about anything. She was so relieved about that! I felt better about the situation as well.",,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC3J3WZ6S
