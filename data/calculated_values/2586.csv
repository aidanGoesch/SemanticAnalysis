I was in the kitchen when I started having labor pains. I didn't think much of them at first, but they got worse. My husband came home and we raced to the hospital. There, they put me in a room, and I waited. There were doctors and nurses everywhere. They hooked me up to lots of machines. I wasn't able to stay awake. When I woke up, the baby was out. They had done a C-section. Something had happened so that I needed one. Now I have a bad infection, and some issues with the surgery. Apparently there's some internal damage. I'm working with insurance and a lawyer to try and get things fixed up. But my baby's so sweet! I may be hurt, but at least she's alive.",,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCO54X2DU
