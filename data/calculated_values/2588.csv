I don't know why I couldn't have him naturally but I really wanted to so I was incredibly disappointed.  I was also set to have my tubes tied during the surgery since I figured I want to be done with children, with him being my 5th live birth and everything.  After the surgery was done I was super messed up on a ton of medication so I started regretting having my tubes tied.  I asked one of the nurses how the doctor performed the procedure as I know that some tubaligations are reversible.  I was then told that the doctor REMOVED both of my Fallopian tubes.  MUCH to my surprise, that is absolutely irreversible.  She went on to tell me that with IVF I would still be able to carry but given IVF is expensive, He is absolutely our last child.  I felt super violated, given I had no idea that parts of my body were going to be removed from me.  The doctor also performed kind of a plastic surgery on me she tucked some of my extra skin inside of me and sewed me shut.  Some people would think YAY but not me because the stitches couldn't hold all the extra skin.  About 5 days after my incision I noticed my skirt and panties were SOAKED. Like super duper wet.  It wasn't bloody but scary enough where i went to the emergency room. Its not everyday your clothing gets soaked from a strange liquid oozing from your incision.  The ER doctor told me I was doing too much and to slow down.  At my appointment a few days ago my physician told me there is a hole that looks like a person took their finger and poked my incision in a spot.  That was where a pocket of liquid was. It was all due to her performing extra surgical measures that weren't asked for.  SO now I am barren AND deformed.  Kids, man.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCO54X2DU,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCO54X2DU
