I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed. It has really changed my life in so many ways.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,
