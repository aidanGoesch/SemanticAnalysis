Luckily some other students had the same flight as me so we meet up and walked together and stuff it was also eye opening because everyone was older then me. Personally always had older friends but they were like in there 20s with kids and a house. I figured out a way to sneak acid onto the plane and into Italy(please dont report me) because on the trip i knew we were going to go to the beaches and walk around and even go to a volcano. The first meaningful experience for me i would say was going up to the top of this apartment building and realizing how crammed together everyone was it kinda bothered me but at the same time it was refreshing to see how a civilization can stay relatively the same throughout the years, and just how vast our planet is because i noticed we all think of our hometown then our city then maybe our state and maybe country but the world is so much bigger then to have such a small mindset at least thats what i realized on my trip. I also managed to drop my weeding ring in 30-40 ft into the ocean because i accidentally headbutted my professor in the vagina. Till this day i am so embarressed that that even happen in real life. After about 30min of me trying to find my ring i finally found it and i got back onto the boat. The boat ride lasted about 3-6hrs. Honestly we were out on the water the whole day off the aneolian(cant spell it) islands we stayed at this nice hotel which most of the island is anyways. But seeing the rocky beaches was very weird for me because naturally i wondered why none of the rocks have been broken down into sand. Turns out that theres still active volcanoes there. Later on in the boating day i decided to drop a quater tab and once it hit me i just felt as if i was really there. I didnt feel the need to take pictures or anything i was just truly 100% in the moment in the present and i loved that experience of knowing that in that moment im alive. But not only alive but my mind isnt wondering or thinking its there with me enjoying everything around it.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,
