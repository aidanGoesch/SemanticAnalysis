And the church is very far and I don't really have a car. It takes hours to travel to the church via public transportation. I set a goal to be faithful in my faith, but I also set a goal to make enough money for living. I have a friend who is a Republican, who owns a car, and who promised to give me a ride on last last Sunday, but when the Sunday comes, he never showed up, and he never answered his phone. I hate people who do not keep their promises, and he totally lost my trust on him by doing this. The fact that he is a Republican really bugged me (I did not know he is a Republican until next week), and I just can trust him anymore. In fact when he shares his thoughts in Sundays, he is very opinionated towards his political view, making everyone in the room feels uncomfortable. I totally look down on him now. And we had a debate last Sunday after church about the presidential election in 2020, and we both got really irritated after the discussion. I donâ€™t think it is a good way to spend Sunday like that! I kind of associate him with all the Republicans, which makes me kind of afraid of making new Republican friends in the future. Now I have always to ask beforehand is a person a Republican or not before really getting to know them. I reflected on myself that maybe I was too mean to that person. I should have thought through it more.",,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGI0D2B
