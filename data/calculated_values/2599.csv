I’ve been married for ten years - what I thought were ten happy years. I knew my husband had been unfaithful in the past but he convinced me it was a mistake and it would never happen again. I forgave him and I worked to make changes to better our marriage. But last week I found out he’s cheating again. This is such a disaster. I feel so hurt, betrayed, and taken advantage of. Fool me once, shame on me, it’s not going to happen again. I’ve already met with a divorce lawyer. I know I’m going to be ok but it just hurts so much. He was my best friend for ten years, and now our memories mean nothing. He is a stranger. Our son is going to have to grow up in a broken home. We’re going to have to sell the house and downsize and I’m going to have to work more hours. I’m just so sad and disappointed. I thought my life would look different but here I am. I wish I could just fast forward the next year of my life.",,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGI82D8
