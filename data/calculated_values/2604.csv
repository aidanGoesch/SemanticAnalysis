I bought my house a few years ago, and I always thought I'd get around to remodeling the dingy 70s kitchen at some point.  One morning I went down to the kitchen and found that a pipe had burst and water had leaked every where.  I was going to have to fix this now!  I called a buddy of mine that does renovations and interior design.  I had known him since college and I knew he does really good work.  He answered right away and we planned a time to meet.  We met a few times over the next few days and he planned an amazing new kitchen for me.  I could tell things were not going to be cheap.  We chose really nice finishes and new stainless steel appliances.  I chose a color palate of and gray and white with yellow accents.    My friend started the remodel.  My house was full of dust and debris, and I seemed to be bleeding money.  But my friend worked incredibly quickly and my new kitchen was done in only 9 days.  I was so over budget but when I saw the result I was blown away.  I feel like I'm living in an HGTV show and I love my new kitchen!",,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRJPFTJK
