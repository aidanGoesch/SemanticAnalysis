I woke up in the middle of the night because I needed to use the bathroom. While in route I stepped on something and it broke under my weight. It was a wine glass so it easily shattered. I ended up with a bloody mess. So I had to rush to the hospital. They ended up giving me stitches. Took hours. Eventually got back home and had to clean up the mess. By the time I got everything up it was time to go to work. Needless to say sleeping was not an option. I was exhausted all day. Just one very long night that didn't seem to end. I was so excited to crawl into bed the next night. It couldn't come fast enough.",,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIX2POG55
