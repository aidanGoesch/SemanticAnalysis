I had woken up around 4 am and needed to use the bathroom so I got out of bed and began to make my way over there when after taking about 5 steps I stepped right on a wine glass that had been mistakely left ther from the previous night. The glass shattered and shards of all sizes pierces and sliced all over the bottom of my foot. I couldn't move so I screamed for my mom and it took a few minutes for her to hear me but finally se did and she came upstairs and saw what happened. She said it looked like a crime scene in my room because of all the blood. She said we were going to have to go to the ER and as much as I hate hospitals and doctors I knew she was right. So I managed to hobble into the car and once we got there I was seen reletively quickly. It was a horrible experience because the doctor had to numb te area before sewing it up but I kept feeling the pain as she tried to begin. It was very painful. She said my body was metabolizing the pain killer too quickly. It took about 5 stabs with a huge needle right into the wound before it got numb enough for her to sew it up. Finally I got to leave. I was on crutches for a few weeks and I still to this day have the scars, the one in the middle of my foot still hurts. I assume it probably will for a while but it could have been a lot worse. I won't be leaving wine glasses on the floor anymore.",,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIX2POG55
