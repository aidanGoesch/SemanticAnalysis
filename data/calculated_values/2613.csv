At the time I was ready to continue my dive training and was in the process of first obtaining my rescue diver certification. However, since that time my situation has recently changed so I am currently putting my Dive Master training on hold. I have relocated to Las Vegas and am now pursuing new and exciting opportunities there. I will still look to obtain my Dive Master certification at some point and will continue to find diving locations here in Las Vegas. Once I am settled in I will look to find a local dive shop where I can resume my training. I have already looked into possible destinations. I only have a few remaining certifications to obtain but they are ones that will take quite some time to obtain. Master Diver involves more theory than actual diving. Advanced Rescue Diver will expand on what was taught in the first course. There are a few other minor certifications to obtain but then I can finally work on my Dive Master certification. Only the near future will tell when I am able to accomplish this. Luckily it is a goal that doesn't need to be achieved overnight. Diving will always be an option and is an activity I can partake in at my locations. I am looking forward to it.",3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXDJ7G5N,
