I have become quite frustrated at the lock of opportunity at my current place of employment. I have continuously been strung along and passed over for promotions due to the nature of nepotism that is a part of the department that I work for. So far there have been about 6 times that this has happened to me. This has lead to my decision to focus on something I am very passionate about which is Scuba diving. Currently I am working on my rescue diver certification which leaves me only a few certifications away from my goal. Next I will work on Master Diver which focuses more on dive theory than physically diving. After that will be the advanced rescue certification. The final step after that will finally be to start Dive Master training. That certification is the one that will take some amount of time. I am looking forward to achieving my goal in the coming months. It is a process that will take some time but one I am greatly looking forward to. Becoming a Dive Master will present unique opportunities in the future. I love diving and being out on the water. I'm looking forward to it with great enthusiasm.,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXDJ7G5N,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXDJ7G5N
