We have been waiting for this moment for 23 years! My wife and I have always dreamed about our kids having a grandchild but we were doubtful it was ever going to happen. Our children said they were never going to have kids and were not interested in the thought. When we got home with him there wasn’t a thing I could do but look into his tiny blue eyes! He was such a small bundle of joy and so innocent. It brought so much joy to my wife as we haven’t had a baby in the house for 15 years. She was so compassionate about caring for him and it brought a new spark to her life. You could see it in her eyes that she wanted another child to take care of since our nest has been empty for so long. We were giving him a bath when she turned to me and asked can we keep him? They didn’t even want to have a child and now they have been blessed with this beautiful baby boy. I told her no but we will always welcome him in our home with open arms. We did not agree on this subject and she demanded we find a way to keep him or adopt our own. I don’t know what to do about this situation now because we are getting up there and age. All I know  is that I love this boy and he is always welcome in my home. I hope my wife will be able to understand my stance on her wishes.,,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXMDVG58
