The love a andmother has for a grandchild is immense. At the time when my daughter was pregnant she was having a difficult time financially. I sent for her to come live with me for the duration of her pregnancy.  It was a long hard pregnancy, but she made it. My grandson was born April 23 2017. It was a pefect day for such a great event. He was born looking just perfect like an angel. I was so proud to be his grandma and instantly couldn't wait to show him off. I took so many pictures that it was abscurd. Unfortunately, my daughter fell ill after she gave birth. My grandson was released by the hospital to me. I was the first person to take him out of the hospital an take him home. I had everything set up and ready for him. It was such an awesome and overwhelming feeling. I haven't had a baby in awhile so it felt ackward but I quickly got back into the swing of things. I had my grandson for his first two weeks all to myself. We formed an inseperable bond. There is nothing I wouldn't do for him I travel 450 plus miles to get him everal times a year. He stays with me 9 months out of the year. I am very proud to be his grandma. He is now 2 and is excelling in everything he does. And it is clear that everything he knows his grandma taught him. It is also clear that he loves me just as much as I love him.",,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXMDVG58
