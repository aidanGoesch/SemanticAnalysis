The dog was just wondering around by itself without a leash. I thought that was kind of weird, so I decided to get it on a leash and to take it home. It seems that dog was underfed and skinny, so  I got it some food. It munched down the food ravenously like it hasn't ate in a while. I'm glad that I fed it, but my home's no place to keep pets. I rented the place out and the owner was clear that no pets are allow there. So in the end, despite wanting to keep the dog, I had to take it back to where I found it. Once there, I asked around and managed to find the owner of the dog. The owner didn't seem to care much that I got his dog back, but he took it back in regardless. There wasn't much I could do. So I just left. But to this day I still think of the dog and whether it was okay or not being with that owner. I hope it's not being underfed again. I just hope that at least it's still in the house and not out somewhere wondering around.",,320DUZ38G88JVI7C3NYY4O12S1ZJG4
