He took her on an amazing hike on a Sunday and proposed on top of a mountain. We were all so excited!!! He facetimed us and we all couldn't wait. Afterwards, he came back to our town for a party. I got my hair and makeup done so i would be ready. We all knew it was coming so we had our outfits prepared. Her parents hosted the party in their backyard. It was so fun! They had a beautifully stocked bar with lots of alcohol. We took so many shots and amazing cocktails. We also had a lot of snacks and passed around food. We took such great photos and danced all night. After lots of drinking, everyone decided to go night swimming. We all changed into bathing-suits and jumped in the pool. It was so fun! It was such a fabulous party.",3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS337K9W,
