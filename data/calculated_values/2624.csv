One of my old coworkers reached out to me about a job opening at his company. He mentioned the salary range, as well as the role and job description. Immediately, I was intrigued, as this fell directly in line with my skill set. Unfortunately, the job was with a company that was over 3,000 miles away from my current home. However, he mentioned he put in a good word for me, and they might reach out to discuss the opportunity with me. I had a call with the HR team associate last week. After a cordial conversation, I was scheduled to meet with the Vice President of the company. Four days ago, we had this meeting. I discussed that I was currently living over 3,000 miles away, however, I felt that the company values aligned with me and my skill set. After some back and forth, the Vice President asked me what it would take to have me onboard with the company. I mentioned that I would need to be able to work from my current location and report remotely. Although this was not the normal protocol for the company's employees, they wanted me aboard. I was offered the position yesterday with the ability to work from home! I have never experienced this before, and it is very exciting, especially since I get to work with such a cool company. I feel very fortunate to be able to have this opportunity and am excited to start working!",3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS5VZ9KZ,3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS5VZ9KZ
