It was a simple affair in the backyard of a friend's house. She was marrying her girlfriend of 5 years.  My parents were there as well as my dad's sisters.  Also in attendance were her girlfriend's family and friends.  The service was lovely.  Both brides tried to hold back tears of joy as they gave their vows.  Those tears also brought tears to the audience's eyes.  Afterward, were took pictures with the brides.  While we were doing that, the food was starting to be served.  Everything was cooked by various guests of the wedding.  The best food served was the burnt ends brought by my dad.  The barbecue on them tasted great and the meat was so soft and chewy.  It really felt like it came from a professional.  Overall, it was a very fun experience.  I believe those 2 will be together for the rest of their lives.  They are perfect for each other.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ
