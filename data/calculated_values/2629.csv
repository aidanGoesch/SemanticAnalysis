The first friend I spent time with at her birthday dinner at a korean BBQ place, the second friend I spent time with at her house to watch a movie. Dinner at the BBQ place was super fun and I was most surprised to see a soju tower on the house when I showed up. It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out. The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house. I was also surprised by how many people showed up. I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while. This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens. It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too. I had a really good time during the dinner. I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting. Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her. But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them. Afterwards I met up wit my other friend to watch a movie. This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to. It was the first time she was finally living on her own, and it was nice to see her slowly going into adulthood more. I had a really good experience writing this because it made me feel all these happy feelings I felt when I was going to the party and to my friend's house. It's pretty funny too how I forgot I even did this task and I could not remember what I had even written about.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRCW7MC,
