I was driving home and I noticed an old dog trying to cross the road. The dog was clearly old by the way it moved and it was not even wearing a collar. I got worried about it's safety so I jumped out and got a collar and leash and i had in my trunk. The dog seemed friendly enough but they were clearly scared of me and I didn't want to put it in more danger so I kind of shepherded it towards the side of the road. From there I was able to approach the dog and get close enough to put a collar and leash on it. Ok so where do I go from here I thought to myself as the dog had no collar or tags, and it was slightly past 9:30 at night. Thankfully my house was close by so I walked the dog into my garage and gave it some dog treats and water as it looked exhausted. This gave me some time to figure out what I would do next. I ended up making a big sign that I could post on the  street corner nearby thinking that its owners would be out looking for it. After the dog was refreshed a bit from some food and water I got a new idea. Since I couldn't call animal control at that time of night, I was left with a few options. Keep the dog for the night and call for it to be picked up in the morning. Or put the leash back on the dog and see if it would try to walk its way home. I chose the latter so off we went in the dark following the road until we got a few blocks away from where I lived. At this point the dog was trying to turn off of the road into some very dark paths and I was hesitant to go off the beaten path with my new friend. At this point a car turned onto the street and pulled into it's driveway, I thought It would be a good chance to ask a neighbor if they had a clue whose dog this was. As luck turns out they new the dog and pointed me to the home where it's family is and other than an awkward door knocking situation late at night everything went well and I was able to reunite the dog with its family.",,320DUZ38G88JVI7C3NYY4O12S1ZJG4
