A month ago I went to my friend's birthday party. We had dinner at a korean bbq restaurant. The restaurant was far away so I ended up carpooling with friends that also were going to the party. They picked me up at around 5 PM but had to make a stop at Target first because some of my friends had not bought a birthday gift yet. They ended up buying makeup for the birthday girl and a card and we were on our way. I already had bought a gift from Amazon so I did not buy anything at Target. We were one of the first people to get to the restaurant so we got to pick which table we wanted to sit at and thankfully we all got to sit together. It was interesting because my friend had invited 25 people, so many people who were invited I did not even talk to. Most of us did not even talk to the birthday girl because she was sitting at a different table from most of us. I ended up sitting with people that I knew, so it was as if I just went to go out to eat with these people for no occasion. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so good and I had good conversation. The food was expensive and so was the commute (1 hour), but I still think it was worth it. I got my friend a pusheen plushy and she seemed to really like the gift. Afterwards my friend I was sitting next to at the restaurant asked if I wanted to go see a movie at her apartment, so I did and we watched Zootopia.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRCW7MC,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRCW7MC
