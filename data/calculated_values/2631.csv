This was a devastating time in our lives.  My mom has been unsure, because of her advanced age, on what she wants to do in regards to treatment.  She can choose to do nothing and let the cancer run it's course and if that is her decision the doctors believe that should would have less than 2-3 years left to live.  Our my mom can choose to seek treatment which would require surgery, radiation, and rounds of chemotherapy over a course of the year. We are all frightened and scared, but ultimately we know that this is her decision and we must let her make it.  We can not choose the best course of action for her as only she knows or has some idea of what she wants. It's very hard to watch someone you love grapple with such a immense decision and try to select the correct choice.  Only having two plans of actions makes it very difficult. My father passed away around 4 years ago and to watch him die slowly over the course of several months was very hard.  To watch my mother die will probably be worse as she is the only parent I have left and to lose her would be devastating.  I love my mom though and what ever she decides, what ever plan of action she wants to take, I will stand beside her and support her.  I will hold her hand in life as I will hold it in death and I will always be with her and she with me because we are part of each other. So what every you choose Mom.  What every you want.  I will be by your side.  Your middle child will always be there.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70
