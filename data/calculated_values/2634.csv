My mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. Many years ago I had experienced cancer with my father. However, this felt a bit different. Maybe it's because of my age or just all I've learned in life. I was very angry when I found out. My mom has always been the rock to my family and my best friend. My mom has always just been a call away. I quickly realized that if I didn't have my mom just a call away I would be in a mess. For weeks I couldn't talk about without getting emotional. I did a lot of research and started talking to others that I trust. I went with my mom to as many doctor's appointments as possible. I was there with her through her surgery and the news that it was an aggressive form of cancer and that if it hadn't been found soon it would have been a lot worse. She went through a week of radiation. She did overall well. Soon after we found out that chemo was recommended to help greatly reduce the risk of recurrence. At first it was emotionally hard because I could only think about seeing my mom without hair and possibly weak. Now I realize that I will stand behind my mom and her decisions. I need my mom around for a very long time. While the past few months have been difficult it has also made me a stronger person.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70
