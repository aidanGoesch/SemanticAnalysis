We had to travel for several hours to get there. We were looking forward to it and thought it would make a nice outing. However, there were storms in the state, but we thought they would not reach Tulsa. During our drive, it began storming. The rain was extremely heavy and there was a lot of lightning and thunder. We were driving on a turnpike and had no opportunities to find a place and park and wait out the storm. It was the weekend, so there were a lot of other cars on the road. I had to keep calming my sons even though I was just as stressed as scared as they were. I kept watching the weather app on my phone as my husband drive in blinding rain. We finally reached Tulsa, but took the wrong highway because it was raining too hard to see the road signs. We managed to pull into a convenience store to try and get our bearings. Before I could look at a map, nearby tornado sirens began wailing and my phone received an emergency text informing us that a tornado warning had been issued. My oldest son began to panic, but I hugged him and kept talking to him calmly. We waited until the all-clear signal was given and then went to the party. We found out that a tornado had actually touched down one block south of where we were located. It only caused a small amount of damage. Not long after we arrived at the party the storm dissipated and the skies cleared. Despite the frightening storms, we had a great time at the party. We all kept hugging each other and taking photos. I probably took over three dozen photographs and each person was smiling in them. I think were all so relieved that we made it there safely that everything after that was very enjoyable.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZ957MN,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZ957MN
