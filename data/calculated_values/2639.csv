My family and I made a trip a few months ago over to India! We have some friends and family there. I came to the United States to go to college and never wanted to move back. I met my wife in school and we have 2 children now. My folks are dirt poor as they live in India. They pretty much spend their days scrapping whatever they can get out of trash piles. Because the country is so retarded they don't know how to properly dispose of waste. Anyways, we decided that the kids would want to see their grandparents. And we thought that it would give the kids a good perspective and they may learn something. We had been there before but they were too young to be able to really understand what was going on. We really enjoy spending the time with the even though they are trash, and the country is also trash. Some of my friends who live here still though have done alright for themselves. We went and stayed a night with them as well. The food was amazing here! That's probably the biggest highlight for me outside of seeing friends and family. We joked about Donald Trump and how this may be our last trip here because of travel bans etc. that he has enacted.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZBYM7Z
