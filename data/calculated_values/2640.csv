It was especially important to visit them because the grandmother on my mom's side is still alive. Our cousin who just got married also showed up so that she could introduce her husband to our family. Everyone was happy to see us. It was weird to see all of the kid look so grown up from the last time we saw them. Many of them have now moved out or are in college now. This surprised me as there are not a lot of opportunities for people in India. I felt happy for them, but it made me feel sad to think of how fast time is moving. Whenever we go to India, it feels so peaceful as we don't have to worry about the stuff that we normally do. It feels good to be in a country where everyone looks like you rather than in a country where everyone looks at you. My uncles brought us a dog to keep us company, but I felt very bad for having it taken away from its parents. I ended up getting a lot of mosquito bites, but I was willing to suck it up. Leaving India was very sad for everyone involved. We are all getting older and probably won't be able to go to India in the future so easily. Every time we go everyone is happy to see us so it is equally sad when we have to go. My grandma probably doesn't have that long to live, and that might have been the last time we ever see her.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZBYM7Z,
