I think I am falling in love. It has been crazy how quickly this all happened. I was sitting at Tend Coffee Shop a few weeks ago drinking my coffee and playing on my phone. The place was pretty crowded but I was sitting alone. I heard a small voice ask if she could sit in the empty chair opposite me for a few minutes. I looked up as I said ""sure"" to see the most beautiful girl I have ever spoken to. It was like one of those cheesy romance movies. I swear there was light around her and her hair was blowing in the non existent breeze. I tried my best to act normal and make small talk. It seemed to have worked because by time we left I had a date for later that week. Her name was Amanda. She was going to school to be a dentist and she was absolutely perfect. A few nights later we met up at the Italian restaurant and we spent hours eating and talking. It felt so familiar and safe to talk to her. We have seen each other every day since then and we made things official last night. She is officially my girlfriend. I haven't felt this way about a girl ever.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1U9JT0EJ
