So, one day, I went inside. I got a coffee and sat down. I look across from me and saw this really cute girl by herself at the counter. For some reason, I decided to head up there. I asked if she was alone and she said yes. I asked if she would mind if I sat next to her and she said no. So, we sat there for a while and talked about life. Turns out, we shared a bunch of things in common. We had fun. We laughed. Afterward, we exchanged phone numbers. It was a really great time. Now, I have a date for this weekend. I'm really looking forward to it.",3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1U9JT0EJ,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1U9JT0EJ
