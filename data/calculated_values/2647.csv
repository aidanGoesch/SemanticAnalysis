I had to spent about 12 hours a day at this job just to get by making a little money. It was hard for me to get by at times due to the hours. Sometimes my checks would be good but often I had to work a lot. I didn't really have many days off either. Eventually I was able to get another job. This job was way better for me personally. I had made a major life change by switching jobs. I make a lot more money, and I took a lot of stress off me. Due to having to travel and work longs hours to get some money to get by. Now my commute it almost cut in half. I also don't have to work the long hours that I had to work at the old job. Overall I am excited and able to live more comfortable. I haven't had an issue with my new job yet.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1UIT50EO
