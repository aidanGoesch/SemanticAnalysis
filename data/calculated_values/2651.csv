He is first baby to be born in my family since I was born 25 years ago. He is the first child of my oldest brother and his wife. I drove up from NYC to Boston the day after he was born to meet him. I am very close with my brother, so meeting him was very emotional and sentimental in the hospital room, especially with my parents around. I felt an instant bond and I instantly fell in love with the little guy. He was the first newborn baby I ever got to hold and he was so squirmy! He also had a full head of hair, which was so soft and a gorgeous shade of light brown. His skin was so pink and smooth. I think he was pretty comfortable with me because he pooped while I was holding him. That got a laugh out of everyone, including the nurses. I can't wait to be there with him and watch him grow up. It was also so amazing seeing my brother and sister-in-law take on this new role. I'm sure they'll be great parents to my nephew. We've already joked about which baseball team he will be a fan of considering the rivalry between the NY Yankees and the Boston Red Sox.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1USP2E01
