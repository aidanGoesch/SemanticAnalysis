Out of the corner of my eye I saw blur of movement and than nothing.  I stopped walking and peered into the window of a nearby warehouse.  I saw a white blur and decided to see what was inside the warehouse.  Inside I found a litter of kittens.  Although I wanted to take all of them home I decided only to save one of them, the rest would have to fend for themselves.  I brought the snow white kitten home to my mother and siblings.  Immediately they were enthralled by the snow white beauty.  This cat has become a member of the family joining us in everything we do.  It enjoys different activities with each and everyone of my siblings and mother.  It acts quite like a human.  My mother is the proudest mother in all the world.  Having lost our father in a trucking accident we were in desperate need of something to bring the family together.  That spontaneous decision to roll a blunt and take a walk may have saved the entire family. Maybe some things are destiny.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1USSS0EJ
