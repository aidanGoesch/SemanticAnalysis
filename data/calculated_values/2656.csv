I've been to this amazing country twice before but only to Bali, which I love but is only a tiny section of Indonesia and this time I wanted to experience something. Yogyakarta was my state of choice and as soon as I landed I just knew I was in for a treat. Yogyakarta was absolutely astonishing, the energy and vibe here always had me on cloud 9 and smiling from ear to ear. The local people of Indonesia are amazing, friendly and welcoming. Yogyakarta is known as the cultural heart of Indonesia and I can see why. Even though Indonesia is well developed, with all the western accommodations, it doesn't feel overly developed, your surrounded by nature and still sticks to Indonesia's cultural roots. The food, the art, the temples and just the number of natural amazement's, there is a limitless amount of things you can find to do. While here I learned a bit more about the history of this country and even learned a few more words in Indonesian. I stayed amongst the locals, as well as places near trendy Main streets, with great hipster cafes, gelato shops, and high-end restaurants, however, the local street food had me coming back time and time again. I also enjoyed the time I spent with, other fellow travelers, exchanging travels stories and just getting to know one another. I hiked and camped on top on volcano mountains and swam in the most beautiful blue and turquoise oceans. I rode a motorbike through the streets, down to the countrysides and into local villages, and was always greeted with smiles and waves. I did yoga and mediated, whilst overlooking sunsets and sunrises. I loved my time in Yogyakarta Indonesia and will be visiting this beautiful country again.",3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3X62E7Y8,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3X62E7Y8
