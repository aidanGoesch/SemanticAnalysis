I was suffering through depression, which was coming back hard. I had gone through depression before, and thought I beat it, but I guess not, because it was coming back quickly. I was experiencing weight gain. I was sleepy, and uninspired, and my best friend not only noticed, but reached out to me and made sure to keep latched onto me so that he could help see me through it. He started by just bringing me some freshly made (by him) soup on a cold day. I didn't ask. He just brought it over, knocked on the door, and said eat this. It meant the world to me. No one else has ever done something like that for me, especially without asking for anything in return. I hadn't been eating, too, so that was something that started me on the path to recovery. After that, he began inviting me over more to play video games and relax, or go out for physical activities like walks and runs, which helped me get more Vitamin D in my system and just to get some more endorphins via activity. Also more socializing by hanging out and getting out of the house. He never once judged me for it, and never once asked for anything in return. And now that I'm fully back to health, and lost the weight, and feeling like a million bucks, I still stay in that same level of contact with him, knowing that one day it may be my turn to return the favor. And I want to be there if and when that does happen, because I've learned about the value of true friendship.",,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XIHBY72
