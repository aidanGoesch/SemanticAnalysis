We both gotten the switch the same month because our birthdays are only 3 days apart. We had a blast. We had bonded for several hours playing with and against each other through different video games. We had a bunch of time on the switch and we reminiscd aboit the old times we had growing up. We had friends over and some more family over as well. The bwat part of the day is when they brung out the liquor and we drank and talked more crap about our childhood. Me and my cousin was together all the time but as we gotten older we did not spend as much time together. But now that we had this party it made us a lot closer. My girlfriend had a great dinner set up as well. She made pasta garlic bread and brought chips and dip. We were crushing all of that foos. When they brung out thw cake we were so happy. We felt the intensity of our friends and family singimg the song. It was overall a great time with family.,323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLB7HQFHU,
