It was my graduation ceremony from the medical school. It happened a month ago. I received all the awards on ground. I'm still basking in the euphoria of the day. My parents were there to share the moment with me. I also had all my siblings around. I was emotional because a lot of memories kept coming to me. I remembered the first day in the college. I promised myself that day that i will give my best always. All my sacrifice paid off. Nights of reading and not sleeping paid off. I'm so proud of my achievement. I think my parents are more proud. This is just the beginning for me. I will always give my best to every task. I want to be the best doctor to my patient.,,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XIJCY77
