From ages 17-24 I had been doing a lot of drugs and partying with friends. I would honestly drink and drive quite a bit. Never had any problems. But then one night I got wasted. I left the rave alone at around 1am. I was wandering drunk and lost, couldn't find my car for an hour. Finally I find it just a block away but was too drunk to figure that out. I chose it's time to drive home about an hour away. I'm driving down the highway when I see a construction zone ahead. Somehow I managed to drive into the construction zone area instead of turning left to continue down the highway. Just as I was back out to leave the area a cop pulls up next to me. He asks me what I'm doing, I just say guess I'm a bit lost. Next thing I know I'm getting arrested for a DUI. I get taken to jail, car gets impounded. This was a very annoying period of my life and I have never drank and drove since.",,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XYW27YC
