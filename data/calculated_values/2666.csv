So I know it has been a while since I have written in you but I just wanted to keep you updated. About a month ago I woke up with some pretty bad tooth pain. Most of the morning I was in pain and finnaly ended up calling the doctor about it. They told me I should call my dentist as there was nothing they could do. So I call them and they told me that I had to wait until the next day in order to even see them. I tried taking pain meds and orajel and it did help a little bit but not as much as I hoped. So the next morning came around and I finnaly went there and the told me I needed a root canal! I was pretty nervous that it would hurt quite a bit but I knew in the long run it would be better for my teeth. So after about a 15 minute procedure it was all over. They were nice for the most part but boy did it hurt quite a bit. I would say after about 15 minutes it started to hurt worse but they did give me much better pain pills to deal with it. Later that night I was starting to feel a bit better. When I work up in the morning I was pain free and it was great. Overall I am glad I went and got it done quickly.,,3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1EYJ9QN
