Picked up my brother, sister in law, his 2 daughters, my mother, sister, and wife. We all went to Boston to the New england aquarium. Dropped everyone off. Then went and parked. Met up with everyone and went inside. Spent a fun filled 3 hrs there.  My nieces had a great time. Really got to enjoy everything the place had to offer. There was no rushing, everyone waited for everyone to get their fill before moving on. I had an amazing time. I love fish and over sized aquariums. I have been a half a dozen times. Most of my enjoyment came from watching them experience it for the first time. Well worth the time and money.",3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1U2R9QJ,3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1U2R9QJ
