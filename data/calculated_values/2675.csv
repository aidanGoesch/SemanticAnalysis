This is really significant for so many reasons.  For one, I haven't seen him in almost a year.  Our kids haven't seen him since last July.  He missed our first daughter's 2nd and 3rd birthdays and almost missed our second daughter's first birthday.  We have been alone and struggling for a year now after his unexpected departure so this is a huge deal.  I spoke to his counselor yesterday because we were unsure of when he was going to be paroled and coming home.  His maximum release date was at the very end of November so I thought it was going to be then, but suddenly I was told yesterday he will be home on August 1st.  I am so very nervous and distraught about it.  It's a weird combination of excited and scared and curious and worried.  I feel like he is a stranger to me now.  I haven't seen him in so long and I don't know how to feel about it.  It will be so different to have a partner again.  I have been on my own, doing everything myself for the entire year that I've gotten used to being alone all the time and raising the kids by myself.  It is going to be a really big change for both of us and I'm feeling so overwhelmed abou tit.",3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1UQYQ9J,3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1UQYQ9J
