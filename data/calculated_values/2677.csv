It was happened in my office. I worked as a team leader at that time. Two projects were given to my team and another one.  Our boss informed that the team which completes the project sooner will get a surprise. Later we came to know that it was a promotion. It will be given to the team leader who completes the work on time. That made us to work even faster. I got entire support from my team. Due to that we completed the work before the dead line.  We submitted the work to our boss before the other team. Our boss got impressed by our work. Due to that I was nominated for the promotion. In the next few days I was given promotion by our boss. It was the most memorable incident till now.,,3F6HPJW4JEMFM8Z4B7WORA19K43W29
