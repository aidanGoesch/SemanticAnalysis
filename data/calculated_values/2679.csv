We are living our dream. Just 2 months ago, we were ""homeless"" but not in the way you'd think.  My husband and I bought a house in 2017 in a brand new city, a small town in Tennessee. We loved our house.  It was plenty of space and had just about everything we wanted from a house. We welcomed our daughter in to the world in that house and our dog was the king of the backyard.  We planned on living in this house for at least 5 years but boy oh boy did plans change just 4 months ago.  After only 2 years of living in our first house together, we made the decision that we really wanted to be able to travel more.  To most, it seems like a pretty crazy idea for 2 young adults with a 2 year old and a baby due in December but we never really went with the norm of society to say the least. So after just a week of discussions, we contacted a realtor and put our house on the market.  Not even 12 hours on the market, we received an offer on our house. We instantly knew that that was the sign we needed to go on with our plan. We were moving into an RV and traveling. Well, traveling as soon as baby #2 was born. We went out and searched for our perfect RV and found our new home after many visits to the RV dealerships.  My husband insisted on it custom built so we had to wait 8 weeks for them to build it. The process of selling our house flew by and we were left homeless and RVless for a short time. It was well worth the wait.  We have now lived fulltime in an RV for 2 months and we are both so happy with our decision. I still can't believe how smooth and quickly we made this decision. We don't ever plan to live in a house again and plan to travel as long as possible.",,3F6HPJW4JEMFM8Z4B7WORA19WWQ2WY
