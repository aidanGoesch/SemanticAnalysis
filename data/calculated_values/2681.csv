Specifically, I am referring to the time we actually professed our love for each other. It was a rather special moment because we had been playing the game together for several weeks and she had been chasing me pretty hard during that time. I'm kind of a celebrity in that game, and a bit of a ladies' man, so she really wanted to pin me down! I know this sounds ridiculous, but gamers are very strange and weird! It was a powerful time, because I'm an average looking guy (though I'm at the top of the pack in this game we both played) and she is a beautiful woman. I guess that's ""hypergamy"" at work! It almost felt like I was winning the lottery and ""too good to be true"", even though I would never admit to that since you have to play it cool and casual! I thought she was playing me for some sort of benefit in the video game, but the more we grew close to each other the more I realized how organic it was. Finally my paranoia began to shed and the event happened. ""I might be falling in love with you,"" she said. ""I'm thinking the same thing,"" I said. Later that night, when we said goodbye, it was a much more formal ""I love you"" exchange; I think we were both anticipating that moment, as it's a milestone of any relationship. I still remember all the matches we played that day, as well as the specifics of 99 percent of the Skype conversation (and subsequent voice chat). I won't get into the naughty details, but the entire day and night were burned into my memory. It was an important and genuine moment for both of us. Even though our relationship has since failed due to distance and drama, I still look back fondly and with no regrets.",,3FDJT1UU75UGQ5OA4CFJ16AQTWZ5KR
