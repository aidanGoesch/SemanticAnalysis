Household chores is nothing compared to the job I had to do some months ago. When my sister landed a big contract job I was nervous. Not only was it crucial to do a good job, show confidence, and understanding, I also had to step out of my comfort zone and interact with strangers. The job was a week long task on a local military base. Working on a military base meant being on one's best behavior and being respectful. Both were easy for me to do; no problem. The hardest task was walking long hallways in 3 buildings and cleaning just about every bunk in each. All the toilets and showers needed to be spotless. All the rooms needed to be dustless. The vanity mirrors had to be smear free. Oh, the vanity mirrors! The major who inspected our work would always look hard at the vanity mirrors. If he found one smug or imperfection we had to go back and clean it. All three buildings had three floors. Walking up and down stairs was exhausting. I almost always ended up working on the third or second floor. I tried to avoid descending and ascending the staircase as much as possible because most of the time I was carrying something work related. I tried to move as fast as the other workers, but I ended up falling behind. It was the kind of work that I just was not used to. And when it was all over I hoped to never have to do it again.",3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGSNZPO2,
