It has been a struggle to provide for the kids, also being a woman, fair pay is so out the window, but I am proud to say  that 4 months ago I managed to buy a new car. Since this is a diary I can vent without bothering the friends who have put up with me over these years. After the divorce I found myself juggling , well, everything. I managed to find a part time job and vowed to use that money for a car. Yes it took 6 years, but everything is a learning experience in life; don't you think? I would like to pat myself on the back and say I did it all by myself. That would be a lie. Although I have done the work , the planning, the negotiating (mostly with the kids), the financing and all that goes with it by myself, I have friends and family.  These people have been there for me to babysit, to drag me out for a drink or just sit with me and provide a shoulder to cry on, or even better a great big much needed , laugh! I do have to say I am proud of myself. I also might mention it was no easy feat. The bottom line is that women will always work harder for less, until we (women) stop bringing up our boys with the idea that they are kings (I know it is hard but these boys grow to men and control us; oops off script;). I will say that I feel so very happy to have accomplished this. Pride is not a terrible thing if it is a motivator for triumph!",,3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGV5ZOP4
