It isn't technically new, it's used, but it is still new to me. I haven't had my own car in so many years that I forgot how good it felt to own one. I was struggling pretty badly financially-wise these past couple of years as most of my focus is on my son and what he needs, but I decided some months ago that it was time to start saving up money for this big purchase. I spent countless weeks researching the best options in regards to safety, reliability, and price and I finally figured out what I really wanted to choose. I also read reviews on different dealerships as my credit is not quite the best so I had to make sure I went to a place that could qualify me without too much of a hassle. After I had found the right place, I planned a day to go down and search for a car that fit my criteria. Surprisingly, I was able to find a car right away. I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with it. After we got back to the lot, I made sure I asked all the right questions so I would not have any surprises (particularly bad ones) down the road. When doing the paperwork to buy the car, my payments were not actually as high as I thought they would be, as my down payment was a good enough amount to keep me in a reasonable range. I kept getting those excited butterflies in my stomach and could not wait to get the keys to this car. I could not wait to drive my son around and tell him that mommy got this all on her own and I was so proud of myself and I hope that one day he would be proud of me as well. I feel as though we sacrifice a lot as parents and sometimes our needs get put on the back-burner; but sometimes we do need to put our needs first to better care for our children. I will never forget that day.",,3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGV5ZOP4
