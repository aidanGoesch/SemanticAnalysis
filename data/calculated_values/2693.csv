I try to do as much as possible for him because we are the only two employees and are stretched very thin at work.  He lacks common empathy and decency and despite this I try my best to keep positive and help as much as possible. I will clean up after him and try  to maintain a good working relationship with him. The incident occured when I had told him I could work a morning shift to allow him to have the day off to spend time with his son the only thing I asked was to get off a bit early so I can get some rest for the morning shift I now had to work. The same day I had done all of the pre-shift prep and spent hours organizing our inventory as well as making lists of daily tasks for our employees. I spent the rest of the day, working my normal shift which includes cleaning up his messes. Nearing the two and a half hour mark before the end of shift I asked to leave and he made me stay implying that I had done very little to no work. While this was very frustrating I remained at work until 10 minutes before close when he finally let me go home ""early"". He did this on purpose to flex his muscle and stroke his own ego. I felt and still feel very disrespected and wanted desperately to quit my job because of this incident. I continue to deal with this level of disrespect on a daily basis. Sometimes my contempt for him makes me want to seek revenge but I can't directly impact someone's life negatively. I am actively seeking another job. I hope the best for him but I can't continue to work in this environment. I hope something comes along soon that I can happily work in peace by myself. He, nor the owner, deserves an employee as competent and professional as me. I hope for the next person to take my position the climate changes at work.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNO6Q2QD
