All five of us, were ready for the storm. Had flashlights, food, had put plywood on all the windows. We thought we were prepared but nothing can prepare you for what happened. As the winds started to pick up we still had power for a little while. Once the power was gone, we could hear the winds getting stronger. We were all playing cards using candles for light in the living room. As the winds got stronger it was getting harder and harder to concentrate. The plywood started to fly away and all of a sudden an object came flying through one of the windows. We all ran to our safe room, the bathroom had only a small window so it was the safest room. All five of us were sitting in there listening to the outside noises and the radio. The noises quieted down but the radio warned us to stay indoors that it was the eye of the storm.  Sure enough minutes later the loud noises started again.  We were in that bathroom for what felt like an eternity, it was by far one of the scariest days of my life. Thanks to that battery radio we were able to know when it was ""safe"" to walk out. By the time we walked out of the bathroom my house was gone. All the windows had shattered and everything was flooded. That day we lost all of our material possessions but we were incredible grateful for been able to survive that ordeal.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNWDBQ28
