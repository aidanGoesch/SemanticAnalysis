I stayed with a family for three months. I visited all of Japan. I had a great time in the great land. I had the best sushi one day. It had crab, shrimp, and lobster meat on it. I hope I can find this type of sushi in the states. I visited many parks. I saw a lot of pretty trees. They were blossom tress and are the most beautiful trees in the world. I also visited some museums. I got to see some great armor and samurai swords. It was neat looking at history. There were some plays I visited. I also visited some sumo matches. I can't believe they can move while being that fat.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNWES2Q3
