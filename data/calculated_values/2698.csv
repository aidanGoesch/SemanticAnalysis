Not only am I nerdy, I'm clumsy. I'm scared to go out sometimes. If a girl would walk up to me I'd be scared to death. Why, would I get scared? Well, I'd never been with a woman in my life. About a month ago I met this nice woman. I thought nothing about speaking to her. I thought we were just friends. Well, I started feeling more warm to her. I thought she felt the same. I expressed a little bit of words explaining that I like her a lot. She actually liked me back. I proceeded to get more comfortable with this woman. I finally got brave, I kissed her! She acted as though she liked the kiss too. I was so excited and will never forget this.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNX9Y2Q0
