It happened at a week-long festivity called Sirius Rising, located on the campgrounds of Brushwood Folklore Center in Sherman, NY.  The kiss we shared happened without warning and struck a special chord in my heart as well as my mind.  The moment we kissed unfolded Thursday night, while I was waiting for a concert to start.  Earlier in the day, I attended a mystical workshop at the Sirius Rising event led by a kind middle-aged lady in a electric wheelchair.  I got to meet this lady and know a little bit about her as well as her profession during this workshop.  As I was waiting for the concert hosted by a world-famous juggler to start, I met the middle-aged lady again and she set up a seat next to me.  After we exchanged a few pleasantries, my mind went into overdrive as I noticed she was leaning in for a kiss.  The moment I noticed she was leaning in for a kiss, I did not hesitate; I immediately leaned over and gave her the most tender kiss I could possibly give her.  Instinct took over in that moment; 2 seconds seemed like 10, my thoughts no longer required any form of concentration, and I revealed my true character to her without blemish.  The kiss we shared was exciting and invigorating.  Although I had never kissed a woman before, the experience reached out to me in ways I did not think it could reach.  I never believe something as soft as a kiss could get past my hardened heart and mind, but it did in a way that was pleasent.  When our lips left, I did not feel any sort of negative emotions as we continued to talk to each other about a variety of topics that are best kept to myself.  The kiss we shared is truly unique, and because it was my first kiss, I doubt it will ever happen again, which is why I will cherish the experience forever.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNX9Y2Q0
