I remember having trouble sleeping the night before because I was so nervous about how I would perform, so when I woke up with only 5 hours of sleep, I felt like I was already setting myself up to fail. I was told over and over by my coaches and parents that this was just a competition and there was no shame in losing because at least I'd be learning something, however it was to no avail. I am very competitive, so it didn't really click in my head. When I got to the venue where it was being held, I felt like time was moving too fast, and soon I'd have to compete. I couldn't stop fidgeting. Eventually, it was finally my turn to compete. When I won my first match, I felt on top of the world. Then, I won another, and it felt even better. The momentum I started to build during my matches that day helped me build the confidence I needed to win my final match for that day. Sure enough, I did it. I was so ecstatic but I tried to remain calm so I didn't disrespect my opponent by celebrating. I hugged my parents and coaches and all of my teammates. It was only a white belt level competition, but I was still proud. It showed how hard I'd been working.",3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZW52QJ,
