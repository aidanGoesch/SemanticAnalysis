I ended up getting a call from my best friend, asking me if I could watch his son while he and his wife went out for a date night. I love that kid like he was my own, so I was happy to accept. Another plus, is that I get snacks and dinner for doing it. It's a win win. I didn't think to check the weather, as it seemed promising all that day. As soon as the kid and I were alone, however, it started to rain. And then the rumbling thunder accompanied by frequent flashes of lightning. To make it better, the storm cell was right over our town, so we got to hear it from right underneath. I hate storms, and have an irrational fear of them. I put on my best brave face, but I think flinching every time I saw lightening, or heard thunder gave me away. The kid, awesome as he is, had me sit down with him, and told me that playing games helps take your mind off of things you're scared of. Responding without thinking, I told him it was good advice. He just gave me a look, and said that I told him that all of the time when he's scared. I almost wanted to manly cry, I was so flattered. I ended up laughing, instead, thankfully. He then told me that even when I was an old man in a thunder storm, he'd always be there to play games with me. Like I said, I love this kid like he were my own, and I'm thankful that he thinks of me as family, and we'll always be in each others' lives.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZWRQ2T
