That's why when my best friend had her first baby, I loved that kid almost like he was my own. I babysit him every now and then, but my favorite moment with him (he was about 1 and a half years old at the time) was when I babysat him during this big thunderstorm. We'd had a huge round of storms hit our little town earlier in the month, with crazy amounts of damage, so it was a bit scary for everyone when we had this mild storm front move through. My friend and her fiance were both working, so it was just me and the baby alone in my friend's apartment when it hit. Thunder was shaking the building, rain was coming down in sheets, and there was even a moment we had some hail and a branch flew into the window. As you would probably expect, I was frightened and a little insecure. However, the baby was curious (as most kids his age are) and wanted to see what was going on outside. He kept trying to pull on the back door handle (baby-proofed, thankfully), and throwing toys at the window. It was just innocent curiosity and wonder for something that looked objectively awesome to someone so young. So, in perhaps a mildly reckless manner (although I did keep a good hold of him), I picked up the little man and opened the door to the back patio for him to see. Then, he sprouted his first word that I'd ever heard from him, ""Wow!"" In that moment, with one hand stretching out into the rain, and the other clutching tightly to my necklace, I didn't feel scared anymore. I felt warm, and happy for the gift this world had given me that I got to hold in my arms. Reflecting back, I guess that was the first time I could genuinely see his future stretching out in front of him; and, more importantly, my place in that future. I hope, that by the time he's old enough not to remember that storm, I can still encourage him to follow that curiosity and see all the wonder the world has to offer.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZWRQ2T
