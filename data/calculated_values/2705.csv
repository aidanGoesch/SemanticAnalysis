Like... Okay, you know how in movies someone will stub their toe and knock open a hidden wall panel? Then they check the wall panel and, gosh darn it, there's the map to old man Henderson's treasure? That wall panel was my life five months back. The stubbed toe? Well that was my financial situation.Do you know what a balloon payment is? Apparently it's when your mortgage payment shoots up suddenly. I didn't know that was a thing. My bank account didn't know either. Now, normally I would have just worked overtime, picked up an extra shift, something like that. But thanks to the car accident and the broken legs, that wasn't really an option. I looked through every option that WAS an option, poured through them really but between the medical bills, the sudden mortgage bump and the price to fix the vehicle... At the end of the day I only had one choice left to me, file for bankruptcy.Ouch, right? When I first considered it, my mind jumped right to the negative. 'What will my family think?' 'People are going to mock me.' That sort of stuff. You hear about corporations having to go through it all the time, but when it's you... Well, when it's was ME, that was a whole other world. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to suffer all the looks and the glances and the questions about rather that meant I was going to be homeless now or if I needed money for food. Just like the stubbed toe though, I didn't really get a choice in the matter. It's kind of funny though, because looking back on it, it really wasn't that bad. I got my life back under control and the embarrassment, light as it was, only hardened my resolve to get control back in my own hands. It's been five months since I kicked open that wall and not only have I found Mr. Henderson's metaphorical map, I've dug up his metaphorical treasure, sold it off on the metaphorical market and invested that money in my metaphorical savings account. I've never felt more in control or competent when managing my finances.",,3FFJ6VRIL2AQP3CL73OV7VZMBOP0IF
