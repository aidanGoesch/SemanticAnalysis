I had a baby girl. This day was so special to me as a mother. I have had other children. But this one was special. I have 5 boys. This time I had a girl. Someone who could be just like me. We could shop together. We could bake together. Even around the holidays we can make the guys some cookies. I could brush her hair. I could put dresses on her too. Most mothers I think would want to have atleast one daughter to enjoy. I love my daugher and I'm glad she came into my life 5 months ago.  Now off to bake and let her enjoy the smells of my kitchen.",,3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN21GHPFE
