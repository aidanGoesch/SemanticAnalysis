This was during a family get together. All of their relatives were there. I introduced myself to everyone there. No one was very interested in meeting me. I tried to engage with everyone. It still had no affect. I received all kind of funny and bad look from people during dinner. I would try to talk to people about their interest. They all showed no interest in all in talking to me. I asked my girlfriend's sister to take some pictures of us outside. After she took the pictures of us, I reviewed them. Some part of my body was cut out of every picture she took.  The whole experience left me feeling confused and alone. I asked my girlfriend about all of this when we left. She said that she had no idea any of these things happened.",3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9M3SLGG5,
