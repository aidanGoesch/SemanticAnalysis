Not me by far. I thought we could go on a vacation trip because we are always working you know. This really sucks the life right out of me. That is my brother that has been there for me from the jump. This right here is going to take some time before I can recover from this. I have to question all that I know now and it hurts to do this. I love this guy because he was there when no one was there. I have to remain strong for his family but it is going to be a stretched. I have to work hard at this. Father I promise that I will make sure they are good. I wont give up on them or myself.. Give me the strength during this time. I cannot deal with this right now.",3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9MS2LGGE,
