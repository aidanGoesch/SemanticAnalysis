We knew each other since high school and i thought that we would never separate. Unfortunately, they passed away due to drunk driving. They drove into a intersection with high speed and hit a pole. His body was ejected immediately on impact  his family was stunned by the news as they should. I was studying when I found out the news. It was disturbing to say the least because I knew him personally. Everyone in our circle was devastated. We thought to ourselves that is only we were there we could have prevented it from happening. It took us a while to understand that i was out of our control. We miss him greatly though. Kind person and ver fun to be with. We have to stick together for his family . This will be a rocky road ahead. We as a family will remain close. This is what he would've wanted.",3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9MS2LGGE,3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9MS2LGGE
