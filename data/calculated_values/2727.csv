But that night, I was hungry. I was happy to see my man. However, I needed food. We set out to find something to eat. We had to drive a long distance between each place. They were all closed. So we would proceed even further. I was so hungry, and tired. Eventually, we saw someone and asked. They told us there was a waffle house. The place was all the way across town. However, we got to it. We settled in and ordered food. I have never eaten so fast before. I really enjoyed the meal, and was happy to be with my boyfriend again. We had not met for a  long time, and we missed each other.",,3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9MTW5GGN
