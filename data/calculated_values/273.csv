That I was worth it for him. He told me that I made him happy and that he could talk to me in ways that he's never been able to talk with another person before. I was so happy to have meant something to this person the way that he told me I did. I wanted to take things slow with him, my heart was already ripped up and starting to heal. I knew that my heart was filling up with him completely. We used to stay up late and just talk to each other until we fell asleep. I slept better at night. I hoped that he did, too. One night after we spent time talking like we did, he asked me to be his girlfriend. I asked him if he was formally asking and not just joking. He said he was. I said yes. Not even two weeks later he broke up with me. Because we both had other things to take care of. There was suddenly no room for me in his life. I'm still broken up about it. I still hurt. It hurts right now. Why promise me these things and then take them away? What did I do. Did I do wrong? He says I didn't. I don't believe him. I don't hate him.",,323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLBHDYFH4
