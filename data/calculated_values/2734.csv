A big family vacation a barbeque, over night stay and out of town trip to six flags, and I had a blast the night before me, my mom, sisters and brother packed our bags to stay the night over my cousin house in Goodlettsville ,Tennessee. She had the biggest house ever I thought it was a mansion; six bedrooms two an half bath, a swimming pool, a game/movie room with a nice big kitchen. It was something that I was not use, knowing that we stayed in a three bedroom based on an income apartment on the East side of Nashville. Arriving to my cousin house i seen alot of my family members even the ones that was from out of town. We greeted eachother and we went on about our business. As my grandmother, mom, and aunts prepared the food for the barbeque. The other adult gathered around different tables playing cards, dominos, shooting dice, and watching movies or sports on TV. I remember me my siblings and cousins played outside from swimming, sports, danced and hide go seek anything that you could think of for children to do. When the food was ready we gathered together and said prey and feast. After dinner was served everyone went to movie room for family time. We watched a movie called Madea's Family Renion by Tyler Perry. The Movie reminded me so much of my family. It let me know that family is everything and no family is perfect. We just have to learn to stick together thru good timeShe had the biggest house ever I thought it was a mansion; six bedrooms two an half bath, a swimming pool, a game/movie room with a nice big kitchen.
