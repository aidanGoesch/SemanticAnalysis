She is autistic with some speech delay, so school is sometimes a struggle for her. I appreciated being able to take part in the celebration of her hard work. The children demonstrated some of their new skills through songs and presentations. I was especially impressed when my child walked right up to a microphone to tell the audience about learning her shapes. At the beginning of the year, she could barely hold still on stage and needed a teacher to help her. She would have been scared to talk in front of people. I was very proud of this new development. After the kids did their presentations, the families ate potluck food. My daughter wanted to eat lots of watermelon. I helped both my kids get plates, and we sat down to eat. Then my kids were running around and playing with other kids. I was impressed to see them demonstrating social skills. My son especially has struggled to play with other kids, so I was happy to see it that night. After that, we went home.",3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNEXY3VL,
