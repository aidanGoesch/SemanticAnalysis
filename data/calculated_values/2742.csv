It was old and messy. Hard to believe anyone lived there. One day while on a walk they saw a small kitten walking down the sidewalk from the old house. They thought the cat was adorable. It was clearly scared and very dirty. It looked small and malnourished. Over the next few weeks they returned to the house daily to try and befriend this kitten. To their surprise they met a new cat almost daily. After awhile they realized that not only did this house contain the one small kitten, but at least 100 other cats. They decided to call animal services, who came and took all the cats. Kim and Mary both created a group online looking for homes and volunteered at a local shelter to help socialize and nurse all the cats back to health. This was encouraging, and also heartbreaking. Many of the animals had medical issues or injuries. It was hard to image someone could be so awful to such innocent animals for both Kim and Mary. After several months of hard work, Kim and Mary saw every single cat in a loving home. It was a great experience for both sisters, who now work at the shelter full time.",,3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNJKL3VN
