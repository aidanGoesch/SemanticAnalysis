She immediately captured them, and we began the process of researching and determining how to socialize them. This was not easy, but it was easier than the marketing and adoption! As my sister began to work with the babies to help them be more comfortable with her, I began looking for TNR programs for the parents, and low cost vet care for the whole crew. Luckily, we were able to find the vet care at a very reasonable price and all the babies as well as their feral parents were taken care of. This was no small feat, as going to our vet would have cost probably about 2,100 dollars for the seven cats.  Then came adoption time. I began researching this and acting on it early. We did adoption photo shoots for some adorable baby photos. Thsi was no easy task, sine the babies were still partially feral, and my sister's home is very dark. (So we could not move them to light or bring in lighting). With the adorable pictures in hand, my son, my sister and I began writing biographies. We designed fliers, made and Instagram, made a Twitter. I made an adoption application and set it up so it would be easy for my sister to weed through the results and find good families. We reached out to everyone we knew. We marketed, we shared, we posted to craigslist. This final step was our fatal error. The terrible pet owners who came out of the woodwork on craigslist hurt our hearts and paralyzed us. Finally, I reached out to a woman I met the previous year (ironically enough, when I bought some ice skates from her on craigslist) who used to run a kitten rescue. She arranged for two of the kittens to be adopted out through the rescue. This was the best choice since the rescue in question vetted heavily, more heavily than we as individuals could.  The babies found a home - together - after attending their first adoption event. It was heartbreaking to ""give up"" and not be responsible for finding their homes, but it was the best we could do. We were not emotionally prepared for vetting the adopters.",3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNJKL3VN,
