I've always loved cats since I was a kid but never had one. This wasn't the first time I attempted to rescue a kitten. At first I was a little weary because I thought the kitten would be scared of me. To my surprise she ran right to me and let me pick her up. I brought her into my house and she was really tame, she just seemed hungry. At first I was going to take her to a shelter the next morning. There's a animal shelter right near my house so I thought it would be better if I just took her there. Then I thought about all of the animals that are already in the shelter. I thought they might have trouble finding her a home because she was a black cat. The next morning I decided to keep the cat. I went out and bought everything she needed to make her happy. Food, litter box, and toys. I didn't regret the decision and I still don't. She is now a sweet affection cat.",3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNL1C3VE,
