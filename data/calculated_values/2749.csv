This happened on July 20, 2019 when my son and daughter-in-law got married. It was somewhat of a stressful and emotional day beginning at six in the morning. We were excited and yet nervous for the unknown. The weather was beautiful, but I still felt scared. My husband had to drive my daughter and other son who were both in the wedding to the hotel so that they could join the wedding party for pictures. I texted my son and my future daughter-in-law to congratulate them and to remind them of the special day that lies ahead. The rest of us not in the wedding began to prepare. I went to the hairdresser came back around noon. I quickly ate something because I knew it would be a long day. Additionally, I had to bring the wedding license. This little piece of paper seemed like a huge burden to carry and to remember. We called for the Uber and piled in the car. The wedding venue was a gorgeous hotel. We found the room, but we just sat and waited for everything to unfold. The wedding started about 30 minutes late which didn't help to calm me. Finally, it is time. My husband and escort my son down the aisle. I tear up and feel very sad. He will no longer be just ours; we have to share him with his wife and new family. The bride appears looking lovely and the two become one. We rejoice and cheer, but still feel tearful. We move on the party and celebration. I am happy but still sad thinking will they successfully merge their two lives together. We eat, drink, dance and wish the happy couple well. The party is over and we go back to our ordinary lives.",3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNM273VC,
