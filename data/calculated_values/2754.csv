A girl who I'd once considered my good friend but who I now considered more of a nuisance started messaging me asking if I could get her opiates. I tried to ignore her at first.  I told her I was busy. She had her boyfriend start messaging my boyfriend. Eventually, I agreed to go.  She had been taking xanax and drinking. I was so mad at what I felt was her pressuring me. The next night, I got a message from a friend informing me she had died from an overdose. I knew  that I could potentially be facing a second degree murder chargeMymother called me one day to inform me the police had been by her house but that they only wanted to know if i knew her cell phone code. That her father had mentioned my name as a possible source who might know. I called her boyfriend and asked him to come over. His words were almost exactly the same as the police. Her father probably provided my name. I asked him if they'd asked him about me And he told me yes, a couple wks before. He moved out of state a couple if weeks later and the police called me for a meeting the same day. I met and tasked with the inspector who, oddly enough, was named John Holmes. Ultimately, I wasn't in any legal troublebut it was a transformative experience.  I felt a mixture of relief, guilt, sorrow for her twin brother and parents loss. Pissed at her for putting me in that position, glad I had said no and was not in trouble. Recognition of my ownluck and realization that if I wasn't a whitefemale from a middle class background, things could have been much different.",,3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNVZW3V4
