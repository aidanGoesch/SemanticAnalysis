I decided that I wanted to go somewhere warmer for school. I decided that I wanted to move to Los Angeles. I pack up all my bags, and flew over there. The thing is I didn't have a plan. I got an apartment, and tried to find a job right away, because of course LA isn't cheap. I couldn't find one. Before I knew it It was the end of the month, and I didn't have enough money to afford my apartment. I freaked out, and I ended up getting evicted from my apartement. I didn't have enough money to get home, so I had to ask my friend to pay for a $1000 flight home. It was absolutely embarrassing. I had failed at the one thing I wanted to, and I got a lot of flac for it back home. But I did learn different lessons while I was there. I learned never to move without a plan, and to move where I can afford. There doesn't need to be a rush for certain things. People are in different places in their life.",,3FQ5JJ512MAKGUUG8CB5VNACKHINKI
