I was induced on the day he was due as planned at my prenatal visit. I was very happy to see my baby boy that day. When I went to the hospital they took me inside right at the time of my appointment. After doing some paperwork and initial checkups I was given medication for induction. After a couple of hours suddenly I heard my baby's heartbeat dropped and I was trying to reach the nurse by pressing on the alarm. At the same time I saw a few nurses and doctors running into my room and yelling ""baby's heartbeat dropped"". I got really stressed out and I could not believe what was happening. It was very much unexpected. They got me to relax my body on my hands and knees and they gave me several shots. But still they could not get the baby to get back to normal. They they decided they have to do a c-section on me and get the baby out right away. Next they took me to the operating room. All I saw was so many heads staring at me and acting stressed out. In the operating room they gave me the anesthetic shots to my back without even numbing the area. It was severely painful like electric currents running down my leg. They they inserted a tube into my genitals and gave me more shots on my arm. At this point I was losing hope of seeing my baby boy alive. I felt so helpless and scared. Tears ran down my cheeks. All of sudden they they yelled ""Looks like he's picking up"" and I was much relieved. I just felt like I woke up from a horrible dream. Everybody was so relieved and happy that he was recovered without having to do a c-section delivery. When they took me back to the room I saw my husband was crying. I just gave him a long hug and said ""God bless him!.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9N2Z29WT
