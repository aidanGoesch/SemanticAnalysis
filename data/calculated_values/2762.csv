Great Aunt Sally turned 100 years old.  What an amazing milestone.  We had a fabulous birthday party for her on the Queen Mary ship in Long Beach.  It was so much fun.  We had a huge turnout with more than 150 people coming.  All 12 of her children, their spouses and their children were able to be there!  We rented the ballroom and had the party catered with an amazing array of foods.  There were so many people I hadn't seen in such a long time there.  My favorite part was when all of her grandchildren got together and performed a musical that they had been working on for 2 months.  They were amazing!  It was filmed and I know it's just going to be a huge hit on the internet.  We all made plans to get together 6 months from now.  We'll have to find a local park that will be able to accommodate all of us, lol.  It was such a wonderful day and I'm so happy I got to be a part of it.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NT3FW9S
