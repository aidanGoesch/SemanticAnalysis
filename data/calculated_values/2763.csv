My close and immediate family is relatively small compared to most people.  I only have  two pairs of aunts and uncles with 6 total cousins (although 3 of them are married), and 5 little nieces/nephews who are all under 8 years old that I see on a regular basis, even on holidays.  My father's side of the family is not in our lives, so gatherings are usually small and more personal and intimate.  So in other words, it's a tight knit family and my great Aunt is basically the ""matriarch"" of the family. The event was a simple party where we rented out a room for everyone in a nice Italian restaurant.  Almost everyone was there with the exception of my brother who was working and my cousin and his wife and kids who are currently living in DC.  There was also a few close family friends like my late Uncle's boyfriend as well to celebrate with us. What made the event/party so special and memorable is not just that my Aunt is now 100, it's how in relatively good health she still is in!  Aside from not being able to drive anymore, she is still able to live on her own and take care of herself without needing any sort of assisted living.  She is still as sharp as ever mentally and is probably the most wholesome and nicest person that I have ever met!  One of the things that she did was dig up some really old photos of everyone from when they were kids and passed them around after dinner.  Even though I looked goofy younger, it was still a really touching moment because she had photos of everyone there from when they were kids.  She really has been through and seen a lot and it's incredible that she is still going strong.  I'm not usually a big fan of family gatherings since I do not have very much in common with most of my family, but this event was one I was really happy to be a part of.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NT3FW9S
