Nothing was making me happy. I tried to control and get myself in a positive mood. Nothing I did could shake me from the way I was feeling. I decided to try to live a little so I placed a large bet on a basketball game. I thought that it was a for sure thing. I was almost certain that I wouldn't lose. But the cards just didn't have it in for me and I lost it all. I didn't realize then but it came to me later when thinking about the events that I had a gambling problem. I decided to get some help after that. I was able to get the help that I needed and I've stopped gambling since then. I'm actually pretty happy now. I know I'm doing the right thing. I know I'm not being weak anymore. I have my strength back again.,,3FTOP5WARGAMKEWRPL9VJWEMMEJ0JG
