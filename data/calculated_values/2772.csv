For months now, my husband has not been interested in sex. He's also been more irritable than normal. I thought maybe I had done something to irritate him and he wasn't able or willing to tell me about it. I tried talking to my girls friends about the situation and they didn't have anything useful to add. Well, Shelly did make an interesting comment that his behavior sounded like a character in a romance novel she was reading. I tried to get her to say more, but she seemed to regret the comment. Well, I had errands to run so after meeting with my friends, I stopped at Costco, Walmart, and Starbucks for some overpriced coffee. This all happened two weeks ago and my life will never be the same. Well, the errands ended up taking less than I expected. So I got home earlier than I'd told my husband I would. I parked in the driveway and started carrying in the groceries. My husband didn't bother to help carry them in which really annoyed me. But I held my tongue because I didn't want to lash out in anger. Once I finished putting everything away, I started walking to his man cave. He was yelling; I thought maybe he was playing a video game with friends. But as I rounded the corner, I saw him FaceTiming with a woman who was nursing a baby. That really freaked me out so I stopped to listen. After a few minutes of eavesdropping, it dawned on me that this child was his and that he had been cheating on me for nearly a year. Maybe longer. I was devastated and my life will never be the same.",,3FUI0JHJPYK7GSTZ5NZR5NV4UGZ33V
