We don't have any kids, although we have been trying off and on.  Somehow along the way, our lives get busy and we stop trying.  I thought we had a good relationship, until I found out he was cheating on me.  One night, his phone was turned on and I noticed he kept getting text messages.  I just glanced at one and saw that it had a photo attached.  I was curious so I looked at it.  It was his coworker sending him nudes!  I was shocked to say the least.  I confronted him and he denied it at first, but then he came clean.  I was so mad!  I kicked him out and he went to live with her.  I found out a week later that she was pregnant.  I couldn't believe it!  After years of us trying and he just gets her pregnant so soon into their relationship.  It physically made me sick... or so I thought.  It turns out it was morning sickness.  He got me pregnant, too!  I didn't even know if I wanted to tell him, but I did.  I guess it is his karma kicking in, having to take care of two babies.",,3FUI0JHJPYK7GSTZ5NZR5NV4UGZ33V
