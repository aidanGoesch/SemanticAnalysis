This friend I had known had a drinking problem for many years. I had made many attempts in the past to suggest help for him, but he refused. On this day my friend decided to drink and drive and crashed his car. This day was important to me because it was the day my friend hit rock bottom and decided to get help. On this day my friend went fishing and, unknown to me, he was drinking. I got the phone call from him that he had driven his car in a ditch and needed picked up because he could not get it out. I went to pick him up and we contacted another friend who had a truck and could possible pull his car out of this ditch. Because my friend had been drinking I went with the other friend to try to get the car out of the ditch. After a few hours and some help from some random strangers we were able to pull the car out. It did have damage but was still drivable. After many attempts of trying to convince my friend to get help, this was his breaking point and he realized he needed the help. I was relived that he decided to finally get help for himself. It has been a few weeks of sobriety now and I am very proud of my friend. It is not easy to get over an addiction and takes lots of hard work and dedication. I hope my friend can continue his sobriety.",,3G0WWMR1UW66RXSBLHV2R9ML82LQN7
