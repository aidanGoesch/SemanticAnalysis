He is a person that I truly admire. He will be truly missed.  I have been thinking about the special relationship that we had. I use to visit him when he lived in South Carolina.  He was a quiet and thoughtful man.   He loved his family dearly.  My mother had a special relationship with him.  I was able to stay some summers with him.  I am so grateful for that. I can remember when I was little he took me to my first movie.  It was Snoop come home.  It was just like it was yesterday.  I remember that he was retired but he keep a garden.  We would eat from the garden.  I remember happy time when I was in his present.  He was never mean to me.  He was always soft spoken and kind.  He took us to church every Sunday on my summer visit.  I remember at the end of the summer my grandmother and grandfather took me school shopping.  He bought my brother and I some really cool clothes.  When I think about my grandfather it will be of those quiet summer when he allow us to be free in his garden.  I now cherish those fun memories of him.,,3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J47SM678
