My family all took turns telling stories of what he had done in his life, and all his accomplishments. After the burial, we all got together for lunch and started to catch up with each other. There's no real way to start this story about my grandpa and his bravery. But, here's how it goes. In 2016, when I was 19, my grandfather was diagnosed with  lymphoma. He felt strong for this first fight. He gave his body up to tests and any medicines that would allow him to live longer. He won that fight. He finished it strong supported by my aunts, my uncles, and my grandma. About a year or 2 later, he was diagnosed with Leukemia. He, again, gave himself up to treatments and medication. He wanted to be with his family longer and no one believed that God was ready for him. He, like his strong self, won that battle. Of course, God wasn't done with this tough and brave soldier yet.",3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J47SM678,
