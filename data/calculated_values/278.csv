I genuinely want to change and I've managed to convince my loved ones that I've started the process but I'm no different from I was two weeks ago when I spilled beer in the empty house. I want to say that it's the beer that caused it but it's me. My behaviour has driven my wife and kids away. She took them to stay with her mother in California and I can't stay sober long enough to drive and go see them. I wasn't always this way but after I lost my job, I lost my purpose. I feel so cold and desolate all the time. Or at least, I felt. Even though I am no different, I have the hope that I can change. I've found religion and its my faith in its power that I've told my loved ones that I will change. So paradoxically, my lie was not at all insincere. When she left that morning two weeks ago, I went for comfort in what gave me misery in the first place. I took a case of beer from the basement and I drank and cried. It wasn't until my last beer that I looked into myself, drunk though I was, and realized that I must change. I went to the bookshelf and took up the only book I thought had power - power for me to overcome. I spilled my beer purposely while alone in the house. As I read the verses in John, I felt strength that I never had before and I stumbled to the sink to pour the beer out. I threw out my whole stash. I still have the desire but now I have hope.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DP4F70C
