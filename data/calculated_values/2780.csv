I was able to meet all of my extended family members at my grandfathers funeral and that was a bittersweet experience. Meeting my family under such mournful circumstances was not how I wanted things to go. We went through the viewing the day prior. The next day was the actual funeral where he was buried with military honors and laid to rest forever. My entire family was saddened at the loss of my grandfather. Each of his sons and daughters went up to the altar and gave a speech about their experiences with him. After the ceremony we all went out to have lunch at a nearby restaurant. things were nice, everyone was chatting and having fun. It was like nothing had ever happened. I spoke with my uncles and aunts about work and finding good jobs, then after the lunch we all went out to watch a movie. It was overall a great experience. We all had tons of fun. I would love to get together with my family again in the future.",3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J47SM678,3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J47SM678
