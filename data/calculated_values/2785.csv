We usually sit in Discord/Skype/whatever when we're home and free, so we talk a lot.  We made the decision to meet up a few months ago for the first time.  It was something else, very exciting, everyone made sure they could get the time off, and had spare money to blow on things etc.  We met up at Disney, we figured it was the best place since the transportation is free and there is a ton of things to do there.  We didn't care too much about the parks and what not, we all cared about just hanging out more.  We stayed at the Disney All-Star, and we got an adjoining room, keeping the door open so we had a lot of space. While we were there, we went to downtown disney and did a little people watching one day.  After that, we went to their bowling alley that had drinks/food/etc, we got a little tipsy and bowled for a few hours.  Following that, we headed back to the hotel to relax and play a board game (we ended up playing Codenames) while we talked.  The next day we went to the park, which ended up being Magic Kingdom, and we went on some rides.  We also got some food and drink there as well, then we hung around and watched the little parade they do.  We stayed a few hours after the park closed since hotel guests were able to do that and then we hit some of the bigger rides again (Splash Mountain and Space Mountain).  After that, we headed back to the hotel and rested again.  The final day we were there was just hanging around the hotel room/outdoor area and just taking it easy.  The following day we headed home and that was the story of one of my favorite trips ever.",3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J4ZBR768,
