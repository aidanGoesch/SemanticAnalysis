I had been talking to them for many, many years, and we all decided it was finally time to plan a meetup.  We all scheduled to meet up at Disney due to the logistical nature of getting everyone together without needing to drive everywhere.  It was quite odd to realize that I had organized something so big (there were about 8 of us.).  It truly felt great, like we had been able to forget the problems we had with the world for a few days.  We had first went to Disney Springs, which is basically a sprawling row of shops.  We got some cigars, went to a bar, went bowling, and all around just had a truly great day.  The second day of the trip we went to Magic Kingdom, which is a really big theme park.  We basically cared more about hanging out than the actual destination, but we did have some good food, and some good fun.  Third day, unfortunately was time for all of us to go back.  We have begun planning future vacations together ever since, I feel it's a major event. It's gotten many conversations going and still provides us entertainment remembering the goofy things that happened.  I think it was a milestone in my life, as short as the trip was, it showed me that it's ok to meet people, it's ok to let people into your life.  I think everyone should take a chance and meet up with people they talk to online, so long as they're able to do it safely.  I think the biggest most important thing of it all is that life is too short to not do something fun.",3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J4ZBR768,3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J4ZBR768
