It's always a fun time when they're over and usually my mother and I like taking them to go grab some quick grub from wherever they're feeling like to that day. We loaded up the guys and went on our way. As we were leaving I felt a bump under the rear tire but thought nothing of it as we live on a dirt road and there's always big rocks shifting and whatnot. We got their food and ice cream and headed back home so they could eat comfortably. When arrived to the house I saw now what I thought was a mere rock was in fact my cat, Patches. I quickly drove around it's body and helped bring the kids in because I didn't know how they would react. I was still in shock at this moment as I couldn't accept what I had done. I still can't get the image of her lifeless body just laying there. I did this, no one else but me. I was not careful enough and just kept on driving without checking if there was anything around. Of course both kids couldn't stay inside without curiosity getting the better of them and came outside as I had picked her up and moved here until I found a suitable place to bury her. They questioned what had happened and I am not one to make up stories/fantasies and told them what happened. I had this cat since before either of my niece and nephew were born. While she was getting old, she was still always full of life. To my surprise they told me that everything was going to be okay and that accidents happen. To believe such little human beings could comfort an adult in a sad time is amazing, and I am so thankful to have them in my life.",3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOX576VHS,3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOX576VHS
