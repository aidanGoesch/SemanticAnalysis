Although I was surrounded by a caring family, tragedy struck when I lots my mother at the age of three. I imagine being born into a family of three other siblings , including my twin brother, offered some comfort to this lost.  The ages of my brothers and sisters ranged from fifteen, thirteen and three. This created many challenges for my surviving parent, whose work commitments kept him away from home, often at night. It was decided that my twin brother and I would be split between relatives to relieve the stress created by my mothers absence. This, however difficult it is to imagine created for me a unique growing experience splitting my time between the city and the country. As I reflect on my situation growing up in this environment I realize that it offered me unique benefits, perhaps not experienced by other children growing up in more traditional arrangements. I have always had an outgoing personality and friendliness, generally attributed to a level of patience and flexibility in most social interactions I have with people, personally and professionally. This trait I know comes from leaning at an early age to adapt to change that comes unexpectedly. When my father re-married, I was ten and fell back on my experiences as a younger child to better adapt to yet another chapter in my family dynamic to unfold. Although, at this time I do remember some typical Pre-teen angst, that proved challenging for my father and step mother, my history proved yet again that patience and flexibility rewarded me with a loving and committed new mother whose example of strength and courage played a very important role in my formative years. I often think just how blessed I am to have had 2 mothers, a twin brother and such a loving and unique family dynamic growing up. The most endearing and lasting memories I have are of a transitional nature and not necessarily stability. Whats funny now is that I strive for routine or regularity in my life, whilst always prescribing a degree of patience and flexibility.",,3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOX586HVG
