We've adapted so easily, so readily, to this broken boundary of time and concentration. There's such a catastrophic downside to this concept that has taken over us. It is hard to believe that we bought into this concept so easily. But, we have. We now lack the ability to concentrate for a long duration; we're constantly dividing our time between ourselves, our needs, and others. We live a fragmented life. This realization came to me when I was listening to Radiohead. I was a bit disheartened when I came to this realization. I have however, vowed to commit myself to strengthening my concentration, and having more respect for my time. I have vowed not to spend my time according to others. I have vowed to use time accordingly. There will be exceptions to what I'm trying to accomplish, but I hope to live more according to how I have vowed to set out to live.  I only get to live this life once, so I must press forward in what is best for me. Time is of the essence, so I must be wise about my time and concentration.",,3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOXE1AVHT
