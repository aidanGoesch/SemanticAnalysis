Sellers have the upper hand, and let me tell you they know it! There were times when we wanted to throw in the towel and just walk away, there were times where we wondered whether we'd just be better off staying our new place, we even pondered moving to a new country! But let me tell you, when I get to walk into my new home, and see all the great things about it now it just puts a smile on my face and it somehow makes it all worth it. One of the most memorable moments of the whole process came on a sunny, Sunday afternoon a few months back. We came across this great house online that truly fit all of our needs. It seemed like it was just too good to be true, a house that checked all our boxes and within our budget was just too good to be true. We contacted our realtor right away and said we need to see this house now! She warned us not to get too ahead of ourselves as the house had been on the market for a more than a couple of weeks and surely had many offers waiting to be approved. Regardless we wanted to go see it. As we drove up to the house it was even more perfect than the pictures could show, the street, the colors, the neighbors, and trees surrounding it were all perfect! We saw cars in the driveway and figured it was just other potential buyers but as we walked in we were greeted with an elderly couple walking out of the house. They introduced themselves and said they were on their way out and told us to enjoy the house. My wife and I said they did not have to rush out and could even stay if they wanted. This turned out to be the best decision! They walked us through the house and showed us every little corner and what made it all so special. They showed such detail and we did the same when explaining why this house was so perfect for us. We connected on a different level and as we left the house we told them we'd be making an offer the next day. It was going just like we imagined until our realtor called us and told us our offer was the fifth highest of all offers received. She mentioned the buyers were reviewing them all but again, not for us to get our hopes up as we were down there as far as offers went. Not 10 minutes went by when my phone rings again, this time an unknown number. I answer and to my pleasant surprise on the other end was the elderly woman we met at the beautiful house the day before. She had a sound of joy on her voice and explained she wanted to be the one to give me the good news. She went on to tell me that they were so happy to be accepting their offer. The couple did not care about money in the end, all they wanted was the house to go to someone who would take care of it like they did, they saw themselves in us as we walked through the house and it would be their delight to be able to pass it onto us!",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531F7R3KGA
