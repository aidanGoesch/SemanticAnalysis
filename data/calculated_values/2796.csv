It was a long process, but totally worth it in the end. The first step was getting preapproved for a loan so we would know the price point of the home we were looking for. Then we found a realtor who asked us a lot of questions about what we were looking for.  We looked at a lot of houses online and in person.   Then we finally found a house that we really liked. We decided to put an offer in on it. At that point all we could do was wait. It was a stressful few days waiting to find out. Then we got the call that our offer had been accepted!! We were so excited. Even at this point there were so many steps to go through. Getting the mortgage company all of the paper work was a huge process. Then we barely ended up closing by the time we had to be out of our rental. Finally it was time to sign the closing paperwork. And then 2 days later we were able to pick up the keys and go to our new house!!! We were homeowners!",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531F7R3KGA,
