However, there are some limits to how far you can get with that cheap healthcare. The cancer treatments my uncle needed were just not available where we live. 12 Months ago, We had to go to the United States to seek better treatments for my uncle's cancer. We were very optimistic about my uncle getting the treatment that he needed in the United States. That optimism quickly faded however, once the costs were revealed to us. He does not have sufficient health insurance that would cover the cost in the United States, and there is no way the family can get that amount of money together for my uncle to pay for his treatments. 11 months ago, The option of a loan was there, but the amount of debt it would put the entire family in would weigh us down for the rest of our lifetime. 10 monts ago, my uncle made the decision to leave the United States untreated. He was very disappointed as we had all gotten our hopes up. Unfortunately it just was not meant to be. 8 months ago, my uncle made peace with his decision and very reflective about the life he had led. 6 months ago, the cancer spread to his brain and the rest of his body. He passed away 4 months ago. I wonder if my own financial situation would lead me to make a similar decision like he did?",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FA9BKGL
