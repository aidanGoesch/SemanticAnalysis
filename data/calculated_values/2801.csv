During college days, we used to hang out as  a friends, attending classes together, having lunch break and sometime even dropping and picking me up from Home to College and college to home. Day in, Day out we used to see each other , spent time together, talk and share things about our life, but when the cupid striked him, I had no idea. One day when we were in cafeteria, he proposed me. He said that he fall in love the first time he saw me and from their on, he decided that he will marry me, and no one else. It was a love at first sight for him, but it wasn't for me. I couldn't think beyond friendship, because my parents will never approve of him, since he is from different religion. I could not say ""yes"" because i was not sure. I walked away from cafeteria and went straight home. I thought a lot the whole day. And the next day i decided to end this friendship, so i told him the truth. He went completely crazy denying my rejection to marry him. I got scared and started to stay far away from him. He was heart broken and disappointed. He tried to talking to me and calling me at home, but i ignored him. So later, he decided to contact my best friend and his boyfriends, since we hanged out together few times. He convinced them and then they try to convince me that he really loves me a lot and he wants to marry me but then i told them it's not possible, due to our differences, my parents will never accept him. Then they said, if he doesn't marry me, he will die and they confronted me and i refused to listen to them. Then my friend told me that i am lucky that i have someone, who loves me so dearly and deeply, wish  i had that. Her comment made me think and then i decided to talk to him. I also bought this in front of my parents and they clearly said no. After all this chaotic situation, i finally decided to marry him, but without my parents consent. They got very angry and broke all the ties with me.  Even today they are not willing to accept me and my  marriage with a guy from different religion.",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FA9BKGL,
