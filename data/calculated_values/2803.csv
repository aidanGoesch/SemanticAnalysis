The first time was around 3 am and I had to use the bathroom, then another 30 minutes laying in bed thinking about everything. I dozed off and then around 6 am I just awoke worried about everything, school, tests, the semester, what my parents would think. After I laid  there another half hour I got up and had a cigarette and coffee and a cold bowl of cereal. I got dressed and went to my first class, Chemistry; I listened to the lecture and took notes, but they didn't really mean anything. I saw Phil between classes and he seemed happy and upbeat, I wish I had his drive and intelligence. After that I had Calculus and it just droned on, I don't feel like I belong here. I walked back home for lunch to make a sandwich, the apartment was trashed, the sink full of dishes and refrigerator empty. I got some bread out to make a ham sandwich and it was moldy so I just threw it in the trash and walked to McDonalds. Another Cheese Burger and small coke, it's all I can afford. I skipped my afternoon lectures and just stayed in my room watching YouTube video's on my phone and texting Anna, I think she wants out of this relationship. Maybe that would be best because she's not any more happy than I am. Now as I sit here writing this at my desk, thinking about dinner I really don't feel like leaving my room. I don't have the energy to go out and there's nothing here. I may just go home at the end of the semester and try something new.",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FJ5BGKI
