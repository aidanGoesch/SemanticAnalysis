I walked through my city and I went inside of my local Starbucks. I saw this fascinating woman ordering her coffee. I know nothing about her, I'm sure that we've never talked before. But for some reason she just looked so familiar. We were staring at each other through the shop. I scheduled my coffee trips around the same time that I thought she would be there. She seemed to have a routine which was not hard to follow. The more that I saw her the more that I felt this way for her. I could have the worst day at work or at home but just seeing her face gave me some optimism. Just by looking at her I felt happy, I felt that I could pull through the day just to get me back to that Starbucks. We started seeing each other so much that she just began saying hello to me. We would constantly greet each other but never had a conversation. I held the door for her a few times but never really spoke to her. I felt weird that I was in love with her yet we've never had a meaningful conversation. I don't know anything about her. I couldn't even figure out why I felt this way for her. After I accepted how I felt about her I began to feel better in my life and I felt that I could help people. We eventually had a conversation and she approached me. We had a decent relationship after that.",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FZ9UGKP
