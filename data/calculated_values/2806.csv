She was by herself and being quiet and cute. I as alone at a table looking through my work studies. I just happened to look up and there she was. She was just looking like the world's most angelic person. It was like someone made her for the purpose of making others happy. Now when I saw I fall in love with her, its not like we really fall in love. More like she made me smile and happy when I thought I wasn't able to. She allowed me to remember to find the joy in love and to share it. I took that as my pay it forward sign of the day. I knew I had to do my best to also make someone happy. I went outside and met people and smiled at them because of it. I was so happy and effected another person. that person was so happy they told. They said I made them day better and was grateful. I thought to myself, it all started when I fall in love with someone I did know.",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FZ9UGKP,
