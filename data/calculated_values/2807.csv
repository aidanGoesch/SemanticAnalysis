To love blindly and completely, what a beautiful concept. The other day I fall in love with a girl I’ll never know. She sat across from me at Starbucks, unknowingly stealing my breath away. Yes I’ll never see her again, but for that hour I was in love. And it is because of that I will continue to have a wonder day, hopefully paying it forward to an unknowing stranger needing a reason to smile. I wish I could have talked to her but I didnt. The man across from me noticed I was smiling so he said I had a pretty smile. That made me happy. I was hapy he saw my joy. I think because of that I was able to upleft others. I when and talked to my co worker about it late. He told me I was a good perosn. I was feeling positive about the interaction. But in my mind I was still hope to see her again. Maybe one day I wil. You never really now.",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FZ9UGKP,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FZ9UGKP
