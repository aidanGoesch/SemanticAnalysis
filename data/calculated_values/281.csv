He was 91 and an inspiration to me. I am actually his name sake and name after him. It was a great honer to do his eulogy and cover the wonderful accomplishments of such a great man that I have looked up to my entire life. All of my family were in attendance, which was a great thing as most of us haven't seen one another in many years. My grandfather always cared about family and made family the point and purpose of his life. Unfortunately, it required his passing to remind us of the that value. He fathered six children and had 9 grandchildren and 7 great grandchildren and they were all in attendance to honor his home going! Just two years before, in the same month I did my father's funeral and everyone was in attendance there as well. I mention this because at my grandfather's funeral the place was packed, save one empty chair. It was a touching thought that there was one chair left in honor of my father. I mentioned this in the eulogy and hoped that all in the family who know that there is a chair in our home and at the table for everyone one of them! During the funeral I preached a message as well on the lives that are lived as an anchor for others. My Grandfather was most certainly and anchor for all of us as well as grandpa and grandmas house was an anchor for our souls when traveling into town. I also expressed how our faith anchors us in the decisions that we make in life. That many time we can drift too far off course and that life has a way of blowing from our course through storms. Although the winds of life are experienced by everyone, we do not have to allow them to shipwreck us or our faith. Through faith and trust we hold on and are anchored to the rock! This was the way that my grandpa lived and that is the way that I hope to live my life as well. In all it was a bitter sweet event for me and there were tears of sadness and of joy. I am glad that my family trusted me to minister to all in this trying time. I was very humbled and honored to do it.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DUF170P
