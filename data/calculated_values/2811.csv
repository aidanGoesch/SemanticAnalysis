Today I randomly thought about one of the craziest times of my life. I'm sorry for never writing in you about it, but I just needed to time to digest it. It happened around 5 months ago. I finally went through with my kidney transplant and it changed my whole life. First things first, I thought I was going to die. Well, not really thought, but I was slightly paranoid. First because the wait for the kidney seemed to span decades and I did not actually think I would ever get a new one until my gf volunteered to do it. She is literally the best thing that ever happened to me now. I still remember holding her hand as we were wheeled into the operating room together. That was the last thing I recall before I just woke up in a strange hospital room with one of the worst pains I ever felt in my life. And I looked down and I had this really gnarly scar on my abdomen. I felt like my favorite wrestler. I was in the hospital for maybe two more days max before I finally got to return home. My girlfriend got there the same day as me and we spent so much time bonding eating jello and watching Curb Your Enthusiasm. I am so thankful for her and wouldn't trade her in for the world.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T
