I am so grateful towards it.  Being on dialysis was a real bummer.  I wasn't able to work full-time.  I relied on state health benefits, and every day was a struggle.  I seriously contemplated ending my life, because having to spend hours each day hooked up to a machine was really draining.  It absolutely sucked. Now that I have a kidney, I've been able to take over my life.  I am able to work full time.  I am able to spend a lot of time with my friends and family, and I've been able to start enjoying my hobbies more.  Before my time was spent at dialysis, but now I'm able to go hiking, and go on vacations, and go hiking, and just enjoy life. The new kidney has allowed me to appreciate life more too.  Before I got kidney disease, I wasn't really appreciating life for what its worth.  I wasn't able to fully appreciate how meaningful life is and how quickly your desire to live can be taken from you.  I hope that I'll be able to continue this appreciation throughout the rest of my life.  I know I will never again take life for granted.  I was awarded a second life through a donor, and I will forever be indebted to this.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T
