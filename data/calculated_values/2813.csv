It was very scary and exciting all at the same time. I knew I would have a transplant for a long time, as the kidney disease I had was the result of Lupus. When my kidney failure reached end-stage, I went into treatment that kept my kidney function at a certain level. It was a level that was low enough to allow you to be considered for a transplant, but not emergency-level yet. Doctors said if I could stay at that level of function, I could still live many years without needing a transplant or dialysis. After a couple of years, I started getting kidney stones and sometimes they needed surgery. They started to harm what was left of my kidney function, so I got my transplant.  The day of the transplant, I went with my husband. We had to be at the hospital very early and we left the house at 4 am. We aren't morning people and we were both nervous but there wasn't anything to really say. So we sat in relative silence for a while in the hospital room. It was about 3 hours util I went into the surgery theater. As they were wheeling me in, I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen after all the time I spent learning and worrying about it. I was very scared but I had to meet so many people and answer so many questions that it kept my mind occupied. I remember shaking with nerves while I talked to the anesthesiologist. That was the most scared I got, but it was the last thing before they started giving me medication. I don't really remember much after our conversation, until I woke up in recovery. I asked for my husband right away and I was so releived and happy. He was right there waiting so from then on he was by my side.  Once I got into my room, he stayed with me until it was late at night. After that first day I could only see him every afternoon because we lived two hours away from the hospital and he also had to keep working. I was so happy to go home after 10 days.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T
