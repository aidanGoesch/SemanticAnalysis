He had been at his former job for 10 years but they moved the plant out of state and he chose not to move.  He was given an impressive severance package and life was good for awhile collecting unemployment and salary. He made the mistake if waiting too long to start looking not ever thinking for a second he would have a hard time finding employment due to his experience and work history.  It was a lot harder than he thought due to his age.  Finally, when we had exhausted every last dime possible, a job came through. We were able to catch u[ on utility bills and we were about to start paying on outstanding debt when the unimaginable happened again.  He got laid off again!  This time around he was able to find another job but this one is so far away it is taking a toll on him mentally and physically.  I worry about him. Right now, he has been praying for some sort of relief when again, out of the blue, recruiters started calling him again.  he had three interviews last week and we are hoping for some call backs this week but doesn't look too good, it is already Tuesday and we have not heard anything yet.  All I can do is try and make his life easier and be a strong pillar for him.  When he wakes up, I have a big smile and a nice m,eal for him.  the same as when he comes home after a 14 hour day.",3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE4AGH3K,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE4AGH3K
