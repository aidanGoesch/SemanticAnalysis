We did not expect she would have left us yet. i guess you can't really prepare for it right. I know she is in a better place. I hope at least. Our family is now left to pick up the pieces. It's time for us to move on and proceed to the next level of our lives. We can go at anytime so we might as well mourn and get up and move. It's going to be an adjustment. We will however move on from this. One thing I must say though. Live your life to your maximum potential. no matter what. Life is short. Help who you can and pretty much move on from it. We have a purpose in life and try your hardest to find it.",,3GD6L00D3TJCSBNUO1QNDTPDPKGM13
