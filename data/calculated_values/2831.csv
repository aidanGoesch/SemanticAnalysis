My daughter had stated she needed to get up at 6 am even though her bus doesn't come until 7:57 am.  When I awoke at 6, she was not moving so I let her sleep.  About 6:27 when my morning alarm normally goes off, I decided to wake her up.  She is a heavy sleeper and is not a morning person.  I gave up after whipping the sheets off of her and trying to talk to her for 10 minutes to no avail.  I instead made my way to my sons room after I heard his alarm sound, helping him by grabbing new underwear and socks.  My son then said he would take care of waking my daughter as I made my way downstairs to find the rain jackets due to the thunderstorm outside.  Minutes later my daughter came down with her rainbow winged dress and my son with his Harry pOtter tuxedo shirt.  Both waited patiently for Daddy to come down and make breakfast.  Soon it was time to slip on the shoes and jackets and don the backpacks.  My son'sbus comes first at 7:30 and since this was first time at a different stop I asked if he would like us to walk him.  He at first said no, but then changed his mind.  As we walked, he said I don't want to be seen with my parents.  Gasp, he is becoming a teenager!  My husband and I silently trudged back to the house and then waited with my daughter for her bus.  She was excited, but a little hesitant because this is first time she would not have my son on the bus with her.  We sat outside on porch watching the lightning storm and I listened to her fears about getting electrocuted by the lightning.   Soon, the bus came and she had her umbrella held high but hesitated 2 times running to the bus.  She was afraid but she took a deep breath and ran.  My two babies are not babies anymore.",3GD6L00D3TJCSBNUO1QNDTPDXPEM1J,3GD6L00D3TJCSBNUO1QNDTPDXPEM1J
