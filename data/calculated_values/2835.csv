I had my master's under my belt, teaching credentials in line. I couldn't be prouder. I was finally done. I was able to get a cushy job at a private school for all grades K-12. The pay was okay, but it was more about finally being able to do what I love, what I spent so long trying to achieve. Unfortunately, we took budget cuts. I was the last hired, so I was the first fired. I had to accept a teaching job at a public school after getting used to my dreamy, safe, private school job. The pay is horrendous, it's almost like the government doesn't want kids to learn anything. I had to buy most of the supplies, and some of the kids are so poor, I ended up having to buy supplies for the kids to even be able to learn. Cheap backpacks and notebooks apparently add up. I thought my student loans were bad... these credit card bills as a public school teacher may kill me before I even get a chance to get a raise in 10 years. But these kids... They need me. I feel like I am right where I am supposed to be, helping these kids. Even if I end up having to get a part-time job on top of this to make ends meet.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLBVYM8H
