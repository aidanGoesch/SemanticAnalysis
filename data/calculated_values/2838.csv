When our first child came along, I was pretty apprehensive about being a father, since I had deliberately put off marriage and having kids for so long. What surprised me was how good being a Dad felt. My Mom had always told me, ""Its different when they're your own kids"" and damn if it wasn't true. All this ran through my mind as we drove back from dropping off my oldest son at college today. In retrospect, it all seemed to go by so fast, like things fast-forwarded from him being born until today. He is just a couple steps away from being out on his own as an adult. It was emotional experience for all of us, even our younger son, who had seemed almost happy to be the only kid in the house. Now he seems a little upset, just like my wife and I. Part of it is the knowledge that we're getting older. Retirement is just around the corner, part of the downside of starting a family late. I also worry about how our younger son feels about having parents in their 50s as a young teenager. Some of his friend's parents are a good 10 years younger than us. But we are both in good health and pretty active, so we should be around to see our youngest off to college in a few more years. Hopefully those years will go by a little slower, but I doubt it. Time does seem to go by faster and faster as you get older, another one of my parents sayings that has proven true.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLKSHM83
