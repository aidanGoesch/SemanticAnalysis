I don't know why he made such a big deal about it. He stunk at table tennis. I don't know why he even challenged me to begin with. Too bad he was such a loser about it. You should have seen how red his face got when I started teasing him about it. I made sure the girl he has a crush on was there too. You ought to have seen how mad he got then! He basically had a temper tantrum that I beat him. He did everything but throw himself on the floor after the game. I guess he thought he was going to win. It was a strange game. I thought maybe he was losing on purpose. You see, he had been bragging around about how good he was. I said I knew how to play. It was like the other day, I tried poker. I know how to play, I just don't.",,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L4ES5WH
