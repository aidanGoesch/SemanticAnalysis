My rating was around 1750 so I didn't have much chances against other 2k players. There was this one asian guy Albert with rating over 100 points bigger than mine. He wanted to warm up first... after regulatory 2 minutes of warm up I asked him is he ready. He said he is not, so we continued to warm up. After five minutes, I just started smashing because I wanted the warm up to be over - I was sweating and really tired already. Then he said he was ready. I beat him 3-1 ! It was amazing, I gained over 30 points out of him. I went to him to shake his hand and he was very rude - he said I didn't give him enough time to warm up. I felt soooo good by telling him how it's not my responsibility to warm him up and that with his rating he should beat me easily without warming up. I told him I will enjoy taking his rating points. He then said it's un-sportsmanship conduct and I explained to him that by table tennis regulations there should be only 2 minutes of warm up and I gave him 5.It was pure luck than after round robin ended, I was supposed to play against Albert AGAIN in 1/8th. He refused to play with me ! He was so afraid he will loose more rating points, he didn't want a rematch. What a cry baby I said... I went up to him and I said - come on Albert... nobody likes cry babies. Don't be a coward and come play. All players were laughing but he still refused to play. Really good day ! ;)",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L4ES5WH,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L4ES5WH
