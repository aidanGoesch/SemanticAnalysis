Day after day I go to look for work withe the same old responses 'we will give you a call' of coarse they never do. I have gone from being scared to being terrified. I have never been in this position before. I have always been able to financially take care of myself,but now I have run thru all my resourses . I find myself one day from eviction and wondering if I will be able to eat.  The job I lost I had worked for ten years and never thought it would end. I'm the kind of person who used to be optimistic to my family and friends,but I find myself down and depressed wondering if this nightmare will end. I have considered going back to school for training for a better career, but that still leaves the problem of income to live on. I fear my next alternative is to ask my parents for help when they can barely take care of themselves. I have resorted to recycling bottles to try and make a little cash,but the amount is so small its not worth my effort. We live in America,the greatest country in the world no one should have to suffer this way. Now I have more appreciation and sympathy for the homeless. I wonder every day now if I will ever find work and if I do will it last. It's a terrifying thought. I wish I could win the lottery and be rich so all my troubles would end. I must overcome and fight my way back to the top and I will.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DUP770F
