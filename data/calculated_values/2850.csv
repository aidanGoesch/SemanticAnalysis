It was so beautiful. It was right after the holidays and the place was decorated in almost a Christmas like theme but more winter. My sister looked stunning. She wore a long sleeve dress that was plain and simple but the arms and the back were shear that gave it a little something extra. I stayed with her while we got ready and got our hair and makeup done. I went for a simple up do and natural makeup. My sister kept her hair down with a clip and went for natural make up as well. We were allowed to pick out our own bridesmaid dresses as long as they were a shade of red. Her bridal party was just me and our other sister. We arrived to the wedding that evening and it was pouring. It was okay though because the wedding was inside and we did not need to worry about the weather. We finished getting ready and the guests started to fill in. I walked down the aisle and it was beautiful. It was all pine and lights, they did a great job. Then my sister walked down the aisle and she really took my breath away. She looked so beautiful and so happy. I almost cried but just got teary eyed. The wedding ceremony was beautiful  and quick. It was right to the point and I liked that. Once the ceremony was over we went to cocktail hour and they had delicious hor'dourves. The real fun was when the party began. They had great music and we danced the night away. It was a great wedding and I am so happy for my sister and able to be a part of her day.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LXCI5WW,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LXCI5WW
