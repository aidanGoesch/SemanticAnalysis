She had asked me to be the executor of her trust so we spent a lot of time together going over important details and how to handle things after her death. We expected her to live a lot longer, but she died suddenly and not from the cancer. She was in the middle of her treatments, going for radiation and chemo, her hair was starting to fall out and she shaved her head. My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything. She lived with her grandson, who is 23. He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life. One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke. She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this. We went to visit her a few times in the hospital. My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power. She was not going to come back and be herself. She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really. She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond. She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken. So the decision was made to let her go. It was sad that she died this way, and so soon. We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke. I then had to take over as executor of her trust which wasn't an easy task, and I had to inform people of her death and post on Facebook for her.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LZ2FW52,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LZ2FW52
