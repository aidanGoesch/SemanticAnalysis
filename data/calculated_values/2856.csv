I ended up going to the Blue Ridge and Smoky Mountains of North Carolina and it was absolutely breathtaking. From the waterfalls to the insane views, I loved every minute of it. I really didn't realize how much I needed this escape to the mountains until I was there. I was in nature and surrounded by the beauty of it. It felt so relaxing and peaceful and I loved every minute of it. I wish I could just build a cabin up there and live there forever. I actually surprised myself with my fitness. Yes, it was hard at first, but made me feel so good and gave me an extreme confidence boost for what I can tackle. But trust me, I slept really well at night. Hopefully, I can go back there or maybe a new place in the future. It was definitely worth it for my mental sanity alone. I've also been keeping up with my exercise since I got back. I didn't realize what a stress reliever exercise could be. Hopefully, that sticks in my mind and I can find the determination to keep that up.",,3GGAI1SQEWKWFEXS4YF7UP84AGQCMH
