I have reached the age in which the marking of another year is more negative than positive. But, this year was different, in a good way. My girlfriend did everything that she could to make it a special day for me. She took time off of work, which is difficult at her job. Although money is tight, she spent what she could. But her attention and love was more important than the money spent. Along with a few small but meaningful gifts, she made all of my favorite foods over a three day period. So, in essence, she stretched out my birthday and made it awesome. The days were filled with good times. We ventured out of our apartment and did fun, goofy stuff, like play miniature golf and day drink  with some tourists. And the evening were spent watching old horror movies and snuggling up on the couch. I know that this may not sound like much, but it was exactly what I needed. Now, I am planning to do something just as special for her birthday. I just hope that she enjoys her birthday as much as I enjoyed mine.",,3GGAI1SQEWKWFEXS4YF7UP84YT5MCK
