I moved from my parents house and packed up all my belongings over the course of a week or so, then my girlfriend drove down from Northern Maine(I lived in Mass). We loaded up her car and mine, and began the 7 hour drive to our new place. After several weeks of preparation, organizing everything and getting stuff set up and purchased how we would need them, we were finally ready for this huge transition. In the coming weeks after that long drive, we unpacked everything and set up our new place how we wanted it. There was a lot of frustration and sweat and swearing as we struggled to shift furniture around the apartment, but we managed. Then some weeks later, I managed to find a job in a medical office. A position I took to readily and have since been excelling at. The actual act of moving was a stressful one, we spent a lot of time worrying ourselves over money, over my ability to find a job, over how I""d manage to work out my schooling, all of it. Not to mention the fact that my family strongly disapproved of the decision and began treating me incredibly poorly once I broke the news to them. We drove for several hours before making our first stop, me trailing behind her, as her car was larger and she had packed it up to the point where she couldn't really see behind her. We stopped to pick up something to drink and use the restroom, as well as refuel our cars. THe drive was one we'd made many times before so the actual act of driving wasn't too bad, however, it was somewhat exhausting for her since she made the drive down just the day prior. With the cars refueled we went a ways further, before stopping for some Burger King. The rest of the trip was pretty uneventful, and we stopped first at our new apartment to drop off some of the stuff. However, since we got in at around 10pm, we were too tired to really move everything in in earnest, so we went to her parent's house to sleep. Bright and early the next day, we began the long process of moving my stuff, as well as hers, into our new place. Hours upon hours of moving stuff, lifting it up stairs, shifting it around, just general struggle. But ultimately, we have our place exactly how we want it, and I loved the experience.",3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PNIIDG2,3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PNIIDG2
