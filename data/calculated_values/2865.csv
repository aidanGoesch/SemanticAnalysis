I have around 14 years of experience with crystal skulls. About 6 more years experience than my friend does. I went to school for this. I also had numerous jobs that entailed thorough discussion and thought about crystal skulls. My friend obviously does not really want me to participate in her company. I have known her for almost 12 years. I got her into crystal skulls. I feel very angry about this. Why doesn't she want me to be apart of her company? Am I not good enough? I only want to help her organization, but she refuses me to work with her. I just feel really hurt that my friend wouldn't want me to be apart of her organization. Why ask me to speak on behalf of your organization if I am not even considered to be apart of the team? What is it that I lack that I am not a good candidate to help out with her organization? I just want to get to the bottom of all of this.",,3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PQ0EGD4
