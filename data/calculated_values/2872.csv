I was so excited that he was able to go and be able to work on getting his degree. It was hard to have him just sit around and not have anything to do, like his peers who had gone straight to college from graduating. The school is close by and his schedule has fluctuated a lot, but its been worth it in the end. He eventually hopes to be an architect and I am so proud of what he's done so far. Its interesting to hear what he does in class or the different requirements he has to meet. I was shocked to see how the cost of college has changed. Since I was in school it has doubled in price. I don't think you are getting more value for the price and its slightly outrageous how much just community college costs. I can't imagine what it would be like to go to a four year college. I don't know how some parents are able to afford it. With his talent and ability its worth it and all I can say is how proud of him I am. And I will support him throughout school and after when he moves on to finding a job. He hasn't tried looking for a job just to have some extra money or to support himself while in school but I think he might also do that soon. It would be nice if he is able to get hired at an architectural firm, even as an intern so he can learn the aspects of the job.",3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88GANTMC,3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88GANTMC
