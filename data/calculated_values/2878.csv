We visited many different tourist destinations. Yellowstone National Forest, Mount Rushmore, and a wildlife park to name a few. One of the attractions we visited was Bad Lands National Park. The rock formations were stunning, and We took many photos. This event was particularly special to me, because I have wanted to visit this park since I Was a little girl. A teacher shared pictures of her own vacation with me, and from that moment on, I have wanted to visit.  My visit was everything I have always imagined and more! My family and I saw American Bison, prairie dogs, Big Horn Sheep, and so many birds! One of the most exciting moments was when my children were able to get very close to a prairie dog for a picture! The sun was so hot that day, but there was a nice breeze over the prairie. My children and I climbed a couple of large rock formations together, and the view from the top was spectacular! This park was one of the things we did that all ages enjoyed. My parents and children were equally impressed with the land formations and animals.  I plan to return on my next visit out West.",3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88MPSTMH,3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88MPSTMH
