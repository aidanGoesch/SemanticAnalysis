I kept telling them that we live here but were not involved in the crime. However, a neighbor told the police my parents were outside where the crime was happening. Even though it's been 6 months since that day I still can't stop thinking about it. A couple lived right down the road and they resemble my parents a lot. I heard some chatter on the street that they were both involved with a local gang. Evidently, they stole a phone and purse from the scene and their child has been carrying the purse around. I contacted to police and explained what I had heard on the block and they decide to visit this home. Upon arriving they were able to find the purse laying on a lawn chair and some other personal items that belonged to the victims. They arrested the couple and released my family. We are thinking about suing the county for all the distress they have caused my family. I guess we will have to wait and see what happens at trial. The couple had to move out of the rental house while they were in jail. I'm still stunned that this happened! What would have happened if I didn't find this information out? I could not imagine my parents staying in jail and being tried for a crime they did not commit.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DVLU70V
