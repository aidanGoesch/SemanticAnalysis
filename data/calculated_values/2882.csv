I earned money several months through Mturk and plasma selling to make enough to afford food, toiletry, proper clothing, and fees so I could go to trucking school. After getting an okay amount of money and supplies, I headed on a bus to the school in the beginning of February. I arrived in a hotel extremely confused as I was in a hotel different from where I was told I would be which gave me an overall bad feeling about the experience. Regardless I went to bed and woke the next morning too early as I wasnt given an actual time about when things started for us but found my way to the proper building eventually that day. After getting into the building everything went smoothly with learning what was going on and what the rules were and general information on what I needed to know. I earned my Class A permit before going to the school while I was ""turking"" so my first week went a little smoother than some other classmates who had to get their Class A permit within 4 days. I also read and learned the permit book in 4 days so I knew they could do it. Fast forward the first week goes by, its only classroom things like learning to shift on computer simulators and what to expect and getting our documents in. Week 2 we actually get in the trucks and learn pre-trip and backing skills. I absolutely ace pre-trip even though people still maintain today that it is the hardest part. My backing was pretty much fine as in it wasn't the best but wasn't the worst. Almost every day I was in a truck I wanted to quit and I remember wondering whether or not future me would continue to go through with this. I was scared around 50% of my days in the last two of three weeks. Fast forward week two my backing is doing great, I aced all 4 things on my evaluation (straight line backing, pre-trip, parallel parking, offset parking) so I'm able to move to road driving week three. I'm of course scared but I get it done and by the end of week three I was told I was testing slightly early than I expected (a Thursday instead of the expected Saturday). I genuinely did not feel ready as not only did i hit a curb 2 out of 3 times in my road test, I was also struggling at parallel parking despite doing it fine at station 2 in week 2. So that Thursday i went in for the test and aced pre-trip, offset, and straight line backing, but failed my parallel parking. I was pretty much down the entire day and couldn't figure out why I parked so well at station 2 but not station 3. The next day I practice backing until I'm absolutely sick of it and was scheduled to retest Saturday morning first thing. That morning I passed everything easily with flying colors much to my surprise but I felt relieved, excited, yet still nervous because I knew this was only the beginning.",3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZ9A1Q5B,
