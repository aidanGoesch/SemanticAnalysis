Being a pizza delivery driver was one of the longest jobs I had ever held and it was a pretty relaxed job once I stopped stressing over how late the delivery may or may not be. When I told my father he was surprised asking me every few days, ""you're not scared?"" I honestly wasn't, I guess at the time I was more concerned about having enough money to last me during the schooling phase. So February after earning enough money to last me roughly two weeks (which by the way was a lot less than what I actually needed) I got on the greyhound to earn my place in this world. I had studied and earned my CLP (commercial learner's permit) while I did the odd jobs to get the money I needed for the trip. I arrived at night in a completely different hotel than was told I would be in and that frazzled me immediately. With literally no information about where I go next and when I decided to just go to sleep early and get on with it. Fast forward to the beginning of week two. This is where the fear sets in. The fear my father kept asking me if I felt 3 months ago had finally latched onto my heart and head. It was time to actually turn on and drive the truck to do my first backing maneuver. The first maneuver was actually pretty simple, just drive forward and back up.  Well it SOUNDS simple but it really isn't; the back of that 53 foot trailer wants to go in directions you didn't give it permission to go in. You had to learn to control the trailer and make sure it stays straight and doesn't continue to offtrack right or left. Eventually I got it down even though I genuinely felt I wasn't going to be able to do it. Then came the next maneuver which was offset parking. Take your trailer and move it to the very next spot. This took some time but eventually I got it after again thinking I wouldn't be able to do it. Then the next maneuver, parallel parking. Just thinking about parallel parking a truck still frazzles me to this day, but eventually I nailed it in five minutes, or so I thought. After practicing all three maneuvers till I got sick of them came test day. In my first station I had nailed all three maneuvers after much practice perfectly. In the last practice station I had trouble with parallel but ended up doing a prefect parallel right before I tested. Because my results had been inconsistent I wasn't exactly sure how I would test but long story short I ended up failing the parallel my first try during the test. I felt so defeated and extremely sad but I wasn't going to let it stop me considering I hated the thought of going back home with mom and dad. In forty eight hours I gave it another try and nailed it being one of three out of twenty four other students in my group able to get my CDL in three weeks",3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZ9A1Q5B,3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZ9A1Q5B
