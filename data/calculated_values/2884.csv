I discovered i was having cold which i did not really take too serious. This cold was not the normal cold the whether could have caused. I skipped that day hoping the next day gonna be better. On the next day i woke up strong and healthy. Before noon, I developed a sudden and a strange severe pain, which i never expected that could happen due to my health condition. I endure this pain for many hours, Later that day i decided to go to the ER after worrying it could be very serious. I went straight to see our family doctor fortunately, I met him on a good condition, He attended to me. I explained to him exactly how i was feeling and from my explanation he could figure out what could be happening. I sense this could be a stroke and was given the all clear. I was placed on medication and was given medicine. I left and started using this pills and a change begin to happen the next day. I felt so clear that i will be fine as my body was responding to treatment. though out the week i took this medication so serious and after all i became better. I was so surprise been so getting better so quick because something similar to this happen to someone i know that took him many month to get recover from it. but my was so surprise and feel happy that i could get fit back again.",,3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZI475QT
