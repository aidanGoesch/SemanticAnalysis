It began the same, mid way also. The night was what changed everything. I developed and woke up to an extreme pain. This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain. It was intense, extreme, unbearable. Nothing would help it, not over the counter medications, or rest. It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing. Being that I suffer from anxiety and am getting up there in age, I began to worry. Was this very serious? I contemplated my options all the while suffering. Do I go to the ER? A local Urgent Care? I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain. It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature. Was it a spider bite? So many things raced through my mind. Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated. This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected. After finally coming to and going to the ER, this was confirmed. I was given antibiotics and went home. I have since fully recuperated thankfully.",3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZI475QT,3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZI475QT
