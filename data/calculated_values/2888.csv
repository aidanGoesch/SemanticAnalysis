Since I enjoy riding my motorcycle in these off days, I figured today would be a great day. I woke up early so I could get whatever I needed to finished at home. After I was finished I checked the weather and once I say it would be good, got ready to go on my motorcycle ride. My plans were to spend about an hour or two on the normal route I go, but that changed later on. The first half of my trip went as normal. I took in the views and spent most of the time relaxing. I was listening to music during the ride too. The weather was nice and there weren't too many cars on the road. I was starting to think it was time to head back. I figured I would take one last road before heading home. The road was one that I hadn't road on in an of my trips, so I thought it would be nice to check it out. Instead, things went much differently. There was a car coming from the other side of the road, and just as we were both getting close to each other a deer jumped out at us from the woods. I had to quickly steer myself off the road, as to not hit either the door or the other car. I ended up crashing into a tree and the other car made it by fine and the deer jumped away unharmed. The other car stopped and waiting around with me for the police to arrive, and I made it out with only minor injuries.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB3VWAP3
