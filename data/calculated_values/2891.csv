I have always wanted to be an architect my whole life. My parents tell me how i used to only play with building models and drawings throughout my childhood. I guess that passion was always in me. Studying architecture was definitely harder than i had thought. So much calculations. Units. The artistic element seems to be missing in our colleges these days. However, i was thrilled after graduation. I applied to all the major firms in the state for an opening position. No responses for a few months. I was getting downhearted. However, to my greatest surprise, the email from the top architecture agency of the state was waiting for me on my birthday weekend. Best birthday gift ever! I am starting in a week, and i am thrilled.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB5MIAP9
