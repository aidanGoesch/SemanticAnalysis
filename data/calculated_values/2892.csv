After a few false alarms, we thought it was futile to try. However, we were encouraged to give it one more try by a family friend. Although we were discouraged, we decided to give it one more try. Six weeks later, a doctor confirmed that my wife was pregnant. We got a sonogram and found out that we were going to have a baby boy. How precious! After years of trying, it has culminated into this. No other moment compares. The night my son was born, I held him. When I held him for the first time, I can't clearly describe how happy I was to hold him. It was as if my family was finally becoming whole. Thankfully, he was a healthy baby boy, and we were able to take him home with us after a few days. Having a child is an experience unlike any other. Any parent who shares the same love and joy for their children will tell you the same.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB5OYAPT
