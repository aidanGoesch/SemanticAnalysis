However, to those who were fortunate enough to be part of the vacation, it meant everything. This family vacation story also shows how important family really is. family. Vacation is also a time where my entire family and I can wind down and relax for a week without having to worry.  Family is important, and we do not always have the time to cherish or express how much we love each other. Nevertheless, having the opportunity to go on these small trips is special to me.  Going to the Peace Gardens was somewhere that I will always remember. And we  Disney World thinks it’s going to be the vacation of a lifetime. Everything seemed to be going smoothly that morning. My family was very happy.  When we arrived at the restaurant me and my sister ordered a gigantic hamburger, my wife and children. we finish we were all very satisfied and we headed for a little fun. We saw some lights in the far end and we followed them. We arrived at a show it was called the electrical parade and it was really cool. So we went down there last summer and it was a big vacation for all of us. I know it was more of an children’s vacation which but it was very fun and we all loved. In my opinion we are a little too old for Disney World but it was my favorite vacation.",,3GS6S824SRJBBUOXXQU8JY477MINW1
