We would go up north to the small town where my dad grew up and watch the parade. Then we would grill out all day before watching fireworks at night. As an only child with just my parents, this wasn't exactly the most exciting time of my life. To put it bluntly, I was downright bored. So bored that I even tried to make some friends in that small town, to no avail. I swear I've been complaining about this routine trip to my parents for years, but two months ago they actually listened. Instead of the usual trip with us three, we would be joined by the entirety of my mom's side of the family. That meant a total of ten cousins, including six which are around my age. It was awesome! Instead of sitting in a chair watching dad flip burgers and mom stir potato salad, I was playing tackle football with my cousins in the field. Even the fireworks were more fun as everyone reacted loudly to their favorite style of firework. Overall it felt like a totally different vacation, and it surprised me that I could have so much fun in a place where I am usually bored stiff. My mom's family and all my cousins have already pledged their attendance for next year, so we should have a great time once again. Heck, my parents even thanked me for asking to alter our vacation plans by inviting more people. It's a shame they didn't listen to me years ago!",,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHMHLPBQ
