Two months ago, inner me felt daring and confident and, dare I say, bold as I applied for a job way out of my league. I felt like it was time for a change. Not time to be humbled by a company. I passed all the tests, like a freaking miracle from God himself. Did well on the meetings beforehand, and then pretty much got schooled during the exit interview. It was like going from Kindergarten math to Theoretical General Relativity combined with Advanced Calculus. It was like trying to impress Bill Nye the Science Guy, and then freaking Stephen Hawking comes out and asks you to prove him wrong with facts and science. I shouldn't be so hard on myself or get so worked up... I got farther than I thought I'd get with that job. To even get a call was huge because I was WILDLY unqualified for that position, but I wanted to... I don't know... prove myself, maybe? I feel like my opportunities are being wasted in my little 9 to 5 here. I could be so much more, do so much more. I want to show everyone that I am a powerful, independent source to be reckoned with and that I have so much offer. Maybe I should have said all this during the exit interview rather than rambling like a 5 month old baby. Oh well. Onto the next, I guess.",,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHO7UBP3
