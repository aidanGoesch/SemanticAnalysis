I keep having this nagging feeling that I want to stay home with my daughter. I have thought about once again stepping out and trying to find a new job closer to my home. Currently I am having to drive 30 min one way to work. I am trying to decide if I once again want to step out of my comfort zone and apply for a new position with a new company. There are a lot of things to consider when it comes to this. I have put 6 years in at my current place of employment and therefore I am getting optimum benefits. It will be hard for me to start over somewhere but I am willing to do so if I get better pay and benefits. We will just have to I would love to find a way to make money with my own business. At this point of don’t have a clue of what I could do. see how it goes and if anything that I want to apply for presents itself. I want to be comfortable but also make the most money and get to spend the most time with my family especially my daughter while she is young. once I find a position I will know. I will have to identify if it will be the right fit for me. I can tell these kinds of things by just knowing in my heart. I do like my current company so I will have weigh the pros and cons of both. We will see which way life takes me.,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHO7UBP3,
