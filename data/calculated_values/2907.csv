I was nervous to move to a new department and to have new coworkers. I have been in the same position for sometime. I am not a person who loves change. But it was time to step out of my comfort zone and do what was best for my family. This position comes with a significant raise and I am excited to see where this can take my family. In order to get this position I went directly to the department manager and asked for an interview. I felt that this was a bold move but I was tired of where I was in the company. I wasnâ€™t being paid for my degree and I knew there was no opportunity to move up. I was very nervous and scared to be disappointed or let down with myself. I had to go through several different interviews, with COO, CFO and the manager. This drug on for weeks not knowing if this was going to work out. I had already planned many things in my mind for my family and was thinking how well this would benefit us in the long run .I am so glad that everything worked out and despite the fact that it was stressful, I am very proud of myself. Going forward, I am planning on taking more chances and risks for my family and being more confident that good things happen when you take risks. This made me think that good things do happen when you work hard.",3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHO7UBP3,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHO7UBP3
