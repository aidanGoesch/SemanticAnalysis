They've been married for the last 35 years. As always, they organized an event to celebrate this important occasion. Although they thought that this was any other normal anniversary, you can imagine they had already celebrated 34, this was different. The children had planned something special for their big guys. All the four children are now employed, and thus everyone thought of contributing something small. In the end, we thought o taking our parents to vacation in Paris. This has been a dream vacation for my dad and mum. As my parents cut a birthday cake, my elder sister presented the two tickets to my dad and mum. This is the moment I can never forget. My dad and mum cried of the surprise. As they embraced everyone, the shed tears of joy. This showed me that parents need are and affection, just like children. The celebration ended with everyone happy and teary. Can I really forget the moment? I cannot forget such a moment. It will remain with me forever.",,3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HP24ER0
