I am broken. So many questions, no answers. Is it my fault? Why did this happen? All these didn't questions and emotions and I can't decipher them. How did I become the wife of an adulterer. I never thought it would happen to me. I never thought he was the kind of man to do this. I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this. He has asked for forgiveness but given the length of time he has been doing this I feel like its unforgivable. It if had been a bad lapse of judgment a one time thing maybe two, I could possibly forgive that but 2 years. Come on I don't think I can.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6370B
