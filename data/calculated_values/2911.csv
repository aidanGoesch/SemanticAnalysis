We've been super close since than. Two month ago she finally decided to marry her school sweetheart. I knew him from school too and he is a great friend of mine. He asked me to help him to arrange his proposal because nobody knows her better than I do. So we started planning it about 5 month ago but two first proposals didn't work out. So we had to come up with something very sweet but easy to arrange. We booked a whole winery for her. We made this proposal a pron theme. I printed all the pictures of us back in school. We invited all of our friends. I flew in her family to surprise her. It was one of the best days in my life. She was so happy and touched about all the details of the proposal and she knew right away that I did it because nobody else had those pictures. I brought also our prom dresses that surprisingly still fit us. It was a great day and I will always remember it.,3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HQWMREK,
