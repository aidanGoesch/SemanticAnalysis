My son will now be 14 this year. It’s so difficult when your child becomes a teenager. It’s like a whole other person is emerging from them. I think the most successful thing to do while going through these changes is to remember that your goal is to have them depart from you successfully. It is very hard to see your children grow up but they are going to inevitably. Parents should strive to make sure their children are able to be independent functioning adults and contribute to society. Although, as a mother I can say I do not care how old my son gets he will always be my baby and my firstborn. He is a pretty cool team and has made it easy for me. I do not like him getting older but there’s nothing I can do about it except pray for his life and the best things for it.￼￼ if I had to give any advice to other mothers it would be listen to your children. I am thrilled that my 13-year-old still wants to talk to me every day about his day. I pray when he turns 14 he wants to do the same. I pray he does it forever honestly. I would like to continue a healthy driving relationship with my adult children. It’s nice to be able to journal these emotion and express how it feels to watch your children grow up.￼￼￼ It certainly helps to vent and get those feelings out.",3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HQYNREP,
