We had a long relationship that had many ups and downs. We dated for a total of 5 years, however during those 5 years we have had various small breakups but would eventually get back together. This time, after the breakup, I feel like there is no turning back and its over. Why do I get this feeling? The way she broke up with me was extremely rude and nonchalant. She woke up in the middle of the night and called me. What did she say in the call? Well, half asleep- she said she was done with the relationship and didn't love me anymore. Who breaks up when they are half asleep? It was ridiculous but the next day she reaffirmed that what she did was what she wanted. Well, I accepted it and moved on. I am already doing much better and its only been a few weeks. Yesterday she emailed me saying ""the tables have turned, I feel bad about it now"". I am thankful that my emotions did not get the better of me, I just accepted it and kept moving on. This is having the effect of it seeming she wants me back, however it doesn't matter as I have made other plans with a different woman.",3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HRK9REK,3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HRK9REK
