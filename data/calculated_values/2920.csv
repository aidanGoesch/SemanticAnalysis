After doing some research and getting recommendations from friends I called the highest rated therapist I could find. I was very nervous about this experience because I have never been able to share how I truly feel with anyone. I always worry about them judging me and no one in my life has really truly understood. I have had a lot of hardships as a child and I don't want to share all of them with people I have to see on a day to day basis. Finally the day came and I had my first therapist appointment. As I walked up the steps to the therapists office I was deep in thought. Was this the right choice? I was so nervous. I slowly began to climb the stairs. On the third step my deep concentration on the talk to come distracted me from my climb and I fell backward down the stairs and hit my head. Pain burst through my scalp and my head immediately began throbbing. I reached to the back of my head and felt wetness. I yelled for help. The therapist came running out of her office and called 911. I was rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with a minor concussion and got 3 stitches for the cut in my head. So much for my first therapy visit. After a week of rest and recovery I once again returned to my therapists office and this time I carefully used the railing as I climbed the stairs. Today I safely made it in to the office for my first official appointment. The first appointment went ok. I was a little nervous but the therapist was kind and I decided to come back twice a week at her suggestion. Since that day I have been seeing her twice a week and I have been able to share many difficult feelings. The more I see her the more I trust her and the more I am able to share about my experiences. Sometimes details that I have not thought about in many years come to me between visits so it is very useful to be able to return later in the week to discuss again. My therapist has become an amazing support in my life and I will never forget my first therapeutic experiences.,,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6FQGWQ
