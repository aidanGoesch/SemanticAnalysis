My graduation ceremony was set back. The cause was my dry cleaner was late on delivering my cloth of the day. This made my feet sweaty. This got resolved and I had the ceremony. I celebrated in a big style with my family and friends. My mom gave me a big hug and had some tears. My dad shook my hand and also had tears. My friends all jumped up and down at the ceremony. We all had a great time. I had some tears that I was finally done with school. We all went out for some pizza to celebrate. I got a meat lovers by myself. I barely finished the pizza. I will remember this forever.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN34GWX
