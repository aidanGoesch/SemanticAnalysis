We were both really nervous and on edge when we applied, our credit scores have been suffering lately since we racked up a little credit card debt on top of our student loans. But even in spite of our credit, we ended up getting the place we really wanted. We looked for so long and finally found just the right place, I mean we knew we would have to downsize our things coming from a house, but we just knew it would be worth it. The new place is so walkable, our neighbors are interesting and the place is gorgeous and just our style. The problem started though when we really got into downsizing. I thought it was going to be so much easier than it was, we were arguing all the time about who had to throw out what. There was a lot of resentment and hurt feelings, because naturally, the things that aren't yours don't mean much to you. So when I saw Derek's skis that he hadn't used for nearly two years I was determined to make him get rid of them. Why would we need skis in South Carolina?? We never take those kinds of trips. Or any trips really, so that started another fight about how we never travel anymore and it just became a huge mess. Who knew that something so seemingly insignificant as throwing out some clutter could bring up so many unrealized problems? I really saw how bitter I was about not traveling anywhere aside from our family homes and feeling like we were becoming boring. Really, this apartment and it's proximity to some excitement and nightlife was the hope on the horizon. The only obstacle being that we were at each other's throats and still loaded down with junk. I made a lot of concessions and threw out so many things, and unfortunately I threw out things out of resentment too. I regret tossing my white linen blazer. Who cares if he thought it looked silly? I really liked it. Anyway, we ended up getting through it all and moving into our dream house (apartment). I really love this new place, and I've been walking or riding my bike everywhere. I found a great new coffee shop that makes the most perfect peppermint mocha I've ever had, I found a little pub a few blocks away that has some killer bar food and great ambiance, and the shopping around here is perfect. This is exactly how I've always wanted to live, and it seems surreal that I get to have it now. The only thing I'm missing is my amazing relationship with Derek. Ever since our downsizing debacle we've been a little bitter and petty, hopefully everything will get back to normal soon and I can take him to all the great places I've found.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAUX5WG9
