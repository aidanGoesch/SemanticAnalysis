She had some health issues in her adult life.  She was diagnosed with diabetes when she was in her 40's.  She had surgery on her neck a few months before she passed away.  She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.  She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.  She had a meeting with someone from her church that morning.  She went outside to show her friend her garden and then her friend left.  She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.  We had video footage from security cameras to show us exactly what happened.  She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.  She braced herself temporarily before falling to the ground completely.  My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance.  She was basically on life support from that time until she passed away about 8 hours later.  It has been 5 months since it happened and it still seems so surreal.  I miss her smile and I miss her laugh.  She had the best laugh!  It will be difficult when our family gets together for the holidays this year but we will pull together and honor her in the best way possible.,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G,
