About 4 months ago I took the ultimate plunge. One of the bravest things a man can do. I married the love of my life. I can still remember it so clearly. How I woke up 3 hours early from nerves, as if I slept at all. The bed felt empty without her but she does love her tradition. I got out of bed nervous and excited the two emotions wrestling around in my brain. I hopped in the shower and scrubbed up imagining how beautiful my future wife would be walking down the aisle in her dress. After my shower I carefully pulled out the fancy tux she insisted on picking herself and put myself together pulling the stiff clothes over my body. My family had stayed the night in the cabin rental with me along with some college buddies and were waiting for me downstairs. My fiance had her dream wedding planned since childhood and she always wanted to be married next to a roaring waterfall! One as powerful as the love she would have to have to commit herself to one man forever. We all piled into the rental car and started to head towards Abaloosha falls. To my dismay raindrops started to hit the windshield of our car. I felt my stomach drop. How could it be raining today of all days the most important of our lives. I begged whatever entity out there to please cut it out just for a little while, but it continued. I thought about my bride and if she was upset. We drove for about 45 minutes or so and to my extreme delight rays of sun started to peek through the clouds and the rain began to stop. We ended up getting to have our dream wedding with the sun shining through the water and my now wifes beauty shining over me. I thank everyday for her. I cant wait to live the rest of my life with this woman.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT
