My mother and I haven't been seeing eye to eye on things and often times, we end up fighting. I had moved out about 6 months ago when an apartment opened up. My mom was furious about me leaving but then got so mad about it that she stopped talking to me. My now girlfriend lives next door to me in the apartment complex. When I had moved in, we spent a lot of time talking as she was helping me get settled into the place. I had told her about my mother being the way she is. Her mom was the same way and we bonded over that. A about 2 months ago, my mom started calling me again. She was begging me to come home since she had ran out of money. I couldn't believe that she searched me out just because she needed money! I talked to my girlfriend about it and she told me that you know, sometimes it's hard to just let your parents deal with what they are dealing with. I still wasn't sure about it. I knew that I was happier away from her. My girlfriend told me that I have to choose what is right for me. I ended up telling my mom I was sorry and I hope that she figured things out. I haven't talked to her sense then, but my brother calls and tells me she's fine.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAWE0GWO
