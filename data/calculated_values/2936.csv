I never thought that I'd be able to meet someone and I was never thinking about it. But it has changed a lot of my views and thoughts about people. She is kind and considerate and brings out the best in me. Her viewpoints were different than mine and it helped me with a lot of the issues I was having with family. I believe I wouldn't strive for a better job if it weren't for her. I wouldn't be wanting a family.  Recently my mother for wanted me to come home and take care of my cousins children. I was conflicted and didn't know what to do. My gf told me that it is my choice and that just because my mother is family doesn't mean i am forced to do something for her. That she herself wasn't even their for me and didn't even care about me even when I was young. It wasn't her who took care of me, so why should I return the favor to someone who was so unwanting of me? So she said that I have my own life and to pave my own path -- so I did and I want it to be with her. I want to bare children with her and I want to start a family. I want a life that I was never given and I just want to spend as much time with her as I can.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAWE0GWO
