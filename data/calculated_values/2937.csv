I received the best news that I could have hoped for. I am all good and cancer free! This has been a rollercoaster of a year. I have been able to relax and enjoy the holidays with my family knowing that I'm not going to be leaving them any time soon. Well, I know that anything could happen but at least it's not that! I am so glad that I went for that exam last spring. I can't imagine how this would have gone had the cancer not been found when it was. I have so many plans for the future now. I feel like I had been taking so many things for granted. I want to follow through on all those things that I just never made time for. It's amazing how a scare like this can change your perspective. I have two young children and a wonderful life. Sometimes I get really upset thinking what would have happened if my PSA results had not been good. I'm also grateful that I have such great health insurance. It is such a privilege that this scare didn't also bankrupt us. I am relieved that my treatment didn't put us in debt.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAXIFWGS
