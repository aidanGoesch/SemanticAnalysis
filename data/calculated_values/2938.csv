Had my prostate removed in August. Everything went well during the surgery. After surgery the Doctor said everything looks good. The doctor said he wants me to get out of bed and walk around as soon as possible. He said looks like you will be able to go home in the morning. The next morning the doctor came in the room and asked how i was feeling? I said i was feeling good. He said that i can go home today. Went home that day with a catheter in. I was feeling pretty good. A little sore and uncomfortable with the catheter. However all and all feeling pretty good. A week after surgery i had a return appointment with the doctor. He wanted to remove the catheter if possible. After a leak test not sure what that is called. He removed the catheter. Doctor said everything is looking good. Next he wanted me to get a PSA test in 6 weeks. I took the PSA test and had a return appointment the next week. That would have been on October 8, 2019. Had the test done. Doctor said PSA looks good.  I will have another PSA test in January 2020. If all is good the doctor said we will check my PSA every 3 months for the first year.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAXIFWGS,
