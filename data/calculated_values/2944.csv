That day I was walked through the roadside. At that time I saw that a children was begging to peoples for some food.  I was very upset to saw that. In our world now a days so many children's beg for food and we are wasting the food. It is not good to our living world. When I saw that i ran to the pass of the child. Then I brought some food items and gave it to him. He was very happy. I saw that a cute smile is on his face. When i saw that my mind is filled with lots of joy and happiness. and I was asking to him where is your house. He had no answer for that question. He have only a smile on his face. finally I realize that there are so many children's like this.,,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM01OPLK
