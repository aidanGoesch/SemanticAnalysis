Even though ive been through many storms never the less it always puts me on high alert. i started to prepare for the winds that were expected and cleaning up the yard of any flying debris. i also worked within the house to gather up belongings should i have to flee my new mobile home. my imagination ran wilder than before because i just moved into a mobile and pictured the worst. I grabed my cash on hand and nothing else but the pets seemed that important. Days of fear were ahead as the cat 5 hurricane was heading right for me. After a long wait and the cone of uncertainty was lifting i sat back and relaxed alittle more as my house and property was in disarry. As days passed i started to put things back together. I wasnt untill days later i woke up in the middle of the night and wondered what i had done with my envelope of money. my memory was shaded, i looked upon myself in motion and was stuck on holding it and nothing else was recalled.  I eventually went to a clinical hypnotist to help track my movement to help recall what happen to the envelope. i discovered that my cat whom jumped on the counter had knocked it into a black garbage bag that was at the doorway. I also had a pair of pliars that i was using to get the shutters lifted up.  i am still in shock. thousands of dollars in the garbage. im besides myself to think of the chances that happened and no hurricane winds were ever even felt!!!",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM9UFPL6
