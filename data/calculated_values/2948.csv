SO many of our family and friends came around for the wedding party. It was a real wonderful event and so many people was around. At some point, it stared looking like some family and friend reunion. Quite a lot of people have seen themselves for so long and it provided an opportunity to reunite. The moment of couple dance was a very emotional moment for us. My wife and her dad cried profusely. I was happy since it was a happy parting moment. Our family and friends danced a lot with us. The wedding party was the beginning of a great wonderful thing together. We have grown so fond of one another and we do so many things together. We will be having a kid soon and we are looking forward to this. I hope it would be a girl because I have always wanted one. I understand that it is a new phase entirely and I look forward to this. I hope we stay together forever.",3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMPS9LP8,
