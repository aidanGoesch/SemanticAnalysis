I had a few stressful events happen. I was driving and almost got hit. I remained calm during the whole process. The other person ran a red light. I hope he got a ticket because of it. Later that day, I tripped while walking outside. I landed just short of some glass. I was lucky that I didn't get cut. The last stressful event that day was while eating. I choked on some steak. I coughed it up. I was a bit mad but got over it. I learned that you need to be cool during bad times. You will survive if you do this. I hope I don't have to do any of these things again.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMXHGLP1
