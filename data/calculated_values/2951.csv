Suddenly the men in charge of the suits were no where to be found. the car to take us to the next city was faulty. it was like the end of the world. the men in charge of the suits were drunk. but with time they woke up. they met up with the wedding. our panic was over. it showed that sometimes you have no choice against actions. Not every situations needs our actions. we just have to be calm.  life brings challenges. it takes diligence. calmness in every situation is needed. it was a nice experience. i learnt a lot from it.  i have learnt to always  be calm,,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMXHGLP1
