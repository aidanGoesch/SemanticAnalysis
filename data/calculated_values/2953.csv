It was totally unexpected on my side, which is probably part of the reason it has hit me so badly. We had been together for about 9 months and it was long distance, but there was never really issue with jealousy or trust. I knew he had female friends, and he knew I had male friends, and it was never an issue. He is in Indonesia, and I am in America, so we talked through WhatsApp but our timezones often left us asleep/awake at opposite times and we only had a few hours each day to talk. We spoke through voicechat, videochat, and text messages. One morning about 3 weeks ago now, I woke up to a text message written in a different style than he writes that said something like ""I already have a girlfriend, don't talk to me again. Goodbye."" I was obviously very surprised and confused and I asked him to explain and he said a female friend of his had taken his phone and written that because she was jealous. I said that was very strange and obviously she wanted to date him and he said no, they were just friends and she was being mean. I accepted that and moved on, but then about a week later it happened again, but this time when I told him about the messages he said that she had gotten jealous and confessed that she had feelings for him, and he felt the same, so he wanted to be with her and he and I would just be friends. It was shocking for many reasons because I had believed him when it happened the first time and told him she wanted to date him; he had known her for a long time, so why now; and I found it hard to understand how he would leave me for someone who was purposely trying to hurt me with the way she pretended to be him and say mean things to me. He wanted to stay friends, and I tried, but she began to control his life, and continued to say mean things to me while pretending to be him, blocked me on his phone, and got angry with him for playing a game with me on his phone. I feel like he's in an abusive relationship, and I know real life is easier than long distance, but I still am struggling with heartbreak and pain, and I've even caught a cold. I don't understand why he would leave me for her. We never fought, and it seems like he fights with her everyday. We occasionally speak through the game, but I got my hopes up the other day, so now I'm trying to keep a distance. It's really hard and sad and I love him.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMYBQLP0
