The VP had just visited our department and complimented me on how great we were doing.  Out of nowhere I'm called into my bosses office and we are no longer and most of us were let go from the company.  They had decided they could outsource our positions at a much lower cost. We are being allowed to apply for open positions within in the company and we are getting one weeks pay for every year we have been here with a minimum of 2 weeks pay.  I have only been with the company 3 years, I have 3 weeks to find a new job or things could get ugly. My wife is pregnant and she was thinking about quitting her job at least for a couple years so she can raise the baby.  She has been supportive but I feel like a failure if I force her to keep working.  All the plans we had are put on hold, I just hope we can make it without losing the house before I find a job. Why did this happen to me.  Was I really doing as good of job as I thought I was.  Did I cause all the others to lose their jobs?  Why wouldn't they come to me if they wanted to cut costs? How is this going to look on my resume'? What does my wife really think?  What do my employees think?  What did my boss really think of me?  I have way more questions then I do answers.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYLLP6
