My career and job that I love will be gone after this week. I can't believe after 17 years this is the end of it and that it happened so fast. It has been a rough few days letting my employees know that in one week their lives are changing drastically. Some of them are out of a job. Some of them are moving on to new positions and locations and some are retiring. Things will never be the same again. I am one of the lucky ones that was offered a position to stay. Although I am not sure I can stay and do a good job for the company with how I feel right now and not to mention the $5/hr pay cut I will be taking. I am fortunate that my family does not depend on my income and we will be ok either way. Not all are blessed as I am. Before anyone can move on, we need to pack up and tie up all loose ends. It's a hard thing to ask of everyone, given the situation but the company has made it clear that our severance packages will be in jeopardy if we don't. Today is last day that we will do business as usual so that we have the rest of the week to pack up. Today is the last day I will do what I've been doing for as long as I can remember. I feel sad. I feel disappointed. I am going to miss my job and my employees. All of these feelings are going to need to wait until another day. Today, we have a job to do. Today is the beginning of the end.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYLLP6
