I was so overwhelmed, I wasn't sure what I was going to do cause rebuilding a transmission is so expensive and I risk more going wrong with the car. My family finally talk me in to financing my first car. I mean if I am going to throw a few thousand towards fixing a transmission I might as well get a new car, it made sense. I go to the dealer ship with the car I had in mind I'd want to finance. The car was sitting on the lot, I was excited, my first ever financed car. I go for a test drive, everything seemed to be perfect. I get the car home after what seemed like an eternity, filling out paper work. I'm excited, I call my friends and we go for a drive to show off my new financed car. It was everything I wanted and more. I figured since this car was new I would not have anymore problems as far as transportation was concerned. Then I get the call that struck my heart in a sad way. I get a call from the dealership telling me he canceled my contract and I must return this car immediately! Turns out, he canceled my contract because he was a crooked dealer who lied to the bank about my income. I was hurt by this. I returned the car and ended up having to refinance a car that was not of my choice and impacted my credit score. Not only has it impacted my credit score but my payments I was making before the refinancing was a lot less than what I am paying now.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYNPLC
