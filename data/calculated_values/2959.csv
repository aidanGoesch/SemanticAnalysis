I financed my first car. My very first car that I got when I was 16 was 1995 Toyota Camry. The price tag was a whooping three hundred dollars, all of which was paid in cash by me. That car lasted three solid years. In those three years I changed the oil once. Yes, you read that right, one time. The car was amazing. All of this back story was to lead us here. The day my first car died was a tragic one. I didn't know what to do. I had no money for a down payment. I had barely any credit history (we're talking less than a month). I decided to go to Snap and Drive and boy did they screw me over. That place sucks! An interest rate of 20. 99%? On a car!?!? That is ridiculous. Not only did I finance my first car I am not looking into how I can refinance my first car. Please someone teach me how to be an adult. This sucks.",3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYNPLC,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYNPLC
