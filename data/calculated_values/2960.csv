This time we decided to go out and see some bands perform. This was different because we haven't really been to a concert. This is about as close as i've ever been to one. I thought it would be fun however. we went out and had some drinks watched a few bands perform live. we had a pretty good time we were all jamming and lifted. The only problem is something should be done to get to the good part. It takes a while for the bands to actually start playing. That's the best part drinking and listening just the time waiting beforehand is an issue. Overall we had a good time and new experience.,,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5
