Too bad it took so long to get! I could have gone on the camping trip with my friends if I could have just parallel parked correctly. But noooo! Dad won't let me go do thing alone with my friends until I can prove my independence. Get a driver's license and job. Well the job I got and now the license! No more smelling homeless people on the bus! There is still the small problem of my stupid fear of driving in general, but that will go away with time. The fact that I got the license seems to have helped in that department, but I'll feel better when I get some more interstate miles under my belt. Heck, I will be the life of the party because now I'll be the one driving us all up to the camping spots! Dave is going to be so jealous! And my sister too. Oh man, dad better not make me drive her everywhere! Anyways, one step closer to being an adult done!",,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYI6B7KDK
