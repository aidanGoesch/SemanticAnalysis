It was a beautiful sunny morning and my husband came home from work to watch our son while I went to take my drivers license test! I have been afraid of getting my license after being a passenger in a very bad accident. It was a head on collision at 60 mph. That accident never left my mind and kept me from ever wanting to learn how to drive. I am very proud of myself for finally taking this step . I was quite worried I would fail and then be so upset with myself that I would never try again. I did manage to mess up by not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign but I still passed. I can now go where I want to go without needing anyone to drive me there. The sense of freedom I feel is crazy. I wish I had done this a long time ago. My son is the reason why I chose to go and get my license. I did mess up a bit on my practice drive with the driving instructor. He kept trying to control the pedals more then I needed him to . It made me nervous . He was not my usual instructor and to be honest I disliked him quite a bit. I am so happy I did all my practice drives with the other instructor. He did a great job teaching me so I could pass the test.,,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYI6B7KDK
