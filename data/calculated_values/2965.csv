The ups, the downs and everything in between. My beautiful bride and I have been married for two years now. Our anniversary is tomorrow and we're going on a fabulous date of dinner around Newport Harbor. As I reflect back, I think to how nervous I was to even ask her to marry me. I bought the ring five months before I actually asked her. I practiced what I would say for months and just couldn't work up the nerve. Finally, after all that, I popped the question. I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. And she said yes! She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn. We got married just one month later and the most beautiful service ever. We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Everyone was there, our parents, our friends and even Elvis made an apppearance! We stayed the Mirage just up the street and just had the most wonderful time. The last two years have just been so amazing, I can't wait to see what the future holds.",,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYIWF9KDK
