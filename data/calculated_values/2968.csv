It was not fun at all, and I almost threw up the whole ride. I could feel my body swinging right and left and right and left and it was not fun at all. I was almost throwing up the whole time.  My supervisor was there for me to console me, but that wasn't working at all. It didn't help one bit at all. Once we got to the highest point, I knew it was over. It was by far the most frightening part of the trip that happened. As we went down I am pretty sure I passed out. This was the worst ride in my life still to this day. As I am writing this I still get sick to my stomach. This was not really the ride for me and I knew it. I am actually embarrassed to go into work tomorrow because of what had happened. This is not what I want to be remembered by. I liked spending so much time with everyone, but now I can't. I hope this day just ends soon.",,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYIWFCDKG
