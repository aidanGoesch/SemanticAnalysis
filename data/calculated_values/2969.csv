I have heard so much about  the roller coaster and i'm dying to try it. I said no  way i wont be scared to death. I protested  shaking my  head but my boss would not let me. Everyone else and  friends at work greed to .   I  had no  choice to give  in.   I followed him unwillingly,   i was even more nervous when i saw  the CAUTION.  We entered  into  a room where we were directed and our seats shwn to us. I  SHUT my eyes seized both the seats so tightly that they ached. i heard people shouting excitedly, finally the  roller coaster moved.  slowly first then faster  and began  to pick up speed.  I felt my stomach turning upside down' my heart  was pounding  loudly i regretted  taking the ride on this scary thing. i screamed at the top of my voice  and my hair was flying widely in the air. it really drove me nuts,but everyone seemed exited  on  the  roller  coaster. My supervisor tried to console me but it didnt help at all.  It swung   to the left and to  the right and when it slid down from the highest peak, it was the most frightening part of the trip. The fifteen minutes ride on the roller coaster  was  like a  coaster.     I buried my face in my hands  because i thought the whole world   was spinning. It  was a great feeling after all that i have  conquered my fears  and  was able to survive the ride. it was scary but i would never forget  the event...",,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYIWFCDKG
