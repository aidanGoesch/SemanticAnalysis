After she died I felt empty and just didn't care about myself anymore. I stopped taking care of me. In May of 2019 my Mom was hospitalized and then had to go to an after hospital rehab. She was there for 18 days. I stayed with here the entire time, she was contagious so I could not leave. It was during this time that I had what I think of as an awakening. There was not much to do and I knew that I had to do something to keep myself strong. I started to exercise. Gradually I began to move. I did consider stopping but I pushed through and each day began to feel better. I also did word puzzles and had a book to read to try and stay mentally sharp. I helped my Mom with her exercises and we had long conversations. But all the while I exercised. While I was just sitting in a chair watching TV, while she was sleeping in the afternoon, I fit it in everywhere. By the time she was released I felt like a new person. This experience saved me.",3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO7QZGQP,
