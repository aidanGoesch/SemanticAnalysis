I had my coffee and made my breakfast.  I ate outside as it was sunny and cool at 7am and wanted to enjoy the view.  Everything was going perfect until the phone call.  I received a call from my boss asking if I had a few minutes to talk.  I said, ""of course"" thinking she might be asking me to work overtime one day next week, or possibly come in later that day.  That's when things went sour.  My boss advised me that he was not happy with the quality of my work.  He said that he is getting pressure from upper management and that he needed to put more pressure on his staff.  He said if I did not clean up my act that I would be out of a job within a couple weeks.  He was blunt and quick with the conversation and hung up before I could ask him any questions.  Just like that my perfect day took a turn for the worst.  I immediately starting thinking about my mounting bills and student loans.  I could feel my blood flowing through my arms and my chest.  I started to sweat as I thought about my rent, car loan, student loan, insurance cost and utility bills.  Before I even knew what was going on, I was slouched in my chair and having a panic attack.  I thought I was going to faint.  I was sweating and breathing heavily.  I ran to get a glass of water and was shaking and could barely drink it.  I called my mom to come over right away.  5 minutes felt like 5 hours as I thought about the mounting costs of going to the hospital.  The bills and cost of medication to help me through this time were going to pile up.  Eventually my mom drove me to the hospital and I got an IV and some anxiety medication.",,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO8DIGQJ
