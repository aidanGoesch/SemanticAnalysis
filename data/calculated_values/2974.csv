My son, who is a year old, was in the car so I immediately pulled over to try and calm myself down. When I was calm enough to drive home, I started calling around trying to find a psychiatrist. I am currently on Medicaid. All mental health providers have stopped taking medicaid patients for reasons that they will not disclose. I have had to pay out of pocket. My mental health provider who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. It has been a constant fight to maintain some sense of normalcy enough to balance the responsibilities in my life. My child depends on me and my life depends on my job. I work hard but between student loan debt and bills, I cannot afford regular insurance for myself and my son. My husband's job is no longer required to offer health plans to its employees. He has no insurance. He also suffers from clinical depression but cannot access the services he needs. It is ridiculous that two people who work full time have to rely on government insurance because they cannot afford a private provider. It is also ridiculous that health care providers can choose not to accept medicaid.",,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO8DIGQJ
