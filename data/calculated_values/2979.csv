We had lived together for six years. We had discussed marriage, engagement, and engagement rings over the last couple of years but neither of us felt pressure even though it was something we wanted to do eventually. I woke up from bed one morning and started to get ready. I took a shower and got dressed. He called me into the living room after that. I had no idea what he wanted but he asked me to sit down in the chair. He then got down on his knee, presented a ring, and asked me to marry him. Of course I said yes right away. He knows nothing about jewelry and I didn't think he was processing the things I had said about my ideal ring. I was wrong. The ring was perfect. The exact band, diamond cut, color, clarity, and carat. It all meant a lot to me and I love him very much. It wasn't about money it was about the fact that he had listened so well.",3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO9FUGQ0,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO9FUGQ0
