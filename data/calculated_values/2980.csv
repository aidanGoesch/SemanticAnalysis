It made it to where we didn't have to stress about making a schedule because we were able to just do whatever we wanted freely. It made me feel so happy having her there and knowing she loved me enough to be able to just show up when I least expected it. I couldn't of imagined a more perfect few days. I enjoyed everything we done together, even if it involved cleaning dishes from us trying to cook sometimes. I enjoyed being able to see the new movie we have been dying to see together but refused to watch it until we were both in the same place. It was astonishing opening the door when I heard an unexpected knock and she was there. I couldn't of asked for a better time. We took many pictures during this time together and we were able to make a scrap book at the end together before she left. Maybe next time I can surprise her. I am hoping she had as much fun as I did being here. I have never laughed so hard in my life than what I did having her here again. IT thrilled me to finally be able to see her face. I wanted to make sure she was always having fun when she was here so we were constantly doing stuff. We ended most of our nights on the roof looking at the stars. It was one of the greatest moments ever.",,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDOYFMGQH
