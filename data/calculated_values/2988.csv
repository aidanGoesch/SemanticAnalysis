He was turning 40. We realized none of us had been there since our youth so we figured that it couldn't be so bad. Oh were we wrong? When got into Tijuana pretty late on a Friday and the cops were already looking at us pretty suspiciously. It was pretty funny actually because even though it is a very tourists spot, we stuck out like sore thumbs. You could tell that nobody liked us and even the bartenders were a bit rude. My buddy John decided that we should try this ""other"" bar he had heard about. What we didn't know was that it was a well known brothel and known for trouble. When we got there a few men started acting a bit creepy towards us. Staring us and and making jokes in spanish. The man told us that we had to each pay for one woman, or we had to leave. We realized what he meant and we slowly backed out. A large man started grabbing my friend and of course we all helped him. Now we had about 20 angry guys and angry people. He said he was calling the cops. I told them all we needed to do. We hailed a cab JUST as Mexican police cars showed up. We told the Taxi to ""hurry up"" and we got back to the border quick. It was pretty scary but also funny to us.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H4GO95,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H4GO95
