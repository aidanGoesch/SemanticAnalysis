Of course, it's just so inconvenient, you know? How could he? He interrupted the one day out of the week I get to relax with my friends. I told her to wait a while and I'd be there, a few hours at the most. She started going on about how he was in critical condition and all that. Blah Blah Blah, you know? Who cares? I didn't want to piss off my friends, and, frankly, I was a little pissed off myself. We had at least a few hours left in our game, and, god, what's the point of staying if I'm not there with them? I couldn't just abandon them. What would they do without me? So, we stayed a little longer and played a little bit more golf. I went to the hospital after, my mother was hysterical. I was just a little annoyed, I went in to see my dad. He was fine, by the way, he just had a minor stroke. The doctors say he'll make a full recovery.",,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1OCMO9Y
