We took our cat. It was 2000 mile or so trip. Drove from boston to Connecticut. From there, we drove to PA, outside of Pittsburg. Then we went to Indianapolis, I think, which sucks. From there we went to Oklahoma. Then from there, finally, to NM, Santa Fe. We mostly ate fast food, and stayed at Motel 6. Drove 8 hours a day most days. It was certainly a journey, but we did it, and now I love where I live, though I'm still me, and struggling with some of the same things as when I lived in Boston, such as money, and being isolated. Still, this city is wonderful, and I love it. I would not ever want to live in Boston again. The people there are very mean. Also, the winter sucks. Yuck.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1PZ99OH,
