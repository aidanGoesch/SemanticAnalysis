Santa Fe, specifically. The journey was 2,500 miles, and we drove. We took out cat with us, in a large dog crate we purchased, after we read about a lot of animals dying on plane rides. We split the journey into 8 hour days. We would stop and get food on the road, most of the time. We drove west. The sun was constantly in our eyes. We drove through PA, OH, Indiana, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas. It was fun, but definitely the most enjoyable part was when we got out of middle America. We went to motel 6, because they allow pets. Our cat did surprisingly well. She slept for most of the journey. This event was significant to me because it signaled a new era in my life. It signaled a new time for me, and an attempt to be truly happy for my later years, though I am only in my 30s.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1PZ99OH,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1PZ99OH
