They are my sister's first children, and I was so excited when she announced she was pregnant and I would be an aunt.  It was a huge shock when we learned she was having twins!  When they were born, I went to the hospital to visit with them.  I didn't stay long, even though she and her husband were exhausted.  They wanted to spend time alone as a new family.  I will never forget holding the babies for the first time.  My niece especially was tiny.  They were both premature, but she was only 5 pounds.  My nephew was a little bit bigger and seemed stronger.  We were all so grateful that there were no complications or health issues, which I learned can be common with twins.  They were both so perfect and tiny.  I was like holding tiny dolls.  I will never forget that day.  I love them more than I ever expected I would.",,3018Q3ZVOJCZJFDMPSFXATCQG04RAI
