I remember these six months well, because there were a lot of life changes that I had to make and throughout the months I learned more and more about myself than I did last year. Within the last six months, I moved out of my parents' house for the first time; I had a lot of anxiety moving out (especially since I have an anxiety disorder, among other mental illnesses) and the fact that I had to do it suddenly made the anxiety worse. My boyfriend's roommates decided out of the blue that they were going to move out and there was a risk that him and another friend of our would be homeless. Now, at that point in my life I had a part-time job that paid well enough that I could move in and pay rent -- I had expected to movie in with my boyfriend by May when their lease was up but the past roommates decided to move out in February.  Thus, I was not as mentally prepared and had a lot of trouble coming to terms with the fact that I needed to move out of my parents house eventually. I am 24 years old and struggled with severe depression for a large portion of my life. Some times I feel that I am still struggling but since I had moved that struggle became less and less severe. I have gotten to the point where I have a good handle of my anxiety and depression and try to push past them. This came with the move, as my previous home environment was very hostile: my parents fought and argued all the time. Thinking about it, they have always been fighting since I had remember, and moving out was a right step in the direction to get out of that toxicity. I still struggle with my mental illnesses but they became less and less significant and more manageable than I ever felt before. I knew getting out of a toxic environment was a path to better mental health but I didn't realize how beneficial it was until got out of it. Within the past six months I have lost weight, nearly 10lbs, and have a much more positive head space. Because of this, I was able to eat healthier, stop stress eating, start exercising, being more social, etc. A lot of positive things happened that still affect me significantly to this day. As for my parents... well, I love them very much and it was heartbreaking to see my mother cry when I started packing up and moving out. My mom loved me dearly and she would do anything for me and my brother; however, I needed to leave the nest. I do visit often, I try to keep in touch at least once  or twice a week. Unfortunately I've been doing this less often lately because every time I go there the fighting and arguing continues. I addressed this problem before but my parents didn't quite understand why I was so upset by this. It also didn't help that there was a language barrier and they were born in another country. Since there was no way for me to stop the arguing I had to be the one to leave. It was a hard decision but I'm much happier for it.",,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1Q25O9Z
