One day my friend called me up and we planned a beach trip together. We took the time to gather all the needed info. All we needed to do was rent a car, book the room, and wait. Up until the day of the planned vacation I packed and planned what to do beforehand. The day finally came, we headed to the car rental place to pick up the vehicle. Transferred all our belongings into the car and we were on our way. I was so thrilled and relieved to be leaving town and having a getaway! After a four hour drive we arrived. We went grocery shopping our first night so we could cook to save some money while down there. During our stay we went shopping for clothes, rode on a speedboat, ate several restaurants, rode on a skywheel, and just relaxed while looking at the ocean. I would say the speedboat was the most memorable experience. It packed a nice punch of adrenaline and that was just what I needed to take my mind off of the stress. I enjoyed every minute of it. I cannot wait to go back!",,3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NN7XCF93
