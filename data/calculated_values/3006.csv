I had not done my final project for the class and there were only a few days left to complete it.  This was extremely stressful and bothered me greatly. The class was online and I had no reason to try hard throughout the first part of the class, nor did I have anyone looking over my shoulder to encourage me to try harder.  I found myself in a severe time crunch.      The class was a video creation course and we were tasked with creating a video through shorts created from our own cameras.  The video would have to show off our technical capabilities with Premier Pro, which is Microsoft video editing software.       I had only 2 days to create and edit a film.  It was a daunting task.   I went though several thoughts including dropping out, and giving up.  I decided that it was my fault I was in the time crunch, and I had to get started and turn in something at the very least.  The film had to be made. Of course the film also had to make sense as well and have a story. I had created nothing over the last few months, nor did I have any clue of what to do to start with. After brainstorming I had a idea! I quickly found some old footage of me driving a truck from a dash cam, then created a story based on places I had seen or been, I added some background music, and a voice over, and amazingly succeeded in creating a solid project for my class.   I ended up with a great grade but I attribute that to my abilities to perform under pressure and creativity ,not my sense of time management.",,3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NNV8XF9Y
