I wasn't sure what it was and it was dark and deserted out.  I didn't feel safe getting out of the car to check.  I kept driving until I got home.  I couldn't sleep that night thinking I might have run over and killed an animal.  In the morning when I checked my wheels, I saw blood stains on the wheel and underneath the car.  I was sure I had killed something on the road.  I felt really guilty about it.  It was an accident but it was still not something I could like with easily.  My psychiatrist has been helping me sort through my feelings and prescribed anti-depressants.  He's afraid I would slip into a deep depression.  I had just gotten off the drugs but he thought I should get back on them, given the accident.  I took the drugs again.  They numbed my feelings.  I could get by with school and work.  It helped to stay busy.",,3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NNXYJ9FW
