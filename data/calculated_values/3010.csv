He originally said it would be just for a little while, but he ended up being here for just about 3 years. He has never lived alone, and has ended up moving back into his mother's house. Things have not gone well since. He has been telling lies to people about us and the situation to our mutual friends. Even to my fiance's mother. He even said we sponged off of him! And my fiance told him we can still all be friends. The guy told everyone that my fiance ended a 20 year friendship though of course. Nobody believes him though, because he is generally a moody and miserable person. We should have known that inviting that into your home is a bad idea, but he was our friend and wanted to help him. Since he's been gone though, it has been much nicer here. We are once again free to do as we please and walk around in our underwear lol. We don't have to walk on eggshells, and there's not a big dark cloud looming around. It's sad how he is, but it seems that we can't help him.",3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NNY0Q9F8,
