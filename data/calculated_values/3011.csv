About 3 years ago we let one of my fiance's friends he's had since high school stay with us. There was no bedroom available, so he made a room for himself out of furniture and bedsheets in the large 'man cave' that is adjacent to the living room. I was slightly apprehensive about it because I knew he was a little moody at times, but agreed because he was our friend and would be paying us $200 in rent per month. For the first year or so things were going nicely, we were all happy (as far as I know), and friendly. Spending time together, helping each other out when needed, etc. But as time went on, our friend/roommate became more miserable. His job started early, so he wanted to come home and take naps at 3-4 in the afternoon, and that is a difficult thing to do when you are in a room made out of sheets, and there are two toddler boys in the next room. Also, the boys and I are always home, because I cannot drive, we live on a highway so it's not safe to walk anywhere, and my fiance is always at work, so it was like this every day. I don't work because daycare in the area I live for 2 toddlers cost more than what I made at my job! So this was happening every day. In addition to that, our friends would come over and stay late, and they were his friends too. Usually 1 to 2 times per week. So I guess he wasn't getting enough sleep. I say I guess, because this man, in addition to being moody, is very passive aggressive. So instead of talking to us about his issues, he would just walk by in silence, ignore me if I said hello to him, and just generally be bitter. He wasn't like that all the time though. Sometimes he would be like that, and just a few hours later be kind and talkative. So over time, he became more and more bitter and confusing, helping us out like friends less and less, and isolating himself more and more. And was friendly mostly when he was drunk. Eventually he started blaming me for my children being loud in the day, and even telling them to shut the f--- up sometimes! So about two weeks ago the situation came to its head, and my fiance had it. He told him that he has been mean to us and our children, a bad friend, and that he needs to move out. It is sad, because they have been friends since they were 15, and I know he will hold animosity towards us. I feel bad for him though, because he always has these kinds of problems with people.",3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NNY0Q9F8,3HL8HNGX46NOB6Y86R13X9NNY0Q9F8
