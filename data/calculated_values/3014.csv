It seemed like every other day except now i know i have no father because he is gone. The funeral was a sea of people. Most of which i dont remember all saying the same things countless people told me it will get better, How would they know Most them still have there fathers and mother . Why do people think its okay to say something that they dont know is true just because it sounds nice .Today I thought abut all the things that I didnt say to my father. The last time i seen him he wanted to take a picture with my son but i lied and said my phone was about to die thats something that i will carry for the rest of my life. I was embarrassed by his drug use I was embarrassed by  how he looked so i lied. That could of been a moment but i denied it because of my bitterness. My son will never know how he grandpa wanted to take a picture with him because i will never tell him because im ashamed.  Why did I stay angry for so long. Why didnt I take the dam picture. I hate myself because of it.  I didnt cry today because I didnt want to. I didnt want to feel anything. How dare you die dad. How dare you leave me with so much guilt. I deserve it though.",3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9SV8YB,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9SV8YB
