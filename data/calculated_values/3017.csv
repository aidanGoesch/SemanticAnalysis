The contractions started the day before while we were out shopping for last minute things. I tried not to let them bother me to much. That night I started getting lower back pain but paid it no mind. I got an ice pack and heating pad but neither relieved the deep pain. By morning I was ready to go to the hospital. when we got there I was already at 6 cm. It just seems like things went faster after that. I got an epidural which took away most of the pain. I felt a little guilty since I said I wanted to do it naturally. When it came time to push it didn't take long. maybe 5 minutes and my son was finally here. We stayed in the hospital 2 days before coming home. He was a good baby didn't cry much. He was fine not being held when I needed a break.,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9XDY8T,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9XDY8T
