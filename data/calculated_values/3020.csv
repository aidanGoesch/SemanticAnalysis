My parents would never let me have one as a kid. My dad wasn't a fan of pets and didn't want to take care of them or clean up after them. Now as an adult, I decided it was time to finally get that dog that I've always wanted. About three weeks ago I went to the city shelter and looked at all of the dogs. I saw a few that I liked, but I fell in love with a pitbull. I never pictured myself as a pitbull owner, but I absolutely had to leave with this pitbull. He's such a sweetheart, but people are so intimidated by him. When I'm walking my dog down the street, people will avoid me. Sometimes they even cross the street to get as far away as possible. Bystanders have commented that she is such an intimidating looking dog! They clearly don't know her like I know her. Not everybody is so judgmental, though. On on occasion, shortly after I brought her home, the local public utility workers took a liking to her. They saw me struggling with some plumbing work outside of my house. It was a 90 degree day and I didn't really know what I was doing. I was sweating, exhausted, and getting nowhere fast. They commented on what a great dog I had and then offered to help me out with my chore. After hours of struggling, we were able to get the task done in 15 minutes! It was such a heart-warming act of kindness and I can't help but think that I have my pitbull to thank.",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSIG48Y5
