I knew that I wanted to adopt a dog from my city shelter, as I believe they engage in remarkable work taking care of the city's abandoned animals.  I left that day with my 7 year old female pitbull, and my life has not been the same since that day.   I truly believe that adopting my dog has made me a better, more self-less person.  I have had to make adjustments in my daily life in order to take care of her, but it's not a struggle or an inconvenience (well, maybe it is, but I haven't seen it that way).  Owning a pitbull has been an interesting social development. As we walk down the street, some folks will look at her with an obvious discomfort.  I have had people remark that they don't want to get to close because they don't ""want their face ripped off,"" or will ask me ""is that one of those mean fighting dogs?""  Even though I've known about the stigma of owning a pitbull, it's still a little awkward and shocking to handle these interactions.  I always try to do the best I can in the fleeting passing moments to share that she's a kind animal.  That being said, there is an abundance of activity in my neighborhood, primarily of the construction and public utility variety.  For context, I live in an area of incredible heat and humidity.  I often am concerned for the workers and their conditions.  So imagine my surprise when, one day, I am walking my dog and the construction workers come over to pet her and share their water with her on one of the hottest days of the year.  It was a gesture that was so sweet and heartwarming.  It really made me appreciate human kind and the ability for people to share and care for others.  So often when we go on our walks, I do my best to stay out of people's way and give them the room they need to feel safe.  It was so nice to have a positive social interaction with my dog and the workers.  Now every day when we go on walks they call out to her and give her pets.",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSIG48Y5
