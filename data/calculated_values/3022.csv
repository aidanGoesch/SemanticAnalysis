I've received the best gift life could ever give me in the form of my beautiful baby boy, Mateo. I still remember how lost and scared I felt when the pregnancy test I took came up positive. I just stood there thinking, ""I always wanted to be a mother, but am I really ready for all of this? I know it's selfish to feel this way, but it's not going to be all about me anymore."" I was so scared that I even contemplated giving him up for an adoption early on in the pregnancy, but that all changed once I had my first ultrasound. Three months ago....one bright and early Thursday morning...I began to feel strong contractions and instantly knew Mateo was ready to make his entrance into this world. I quickly called out to my sister and told her it was time. The trip to the hospital was a blur, I kind of felt like I was in a trance...almost losing my grip on reality. I finally came to once I was on the hospital bed and getting ready to push. The pain was so intense and again the doubtful thoughts began to come to my mind, ""Are you really ready for this? Are you really ready to be a mother and handle all that comes with it?"" Before more questions could continue racing through my mind, my body instantly took over and I felt a sudden urge to push. I pushed and pushed for what seemed like an eternity and boy was it painful! I felt so tired and thought I couldn't push anymore until the nurse yelled out, ""Keep going! His head is right there!"" I pushed with the last bit of energy I had left in me and Mateo made his grand entrance. The nurse placed him in my arms and....I know it's so cliche to say, but I instantly fell in love with him. Three months ago, I became a mother for the very first time to the most beautiful human being in this world and I am so grateful for that. I still have days where I wake up to self-doubting thoughts. It's not easy being a first-time mom and trying to navigate this new journey. But one thing's for sure, I know that I love being his mother and knowing that each day I get to wake up to be the best mother than I can be than I was the day before.",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSJ3OY8Q
