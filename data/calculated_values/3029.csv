It was one of my favorite hobbies. It allowed me to express creativity. But when I got a job it gave me less time to work on my bass guitar. So I was unable to practice it and participate in music activities for a long time. It took several years, but eventually I was able to make time for it. I had to make compromises with my work and the church I play with. I also gave up some of my other free time in order to play bass to stay consistent. It also allowed me to become more skilled at it. It made me appreciate my bass guitar and appreciate my own free time. This is a sad memory for me. Im glad I was able to think about this memory again. A hobby is something you should not take for granted. Life is meant to enjoy the little things. Happiness and fufilling your life.",3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSK6GY8P,
