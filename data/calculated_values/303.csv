Three weeks ago I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight, and met met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet lagged since she came from the United States but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities, but regardless, I found them very relaxing.  This trip was amazing overall, I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends. I hadn't seen her for almost a year so it was really great to catch up and kind of share with her a little bit of my chaotic life of when I was working in Europe.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD37FED1,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD37FED1
