Because of work, I had to stop play bass guitar for a while to focus on other things. Time passed by and I rarely played my bass guitar while other things in life took priority. Throughout those years I always missed playing bass guitar and wanted to get back into it. It was sad to abandon a hobby like that. I felt like it was a talent that I was abandoning and some way I can both have fun and express my creativity. Just recently I decided to get back into playing bass guitar and very happy to be playing. I was playing for my church, but because of my absence not able to play. But because I am able to play again and able to play at my church. I regret choosing to not play for those several years. There was a specific event that made me want to play again with a gathering of other musicians that made me want to play again and inspired me. One of the bass guitar players inspired me to play again. Later on, i bought a new bass guitar because I was inspired to do so. I also plan to buy a 5 string bass guitar because my current bass guitars are only 4 string. I also plan to not abandon my hobby again and will work around it.",3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSK6GY8P,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSK6GY8P
