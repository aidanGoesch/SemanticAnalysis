It's been two months since we opened our business in this wonderful location, and everything is going wonderfully.  But I have to keep reminding myself that it could have turned out very differently.  Every time I start to remember the horrible weeks leading up to the grand opening, I have an almost irresistible urge to go find Douglas (the hubby and other half of the business) and give him a big hug and a smacking big kiss for being such a rock through it all.  First, 4 weeks before the date, the landlord contacted us to say he thought there might be an unforeseen termite problem with the property.  Then a week later, no termites, just water damage, but might need to postpone tenancy.  Great, since our current lease at the time was due to expire and we had to get our stock and everything out of the store.  Then our movers went out of business.  Next, our suppliers  contacted us to say they were having problems with labor and shipping, and could we wait eight weeks for delivery.  The answer to that was a definite no, and I went power shopping to find new suppliers and fallback shipping.  Before I got new suppliers lined up I was tempted to just chuck it all in.  But Douglas got our friends to pitch in, we found an alternate location, new movers,new suppliers, an army of friends to help, and it actually happened.    The opening went off without a hitch, business is booming.  Life is good.  Out of disaster came the best business move we ever made.  This weekend, the best thank you party for friends!",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4AYY1B
