She was a heavier girl with greasy hair and clothes that were obviously hand me downs or thrift store buys. I knew that she most likely didn't have the best life, based on the way that she acted. She would constantly curse or make sex jokes or jokes about drugs, and at 13 it seemed like she was trying too hard to prove she was mature. While her life was probably a string of bad parenting mistakes and school punishments from lashing out, but it still didn't excuse her severe bullying. She would lean against her locker and glare at me as I passed by, calling out mean questions like, ""Do you have a dick?"" or ""Why are you staring at me, you fucking lesbian?"" I wasn't the only one she tormented. I would hear her lashing out at other girls, and even some of the more timid boys. Her favorite insults to hurl at the boys were often ""Faggot!"" or ""Pussy!"" Because of her aggressive behavior, she didn't have many friends but that doesn't mean that she didn't have any. Her wannabe gang was comprised of two other girls and one boy, all of which seemed to have been brought up in less than fortunate circumstances. Their crew was known for smoking pot, vandalizing, and being in detention. About 6 months ago, I finally stood up to my bully. We were in P.E. and all of the girls were in the locker room. It was mandatory to change into gym clothes before P.E. started. Everyone faced inward toward their locker, trying to block out the rest of the half naked girls. Except for my bully, who turned toward me and pulled down the elastic waistband of my gym shorts, then loudly exclaimed, ""My bad, just wanted to finally see once and for all if you really did have a dick"", while she laughed sarcastically. I straightened up, with my shorts still down around my knees and quietly breathed out, ""We all know you just act out because you have a shitty life."" The girls around me quietly giggled. My bully turned away, looking hurt. I thought she'd lash out, but the public embarrassment seemed to actually bother her.A few hours later, when we were all waiting for the buses around the back of the school, my bully came up to me. ""Hey, dickwad.""""...Hey."" I said back.""That wasn't cool, what you did before - you don't know my life, bitch.""""You're right I don't know your life... but I'm just calling how everyone sees it. Why do you think everyone laughed when I said it.""It seemed to dawn on her that the way she had been acting wasn't funny or cool, and was actually contributing to her loneliness. The rest of the school year, she didn't call out mean things to people passing by or get a detention so she seemed to have taken what I said to heart and actually tried to change her behavior.",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD38PDEC
