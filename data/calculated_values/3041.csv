I remember i was in the emergency room about to give labor to my new child.  While i was giving birth my mother was at my home that was near by.  While she was there she ended up stealing some things that were inside of my home. I was very unhappy with her for doing this. I felt that she betrayed our family by stealing while i was giving birth to my new daughter. I felt very betrayed that she would do such a  thing especially while i was giving birth. It was a very sad time for my family.  We all felt that she was a very bad mother to do this to me. I have chosen to not talk to her anymore since she did this. I feel it will be a long time before i talk to her again.  She has tried to call me but i have chose to block her number.  For the time being i will need time before i talk to her again. I will talk to her.  But for now we are on a no speaking terms.,,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCKV0PY19
