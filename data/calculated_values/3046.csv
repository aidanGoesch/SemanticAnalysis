When i realized that i would come up short i had to try brain storm ideas that would help me. Eventually i realized that i would not have the money at the time i needed to pay my bill. For some reason the electric bill was 200 hundred dollars. I live in an apartment building and had not used the air conditioning unit at all that month. The reason for it being that high is a mystery to me. When i lived in a house the bill was not that much. I can not think of a time where the bill for the electric got to this much. I had to find someone who would give me money for the bill. I decided to ask my brother for the money. I went to his house and asked him. I talked about my problem and he said he would help me. when i went over there to get the money he didn't have it. I was pretty upset so i had to come to terms with being without power. I was thinking of ways that i could survive without power. Eventually my brother came through so i didn't have to go through that. I was so happy i almost cried.,,3HOSI13XH0A3GCXTR1BFV53SD8ZDDS
