It was just a stupid mistake. and only by $1.45. I couldn't afford for this to happen at all. as I'm right in the middle of a financial crisis. I took a cash deposit up to the bank to cover it. but for some reason it didn't. The overdraft posted anyway. I'm terribly distressed about this. Now I don't have all the money to pay my bills. The utilities are in danger of being disconnected. and I already owe back rent. Little good things have been happening for me, but it seems like for every good thing that happens, two or three bad things happen. I'm so frustrated with my life right now. I feel very hopeless right now. Things like this",,3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVB010CY6
