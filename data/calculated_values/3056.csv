It was holiday time, My kids and i have been curious about what we will be doing for the holiday. so we were all giving suggestion on what to to or where to do. My eldest kid who hasnt spend much time away from home suggested we go camping and we all agreed. We chose going to the camping site few kilometers outskirt the cities. It was a beautiful weekend and we packed our bags and our camping equipment such as tent, hunting gun, boots, googles, water bottle. It was about 3hrs drive from the city and we got there late in the evening. we pitched our tent and walked around. We fet few families who also came camping and we introduced oursleves. We started to choose our activities in the camp as we have planned to get the most out of the five days camping. we chose hunting  first and other activities followed. Every night we  make camp fires before going to bed. Two days into camping, we started hearing gunshot in the evening. Everyone was scared and i armed myself to protect myself and my kids. We were curious until the rangers came by and told us everything is okay that it could be deer hunters or so. We were told we are secured and that was how we were able to sleep during night. it was such an interesting camping and we all enjoyed it because we had a nice time meeting few families too.",,3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVBAWJCYP
