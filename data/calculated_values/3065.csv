One of my favorite director is Stanley Kubrick. I live in the suburbs and the movie theaters around here tend to only play the big stuff. All the cool indie films I have to travel 45+ minutes to go see. I was checking the movie times to see if anything good was playing when, to my surprise, they were actually showing The Shining, one night only, at 7pm. I think The Shining is one of the coolest movies made, and possibly the best horror film ever made. I've only ever seen it on tv and on my dvd. The dvd picture quality is kind of shit to be honest. Kubrick died in 1999 and I was too young to have seen Eyes Wide Shut in theater. Now finally I had a chance to see The Shining in person. So I finally got to see it. It was a bundled promotion as there is a new movie coming out called Dr Sleep that is a sequel to The Shining. Couldn't care less, just happy to see the real deal. It was magnificent. It had been newly remastered in 4k and it was simply awesome.  The picture quality was so bright and sharp while maintaining the wonderful film grain. Most surprising was how damn loud it was. The score kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. All movies should be experienced on the big screen, especially the great ones, and The Shining is a masterpiece.",,3HQUKB7LNG01487XZTDVDBXO6MXHHN
