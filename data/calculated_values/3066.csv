My baby's leaving the nest. So many mixed feelings! The thing I'm focusing on right now is remembering her high school graduation. It was 4 months ago but, Diary, it feels like a lifetime ago! I remember every little detail just like it was yesterday, though! When we heard Kim was valedictorian, we were so proud we thought we'd burst! Our little girl, giving the valedictorian speech! Believe it or not, I actually shook from excitement while I was helping her into her gown. Before I knew it, we drove into the school parking lot and were making our way to the field. Both hubby and I couldn't resist giving her one last hug before she took her place with the other graduates. Her speech was amazing. She's always been an awesome writer, and her words inspired the crowd so much they jumped to their feet for a very loud, and very unexpected, standing ovation! We were so proud, and so thankful to have such a talented and wonderful child. We're so lucky. We're going to visit her at college tomorrow, and I'm sure I'll be back to tell you all about it! Love,Sandra",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631RTM0Y
