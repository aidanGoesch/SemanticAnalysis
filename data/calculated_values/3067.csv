She was the valedictorian of her class. While months prior her teachers had indicated she might hold the title, there were still some other students who were being considered. Even when she first told me that she was being considered at all, I felt very proud of her. I told her how pleased I was, and it was fine if she wasn't their final choice. When the decision was final, I was in a state of slight shock. I knew she was a bright, well-behaved child, but to be in that position was quite an honor to me. I thought about how young I was when I had her and how I was determined that her childhood would be more nurturing than mine had been. I thought about how I raised her as a single parent and how everyone had something negative to say when it became clear that I would raise her on my own. It was like God was talking to that scared young woman that I was, telling her (me), ""It will all work out well for you and her."" With all this in mind, I attended her graduation. Even though I had heard her practice her speech beforehand, watching her walk up to the stage and humbly delivering her speech was earth-shaking to me. It was certainly one of the most special moments of my life. It wasn't just that she was in the valedictorian position, which alone was wonderful, but she had beaten the odds. I floated the whole day. I had previously hoped that recording the event would stop me from crying, but it did not. I felt so grateful to watch something so beautiful. Even typing this now makes me misty-eyed.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631RTM0Y
