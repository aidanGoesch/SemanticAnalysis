I was rushing through the grocery store that day, I was running late for work, but I needed to stop to grab meds for my husband, yes my husband. I hit the corner of the isle so fast that I didnt even see him, my soulmate that is, I walked right into him. As I said sorry, we made eye contact, and when i looked into his eyes, I felt like I knew this man my entire life, and what was crazier was that he looked at me the same way. He was a normal looking guy, not overly attractive, just nice looking. He smiled and I smiled and he said dont worry about it, we survived right? We ended up standing in this isle for 15 minutes talking, he was an investment banker, his name was Michael, and he had a dog named Nala. We both were married and we both have kids. The conversation ended with a goodbye and a take it easy. No numbers exchanged, no plans on ever meeting again. The look in eyes matched the feeling I felt, the feeling i felt was that I was supossed to meet that man, we were meant to cross paths, I dont know why but we were meant to meet. I love my family and I would never ruin what I already have, but I felt something talking to this person that I have never felt with another person in my life. Now weeks have passed and I still think of this guy and wonder what the reason was we crossed paths. Like I said im amarried woman and I would never do anything to comprimise my marriage or my family, but there was just something about this man, and meeting him. It makes me wonder what life really has in  store for me sometimes, we never really know what were all doing to begin with. Maybe one day this encounter will make sense.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631RV0ME
