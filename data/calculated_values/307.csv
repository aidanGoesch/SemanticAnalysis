I wanted to go somewhere less touristy and with more culture, but Tom has wanted to visit the Bahamas ever since his best friend Alex went with her husband. I acquiesced, of course, because I'll do anything to make Tom happy. And he was. He was in Heaven for that entire week. And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find out, was I.The resort was the most luxurious accommodation I have ever experienced. We didn't have to lift a finger for the whole week. New drinks were brought to us at the moment our glasses had become dry. The beach and the water were so beautiful. The water was a vivid turquoise color, just like you see in the commercials. The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, and I found it contagious. My favorite event was the carnival that we attended a few miles away from the resort. There were so many elaborate costumes, amazing food, and live music. Coming home from the trip, I felt utterly relaxed and rejuvenated. I will cherish the memories from this trip forever.",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDA1CDES
