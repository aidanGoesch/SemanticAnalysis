That Competition  name is  Scottish dances. It is My Favorite Competition. I am participate the Competition. I am preparing Very Well in this Dance Competition. My performance is Very Well in this Dance Competition. It is My Dream. Despite a car accident the night before, I was alive and well to play and dance at the annual English Country Dance Ball. In this dance Competition is Very Thrilling and Interesting. And The thrill of the night for me was dancing Mairi's  Wedding, one of my favorite Scottish dances. My joy and amazement at being there to enjoy it gave the evening an extra glow.     Dance makes you feel like you can do anything. Dance is the one types of Feeling. The best feeling is when you feel so weightless while dancing that you think you could conquer the world. Dancing is a whole-body workout that's actually fun. It's good for your heart, it makes you stronger, and it can help with balance and coordination. ... With dance-inspired workouts ranging from ballroom and ballet to hip hop and club dance classes.        Dance is Important. Dance is more than the exploring of different ways to make a shape or learning a series of steps to music; it is a way of moving that uses the body as an instrument of expression and communication. ... Dance also enables students to better understand themselves and the world in which they live. But in my life Scottish dances is in my dream in our life.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631SV0MG
