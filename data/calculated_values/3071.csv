We meet weekly, year round, to work on music and dances and to socialize. Then, once a year, we put on a grand ball, with decorated hall, abundant refreshments, and elegant costumes. The band had been practicing hard for weeks. The dancers had been putting lots of effort into learning all the dances. I play guitar and four different sizes of recorder in the band. How I love playing live music for eager dancers! We give wings to their feet. Four of the six band members take turns dancing once or twice during the evening, year round, although, at the ball, we're lucky to get to dance once. This year, something very special was happening for the first time. I had introduced and taught a Scottish Country Dance, ""Mairi's Wedding"", to the group and helped find good sheet music for the three dance tunes for our arranger to set for recorders and violin. It's more challenging than most dances that the group has attempted, so the dancers gave their all to learning the complicated figures. Since I would be dancing, instead of playing, the band also had the challenge of learning three new music arrangements, without my help. The night before the ball, the unthinkable occured: I was in a serious automobile accident. I was miraculously unharmed, but both cars were towed; dear friends from the band rescued me and provided transportation the next day. After one last whirlwind of an afternoon workshop the day of the Ball, we were all as prepared as we could be.  We had gone through the most difficult of the dances one last time. Some guests from out of town were learning them for the first time, but did amazingly well. Then, everyone pitched in to help rearrange and decorate the hall, before dashing off to grab supper and change into ball costumes. When we returned to the hall, it was like stepping into another world and era. The hall looked magical. The setting seemed to inspire the dancers, who formed more perfectly aligned sets than ever before! Finally, the moment I'd been waiting for: it was time for Mairi's Wedding. In amazement and delight that I was still there to savor this experience, when our turn came for the lead, I looked at my partner and said, ""Let's fly!"" and we certainly did, sweeping through the figures joyously. The rest of the evening, I basked in the glow of contentment and satisfaction of that dance, as I played my best with the rest of the band, to give everyone their best Ball ever.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631SV0MG
