I would get off my phone, I would spend a set amount of hours a day just being off the internet. I felt disconnected from my family, I felt we were too reliant on our phones to socialize, and it wasn't healthy at all. I wanted a change in my life. So, me an my family took a day to just toss them to the side and see how it went. It was a massive success, I was able to connect with my daughter and talk about school and how she was doing--just get to know people, not the fakeness of what's presented through text. That isn't who a person is, they have their mannerisms and their ticks and their emotions that are hidden by sterile fonts and distance. You don't truly get to know someone until you look them in the eyes and talk to them, and we had a lot of fun doing this. I think I'm able to appreciate my family more now. We're able to talk without using our thumbs. We're able to be together without having to ignore people with our phones in our face. We're forced to interact, yes, but that's a force for positive change. It's also easy on the eyes, I'd think. You can live with a bright light into your eyes constantly, you know? It's just all around healthier.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO63Q8E0MK
