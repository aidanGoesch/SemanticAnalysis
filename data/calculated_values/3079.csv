We planned for months and final the day had come to depart from the USA and start the trip in Dublin. When we first landed in the morning we checked into the hostel in the city centre. After that we were able to grab lunch at a local spot recommended by an employee at the hostel. The places was absolutely delicious and decide to explore the city. We saw amazing architectures and had some amazing conversation with the locals. Couple days have past and now we are on our way to London by ferry and a absolutely long bus ride so we all decide to catch up on our sleep until we reach our destination. London was ok we got to see the most of the tourist attraction while trying traditional british food. Next stop was Amsterdam we had the opportunity to visit the Heineken brewery and a couple of museums while we made a brief stop here in this city. The city was beautiful and I really like the bike culture there. The absolute highlight of the trip was when we were in Switzerland. I have to say that this was the most memorable country during the whole trip. We went on a 5 hour hike to the longest pedestrian bridge. The journey to the bridge was hard but definity worth it. We got to see a couple of wild animals in the mountain and the most memorable moment was the jaw dropping views of the mountain with the clear blue skies. The food was kind of pricey but was worth every penny. The city and town we stayed in was super clean and the lake was crystal clear. I am glad that we got to meet a lot of different people from different cultures and taste food that we wouldn't have back in the states. I was a enjoyable trip to form new friendship and create amazing memories with friends that will last a lifetime.,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON95MO25,
