The Bahamas has an island for every taste and style, and it's easy to enjoy its subtropical charm during an overnight stint or a week-long cruise. The bahamas is known officially as the Commonwealth of the Bahamas,is a country within the Lucayan Archipelago in the West Indies. all and all it was a great memory for both of us! and going to the bahamas is a great place to get full of adventure, local culture, relaxation, romance and lot of events which helps to enjoy and love our vacation. The Bahamas is comprised of 700 islands and over 2,000 rocks and cays, sprinkled over 100,000 square miles of ocean. The archipelago is an ecological oasis, boasting the clearest water on the planet. we can see our toes as easily as you can the world’s third largest fringing barrier reef. the name “Bahamas” comes from the Spanish words “baja mar”, meaning shallow water or sea. there are many kinds of events like a  Junkanoo, McLean's Town Conch Cracking Festival. Bahamian culture combines influences from Africa and Europe and is related to Caribbean Creole culture as well as the Gullah culture of the southern U.S. Grand Bahama Island, Bahamas International Film Festival. going to all the events offered there is very exciting!",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDA1CDES
