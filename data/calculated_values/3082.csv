She believed in getting a promise ring before the engagement ring so I had to follow suit. I decided to get a very expensive promise ring from Kay Jewelers. The real challenge was deciding on a special place to do the proposal at. I remembered that she would always talk about a particular place that her now deceased mother used to love. It was a lighthouse on lake Hefner. I decided to have her come out and meet me at the lighthouse on the day that I would present her with the ring. It was cold out and the sun was already down. I was waiting at the lighthouse for her father to drive her out to the location. I was amazed by how beautiful it was out there at and around the lighthouse. One thing I was worried about was how much she would actually like the ring. I was almost sure of myself when I thought about how she wouldn't like it. However when I finally presented it to her, she loved it. I put the ring inside a collection of roses I had set out for her with a note in it confessing my love and passion for her. After this, we went out to eat at a very expensive restaurant, and we enjoyed the rest of our evening. Best of all, she ended up loving the ring to my surprise.",3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON9KCO2P,
