I tried the food there when i was there and i was blown away. The barbeque there was top notch and all the meat was so tender. We also tried a sushi place nearby that was highly rated as well. I got some ramen as well as chicken karage while my friends got sushi. At night, we went to many different bars. There was a street full of bars with different themes. We went to one that had the theme of shipping containers. It was packed and we all had a great time. I've never been to Austin so going there for the first time really made me appreciate it. There were many food trucks and we tried many of them. I got to eat at a food truck that sold Peruvian food. My time in Austin will always be remembered. I hope to visit it again sometime in the future. I want to be able to discover other things there.",,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON9VZO2Y
