The meat was really tender and juicy. It was like nothing that i've ever ate before. After that, we went to the capital to look around and saw many interesting things. It was a really tall building and there were many pictures in there.  We had to go through security before we were able to step in. At night, me and my buddies went out to some local bars. There was a bar there that was made entirely of containers! Oddly enough it was called Container Bar. There were many other bars nearby as well. The next day, we decided we wanted to go to the shooting range. It was my first time there so i was definitely a bit nervous. I was so nervous that i was shaking while holding the hand gun. In the end, it was a great time. I experienced many firsts. I would definitely be going back to Austin.",3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON9VZO2Y,
