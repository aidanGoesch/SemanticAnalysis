It was a great experience and i really enjoyed it. It was very memorable because it was my first time there. The people there were friendly and calm. I talked to this lady and we had a great conversation even though we never met before. All the Uber drivers that drove me around were nice as well. The food there was top notch. I had Texan barbeque and it was the best meat i've ever tasted. Everyone recommended the brisket which was what i got. The meat was very tender and fell right off the bone. After eating, i spend a lot of time just sight seeing. We went to the capital and it was beautiful inside. I even got to ride a Lime scooter. It was a bit scary though because i was riding without a helmet. I also didn't know the scooter rules so i just rode on the street with the cars which made it even scarier.",3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON9VZO2Y,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON9VZO2Y
