I worked in neuropsychological assessment, so I had patients that were rude, abrasive, and abusive, with no support from management.  I was in a room with no windows and bright florescent lights six to eight hours a day.  I did this for five years.  In March, I had the opportunity to go on a month-long trip to Thailand and Japan.  During that month, I clearly noticed the difference in my mood and behaviors.  I was more resilient, more optimistic, and I felt supported by my travel companions.  I also had a lot of new experiences, and adventure is important to me.  I came back with a renewed sense of self and a mindset that I knew would help me cope with the stresses at work.  Unfortunately, it took only four days before I was in my small, windowless dungeon shaking and crying.  That day, something in my mind broke.  It was the most clarity I've felt about my life since being diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008.  I knew I could no longer do that job.   That continuing to do that job would affect my health adversely.  I wrote my resignation letter the next day.  After that, I've read a lot of articles on recovering from burnout and self-care.  It's been a challenging yet satisfying road since I left.  I'm losing weight, I'm recovering my sense of self and learning more about my boundaries.  All in all, it was the right decision.  I wish I had done it two years earlier.",,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGONJT52OO
