I remember how scared I was the day that I went to the airport. My parents were crying, and even though I wanted to be strong, I bawled like a little baby. I felt sad to be leaving home, and scared about diving into the unknown. I didn't know anyone I would be living with. I didn't know the language, the customs, or the culture. I was confident in my ability to adapt, but how could I not be scared? I remember crying some more as the plane took off into the night. When I finally arrived, the next few days were some of the hardest I've ever had in my life. I felt alone, unsure of myself, and overwhelmed by the transition. My new room was big but felt empty. But after about a week or so, I met one of my roommates who had just moved in. We immediately hit it off and became friends. As I met more and more people, I began to feel less lonely and more and more at home. By the time I had to go home, I cried - but this time about leaving.",3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFOM3YTC,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFOM3YTC
