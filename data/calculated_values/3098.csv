He brought up an old friend of his who had sexually harassed me multiple times throughout my childhood and part of my early adulthood. This friend never did anything that was illegal enough for him to go to jail, but he constantly made me uncomfortable. It was always in secret when no one else was around, so my father never really knew about it. Eventually, once I was an adult, I had the courage to complain about the friend. My father didn't really believe me and thought I was exaggerating. Then, the friend finally did it in front of him. After that, they had a falling out for several years. Since I moved away from my home state, they seem to have reconciled. My father knows how uncomfortable this makes me, but he continues to be friends with the man. After hearing about him one too many times, I finally told my father to never mention him again, and he hasn't until our recent argument. During the argument, I told him that if he really feels like being friends with the man is so important even though he knows it hurts me, we wouldn't be able to speak with each other anymore. He told me I was overreacting and that because it happened so long ago, that it shouldn't matter. He claimed that my reaction was because of my mental health and that I had ""gone off the deep end"". This was particularly offensive because I deal with anxiety and depression and I had, over the past several months, come to confide in my father regarding these issues. I couldn't believe the way he was behaving. He refused to admit that he was wrong to treat me this way and would not even try to see things from my point of view. He is usually a pretty understanding person, so it really bothered me that he would treat me this way. This is one of the most hurtful things he has ever done to me in my entire life, and that's saying something because we have had our fair share of arguments over the years.",3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE
