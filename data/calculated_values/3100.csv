My daughter's pet died 1 week ago I know that for some people a pet will be something very silly but for us the I was a member of the family, I remember that my daughter went to school with her sister as usual and when she left school. I was very worried since I saw tuzzi very badly and told me that if I could take her to veterinarian when I left work I said of course that yes but unfortunately tuzzi died minutes later she called me crying and I went immediately to my house. She and everyone was crying, I also cried as part of our family for more than 10 years and it was very painful. After that we took my daughters my wife and I to have an ice cream all 4 together. The day after we put tuzzi in a shoe box and buried him in the courtyard of my house along with a cross that my daughter did extempore. Maybe this story sounds absurd to many. Maybe there are sadder stories but the loss of tuzzi to our family was very tragic. in those 10 years we spent many things together, I gave that pet to my daughter when she was only 5 years old. He was about to turn 11 with us, a few days have passed and my daughter is already better, my youngest daughter also suffered the loss but not as much as the older one since she has a slightly nobler heart and the lost they do it very badly. I told her that I could burn another pet when she decided to do it but she said no, that it was fine since she does not want to know about pets at the moment, she says that as a tuzzi there are not two. I lost a dog when I was a teenager, he accompanied me throughout my childhood and it was very important for me as a human being to grow up with him, now as an adult I have had more animals but nobody like my dog ​​who died. I firmly believe that an animal like this is only found once in your life. I hope that my daughter, as time goes by, feels better and better. For now she is having a good time and I hope that this will continue.",,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTPYTK
