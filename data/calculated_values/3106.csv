It was a very emotional time for me, but no so much for my kid! I did cry, of course. My baby is growning into an adult. I'm sure it is hard for any parent. It is a time of letting your child go out into the world. I will try to stay positive. I have reached out to other parents for support. I think a support system is very important. I told my son to keep in touch with me as much as possible, and I worry that he won't contact me as much as I want! I realize that he is an adult now so it is just something that I have to accept. I will never forget the long hug we shared as I was leaving. That will always be a precious memory in my mind. Thinking of it helps me remember our strong relationship. I know that I do not have to worry. My son will be fine!",,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DBU0SEV
