It was a very sad day. we helped him arrange his apartment. we took him to the store to get stocked up on groceries. we came back and visited for a while. that afternoon we decided it was time for us to head back home. i did not want to go. he is my boy and i am going to miss him dearly. this is good for him though. good for me, too. i am so very proud of him. he is going to be fine. i don't know if i will be, though. he is my first born. it is going to take me a while to recover, especially when i go into his room. it will be good to hear his voice when he calls. i don't know if i will be able to wait to hear from him. i will probably call him tonight!",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DBU0SEV,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DBU0SEV
