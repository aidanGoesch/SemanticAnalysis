Combining work with family has been as tough as life gets; my wife complaining of not spending much time with her and my little son. The complaint has been getting worse of late; I wouldn't blame her though, because it is actually true. The work has been stressful and time consuming even as a part-time job; I come back stressed most days and just get to sleep. I don't have much choice anyway; things have been tough for me especially after I got relieved from my last place of work. My former workplace was not as stressful as this present one is, but the job was much more boring. It was one of the reasons why I was a bit happy when I got this present one. The job entails been away from home, most times even away from my state of residence due to the nature of jobs we do get. Recently, I got another part-time job with similar working conditions so as to augment my monthly salary as much as I can. This is the sole reason why getting to spend time with my family has been difficult, wife was really angry when I told her I got another part-time job. She is not working currently, and there are bills to be paid. I grew up in a hard-working family, and been a workaholic was a way of life back then; figured that's why I hardly depend on anyone for financial assistance. I like being able to provide for my family in any legal means possible. I have been trying to explain and make her see reasons with me; although it has been difficult. Recently,the complains have dropped down a bit, and she's starting to see reasons with me.",,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN1ES7
