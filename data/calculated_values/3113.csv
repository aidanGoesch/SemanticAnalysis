I have three children, and unfortunately their father is not consistent with his child support payments.  Under the circumstances, I either had to pull the kids out of their extra-curricular activities, or earn more money. I work at Starbucks part time, in addition to my regular job.  Because I do have a day job, my Starbucks shifts are usually at night. I am gone from before the children get home from school until 10:30 or so at night. Lately I have been working 3 or 4 nights each week, which means I have very little time in the evenings with the kids.  Schoolwork is starting to suffer, and I am exhausted. I don't really get enough sleep when I work a night shift, since I still have to get up at the usual time to get the kids off to school, and me to work. I keep hoping that I can cut back to no more than two nights during the week, and one Saturday morning, but I have to be available when the store needs me. I also try to stay involved in the children's activities, and volunteer when I can.  It seems like there is never enough time. I don't glorify busyness, either.  I really do try to find ways to cut back, but with three children, two jobs, and no help, it is super hard.  I know it is just a season in my life, and I try to stay focused on being lucky enough to be able to manage two jobs, but I am tired. So very tired.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN1ES7,
