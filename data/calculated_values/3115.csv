A little over three months ago, my husband was injured on the job site. This has been challenging for us both from a financial standpoint, as he is on workers comp instead of receiving his full pay for working, including his usual overtime hours, and from an emotional standpoint. It is difficult for him to sit idly at home most of the day rather than being productive in his physically demanding job. He is becoming very restless but is limited in his ability to even complete projects around the house during this time off from work due to the nature of the injury. He does attend physical therapy three times a week which gives him an outlet outside the house but progress is slow and on days after physical therapy, he's more exhausted and the pain flares a bit more so he's resigned to the couch for most of the day afterwards and can't even do many minor chores around the house. They told us it should be getting easier by now, but it's just not and that's hard to deal with. I don't know how many more months of this we can take. It's hard for me to shoulder the burden of the majority of the household tasks as he is physically unable right now. The other challenge is financial. We had become accustomed to the extra income from his overtime hours, and while I'm thankful for worker's compensation to help cover most of the missing income, it doesn't help with the income above and beyond his base rate. We had been making progress in building up our emergency savings and having some extra disposable income. Now without the overtime hours, the savings progress has come to a screeching halt. It's frustrating to say the least. I have no ability work overtime hours at my job so we're fairly stuck income wise for the time being. I really hope his injury starts healing faster and that he's able to go back to work in some capacity very soon because this is draining and stressful for everyone in our household right now.",,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DNHLSE2
