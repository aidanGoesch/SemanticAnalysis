To say that it was painful for me was an understatement.  It was sad to see her wither away and suffer, knowing that there was going to be no happy ending.  She tried, but she could no longer do the things that she enjoyed and was restricted by her disease.  I felt devastated when I found out that she was stopping treatment and entering hospice.  That decision is so final that it is heartbreaking.  I felt so sad for her children and grandchildren, who I know she loved the most in the world.  She passed away on a Monday and was gone.  At the time of her death, it was hard to even recognize her.  She didn't look like the smiling, loving woman I see in my mind.  Cancer took everything from her and that's why I hate it.  At times, my grief is overwhelming, and at other times, I remember the memories and all the good times that we have shared.  My sister-in-law taught me that nothing is more important than family.  That is how she lived her life always.  My kids loved her because she loved them and always let them know that they were important.",,3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF91R8F2H
