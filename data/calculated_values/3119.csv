I think back to the look we shared as he was walking down the lane to find his seat. He was a vision compared to his other classmates. He looked at me and winked with a glimmer in his eyes, a look that said it all. The long hours of studying all these years have finally paid off and he is finally graduating. The road up until here was not an easy one but we made it. The graduation ceremony took place in the arena in the city and was as grand as you could imagine. The arena was prepared for a prestigeous ceremony with attendees from prestigeous educational backgrounds. It really was a day to remember. The commencement speeches started and we were impatiently waiting for them to hand out the certificates to the graduates. My phones camera was on full blast along with our digital camera and video camera. My husband and kids and family was all there and cheering when they called his name and as he walked up to the stage to receive his degree we all went wild with cheers and hollers. He looked up at us in the stand and smiled and waved as we screamed our excitement. he took his degree and proudly walked back to his seat. This is what we had all been waiting for all these years. The celebration of achievement is a celebration like no other. I hope that every parent gets to feel this feeling of pride and love of their childs achievements.",,3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5
