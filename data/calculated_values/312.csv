The most memorable part of this event was being presented with a special token by my sponsor, who had told me that they were unable to attend, yet surprised me by showing up. This was memorable and surprising because a sponsor is someone who plays a very important role in your recovery. They are someone who you trust and who is there for you 24/7 throughout your recovery process and they take on many roles in your life. They are not only your sponsor, but a friend, a confidant, a mentor, someone who helps to guide you, and so much more. Sharing in the milestones, accomplishments, and even the slip ups and downfalls is something that they are there for, so thinking that my sponsor was not going to make it to one of the biggest milestones of my recovery, was a very sad and disappointing moment for me to say the least. One of my close friends in the meetings took the place of my sponsor initially and stood up in front of the room. They apologized that my sponsor was unable to make it and said that they were grateful to be speaking in their place. Then there was some silence and some clapping and hollaring. I stopped and looked around and all of a sudden I saw and heard my sponsor! When they stood up in front of the room and announced their presence, I was extremely surprised and overjoyed! This was something that would have been more than enough, but to have them give a speech and to hear the things that they had to say about me, for me, and to me, truly made it one of the most memorable moments in my life. My sponsor stood in front of the entire room and spoke about my journey in recovery, as well as how we met and how I approached them to be my sponsor. They described me in a way that I could not imagine myself, but made me realize that it was in fact me. They explained how proud they were of me, how far I have come, and expressed their wishes for me for the future. My sponsor told me that they were hesitant at first to take on a new sponsee, but that they were glad that they did because not knowing me and not being a part of my journey would've been a very disappointing thing. They described me as a good friend, a good person, a beautiful person, and someone who is capable of change and acceptance. They wished the best for me in all that I do and in my continued road in recovery. Hearing all of the nice things that they had to say made me cry. It truly was a beautiful, surprising, and memorable experience and event.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDCIGDEW,
