I can precisely picture everything about my surroundings that night. I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture. This night, however, I can clearly recall the view across the room, the colors, the sounds, the whole entirety of it all, and most importantly, the feelings. I know I could go back to that huge room and find the seat I was sitting in among thousands just based on the clarity of my memory. I took everything in. Before the graduation, I had trouble finding parking and rushed into the venue at the last moment, worried I wouldn't be able to find a seat. I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available. At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not. He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was. Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away. In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant. The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt. In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night. As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through. Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me. With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes. I will never forget the look he had on his face. It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility. Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared. Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words.",3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5,
