He was graduating from college and it was a very special trip for me. The ceremony was held in a huge auditorium in the middle of downtown. I arrived a few minutes late because parking was a nightmare. When I got inside, I struggled to find a seat where I could see him. He texted me to let me know where he was on the stadium floor and I got as close as I could. The whole time, he looked like an ant to me and I really couldn't see him. The ceremony was enjoyable and I gushed with pride the whole time as well as a few tears. After the ceremony, I texted him to let him know where I was sitting. Luckily, I was located above the exit that the graduates were filing out of.  At the very end of the night, the most wonderful thing happened. The most memorable part of the evening was when the graduates were walking out and he looked up and made eye contact with me. We locked eyes and I have never seen him so proud and happy. It was our own special moment. That look is something I will never forget. Every time I think of that night and the pride and happiness for him that I have, the look in his eyes at that moment is the first thing that pops into my head.",3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5,3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5
