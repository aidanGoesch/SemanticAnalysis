It was a very calm and peaceful morning filled with a lot of excitement and pride. I walked into the meeting feeling a little nervous, but once the leader of the meeting began to speak, my nerves settled and I felt more comfortable and accomplished. The leader made a brief statement about how far I had come in my recovery / journey, how proud she was of me, and how I had touched and affected her life. Once she finished making her speech, she introduced me, as well as presented me with my two year token and a very beautiful cake. Afterwards, my sponsor surprised me by making an appearance. Initially, she had told me that she would be unable to attend, which made me very disappointed because she was and is such an important part of my sobriety and recovery. My sponsor came to the front of the room and made a speech about me and my recovery, which made me cry because it was very emotional. After this, everyone in the room had cake and many of them came up to me individually to congratulate me and praise my success in recovery. Many of the participants of the meeting brought me little gifts and keepsakes, which made me feel very special. One of the gifts I received was a little box that had my sobriety / clean date engraved on it, as well as a very special quote that I find inspiration in. ""For where your treasure is there your heart will be also"". My sponsor gave me a journal that had an inscription inside the front cover from her along with my sobriety / clean date. This was a very memorable event because I have worked very hard to overcome a great deal of vices in my life, including addiction and the underlying conditions and issues that have had an impact on my addiction. To be able to stand up in front of a room filled with my peers and honestly say that I have been clean and sober for two years was such a memorable and special experience and event.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDCIGDEW,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDCIGDEW
