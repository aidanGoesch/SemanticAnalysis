As I reflect on it, it certainly made my depression worse but I believe its partly due to the sudden realization that everything I love can potentially be gone tomorrow in the blink of an eye. It's a frightening and sobering thought. I loved my grandfather deeply, and I had tremendous guilt over not being able to say goodbye to him or tell him I love him one last time. It was absolutely devastating. Now closing in on the one year anniversary of his passing, its hitting me all over again. Dia de los Muertos is coming up, which is a holiday celebrated in my culture, and I created an ofrenda -- or an offering altar -- for my grandfather in remembrance. I hope that he knows I loved him deeply and I'm sorry and I intend to do better, be more present, with my loved ones. That being said, I think holding onto this overwhelming amount of sadness and guilt is not helping me grieve. I understand that there is no timeline on how you're supposed to heal from these types of losses but I don't know if how I am currently coping is beneficial or not. Ultimately, I just want to hold my grandfather in my memory, fondly, and not hurt as much as I do. I suppose thats easier said than done. Only time will tell, but with everything going on, I just need a little respite. It's such a traumatic thing, to lose someone so suddenly like that. The only positive thing right now I can muster is maybe I learned something from this.",3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5DS2UP4,
