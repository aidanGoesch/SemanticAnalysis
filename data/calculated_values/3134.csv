He is 23 years old and had a wonderful job offer he had decided to take. I don't care how old he is, he is my youngest, my baby, and it hurts that he left. I am scared and nervous that he will need me but I will not be there to help him and guide him on the right decisions in his life. I am going to miss him so much. We would talk about everything and I feel like this separation will pull us apart. I know in my head that he is a grown man and has to make decisions that are right for him but my heart wants to hold him close. I tried to be happy for him and to put on a strong face. When he left he cried, hugged me close and said he would miss me. That broke my heart. I cried so hard I felt like I was dying inside. Of course his father told me I was being ridiculous, I don't care what he says, I feel like a part of me is gone. My older son Tim, he is staying here and I have to hold on to that. I love him just as much as Kenny but we were never as close. He does not confide in me and ask me for guidance. I don't feel like he needs me as much anymore. I hated living in Florida. It was always hot and the people there are selfish and mean. West Virginia feels like home. I love it here. But to be here means losing out on being with my son. I feel so torn but I have to do what is right for me. He has to grow and become a man on his own. I understand but I don't want to let go. I hope I can stay strong for them both.",,3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5MN2PUY
