I feel the sense of completeness today. My ben called me mama for the first time. It was so surprising and a pleasant shock to say the least. I felt like a mom for the first time in my life today. It happened unexpectedly as i kissed him tonight. He was drifting to sleep as usual. i do not know what powered that within him. But i couldn't be happier. John was thrilled by it as well. he was at his tour during that time. He immediately cancelled all his appointments and is on his way back right now. Afterall, what can be more important than Ben? The entire family is thrilled and happy. We are even considering to throw a party on this occasion.",,3I2PTA7R3UG5JR78O43MZH5HE72KQI
