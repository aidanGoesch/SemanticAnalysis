I remember how badly we wanted to open this business for years but never had the money. One day we met up with a friend who had they money to make it happen. We became business partners and were finally able to open our store. We were beyond excited to the point where we wanted to cry. Our business partner put in the funds and we supplied the product. We had so much inventory at our home that was enough to start this business. Opening day went extremely well. We had customers from all over town. We even had customers show up from other towns! We made a killing that day. We specialize in product for hobbyists. Our store give a place for kids to come in and enjoy video games as well as card games. I love waking up every day to go into work with my husband and continue to thrive with what we have accomplished. This store supports our family and everything we want. Sometimes keeping up with the store is a struggle, but we manage to give it our all and the store runs smoothly for the most part. We run card tournaments which attracts people from all over. Til this day we continue to give everything we have into this business. I am so happy to be able to give the people of this community a place where they can feel safe and comfortable somewhere to game freely without being judged by others.",,3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4I4C72A5
