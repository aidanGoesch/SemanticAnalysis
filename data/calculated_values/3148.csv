We hit it off pretty well and decided to keep in touch after that day. We talked on the phone on a few, exchanged a few texts. Nothing serious or crossing the line. This was a very platonic friendship that never gave off the vibes of it being anything else. One night during some bar hopping, I had bumped into my friends who so happen to be really good friends with this guy. He had been with them that night, but left to explore the nearby bars. One of his buddies called him to let him know that they had seen me there and if I wanted to come out and say hi. We all hung out for a bit and later one by one people started going their own ways. I stayed being to hang out with him. We talked, had a few drinks. The conversations went from seriousness to playful and back to seriousness. He knew I had a boyfriend and I was aware that he wanted to be intimate with me. Leaning in as we sat there drinking, he kissed me. I didn't stop him, but I also didn't react by moving my lips. Just allowed him to place his over mine and kiss me. Hit me in that moment how unhappy I was with my current boyfriend. It was the kiss that grew some spell on me. The kiss only solidified a truth that I had buried deep down because I was afraid of moving on from my relationship.",3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IL1R2AK,
