First thing out of my mouth was, "" Just know that I have a boyfriend."" He kindly acknowledge my status and we both moved on. One night I saw him at a bar with a few of our other friends. We chatted it up and moved over to a more empty table that had room for me to sit on. He was cocky about his intentions with me. Brushing off the fact that I had a boyfriend and attempted to seduce me. It's strange when things like this occur because you sort of take a backseat inside your mind as you watch the events unfold. Leaning in as he kissed my lips. I sat there frozen. Not because he had just crossed a line, but how much I enjoyed his soft dominating lips against mine. I simply looked down and once again reminded him that I had a boyfriend. Implying that a simple kiss meant nothing and it was just something that only we would know. Our little shared secret. We ordered a few more drinks as we laughed the night away. No matter how much drinking or how many days pass by. The truth is is that I enjoyed his kiss and there is no secret that I may not even be as in love with my boyfriend as I thought I had once been.",3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IL1R2AK,3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IL1R2AK
