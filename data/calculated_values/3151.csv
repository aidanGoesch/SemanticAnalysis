I needed surgery but would not be able to have it due to my weight.  The doctor was rather blunt and borderline rude.  However, I could kind of see his point of view as well.  Because of this, I made a commitment to lose weight.   I was hoping that the memory of him being rude coupled with the chronic pain I am in daily would help.  It actually did somewhat.  For a few short weeks, I did everything I could to accomplish this goal.  I drank only water, no sodas at all.  I completely cut out sugars.  The doctor stressed that sugar addiction is stronger than heroin addiction.  I made a small amount of progress.  Then, much to my surprise, I had a diet soda.  That diet soda soon replaced most of the water I had been drinking.  It seemed like I had completely relapsed.  My desire for sugar returned with a vengeance.  I now have to start over from scratch again.  I guess the doctor was right about sugars after all.",3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IN952AG,
