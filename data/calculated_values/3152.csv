I was informed that I would be unable to have needed surgery unless I lost some weight.  I was expecting it in a way, but it really upset me to hear it said so harshly.  He was very firm and knowledgeable. At the same time, he was cold and seemed uncaring but I took what he said to heart. As I was crying in his office,  I was told to stop drinking any soda at all and to completely cut out sugar.  I was also told that sugar is more addictive than heroin and almost impossible to stop consuming it.  I made the decision to  not let this addiction win and I have embraced my new lifestyle of no sugar.  I am determined to lose the weight in order to improve my health.  Without this Doctor being so firm and, yes, harsh, I would not have considered that I can actually do this task. I was understandably very upset.  I am morbidly obese. This is a big task for me. I believe that with proper support, I can accomplish this.  I need the support of my family.  I also need to keep in mind that this is definitely a life saving event.",3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IN952AG,3I33IC7ZWGOIFVW1A20W9L4IN952AG
