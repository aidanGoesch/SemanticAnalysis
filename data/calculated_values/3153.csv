The horse was pretty young herself, but I am a breeder, and she was at a safe age to have a baby. It was a miracle. I know most people probably wouldn't care about a horse, but I feel I was lucky enough to experience the miracle of life. It was a true miracle. Seeing my horse just lie there and bring another life into the world, was magical to say the least. I made sure to be by my horse's side. I made sure that I was available to her and made sure that I would give her anything she might need in order to feel more comfortable. Even though I wished that my father was there, since he was the one who suggested we breed her, I was still so incredibly happy about this. I was so happy to learn that my baby now had a baby. And the baby was beautiful. It was also a female, and she looked just like her mother when her mother was born. I will always remember my beautiful horse. I will always remember that day. There are some things you just can't forget.",,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ1DDO5A
