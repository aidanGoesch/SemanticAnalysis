Getting my horse pregnant was a very tricky operation. She had a curved cervix so it took many tries before she finally tested positive. I moved her to a facility that solely dealt with equine reproduction. One day I was lucky enough to arrive at the facility just as she was giving birth. I was told by the people who run the place beforehand that most likely I wouldn't be able to be present because more often than not, horses give birth in the middle of the night. So it was some very good fortune that we arrived in time to experience it. When we got to the facility, I didn't see my horse. The thought even crossed my mind that she was stolen. But then I saw she was on the ground, in labor. The whole process was amazing. I had mixed feelings of excitement and concern for my horse. Horses can have breech births. This can sometimes can result in both the mother and foal dying. But I didn't need to be concerned. The birth was amazingly fast. My horse got on her feet immediately. She was very attentive to her foal. The best part for me was seeing the filly get to her feet. It was a bit of a struggle at first and she was very wobbly. Then she started nursing and everything seemed to be as it should.",3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ1DDO5A,
