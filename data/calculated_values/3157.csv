My first day was March 11th, and though it doesn't really have anything to do with the story, I will always remember the date because that's my ex's birthday. Getting this job means a lot to me because it's my first career job and it's in my field of study - communications. I was scared at first because I was unsure of the workplace culture and I felt weary that I wouldn't fit in. On my first day, I got to know my boss a little bit more since out small conversations during the interview process, and she made me feel comfortable at work and showed me around the workplace. I met some of my coworkers, who are now good friends of mine, and I just remember being uncertain and anxious about whether or not my boss would decide to keep me on the job. It'd been about 9 months since I'd graduated from college, and I'd been rejected by jobs I'd been applying for left and right. It was soul sucking and I felt stuckl; I thought that I would never find a job. Even after getting hired for this one, I was still in disbelief that it even happened and I was preparing myself internally for the worst or for something to somehow go wrong. On my first day, I was over dressed. I saw this as mostly a good thing, as I wanted to make a good first impression on my boss and my coworkers. Though, it was scorching hot outside, and I wished I could have worn shorts. For lunch I had Five Guys delivered to me and it was ridiculously delicious. All throughout the day, my boss was telling me everything I needed to know about my job, my duties, processes that go on at work, who to talk to about what, and all sorts of other useful information. It was definitely a case of information overload, but I was very eager and fully capable of handling anything she threw at me (like ideas, I mean). Though it was my first day, nothing spectacular really happened. Truthfully, I was just trying to get acclimated to my new environment, while also being terrified that I would lose this new job somehow. I think my first day was a lesson in preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best. I am always fully prepared for the good things in my life to be taken away from me, but that doesn't mean that I don't hope that more good things will come into my life. I love my life, and I love my job, and my first day taught me to not worry so much sometimes and to just accept the good that happens to me.",,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ1MKO5Z
