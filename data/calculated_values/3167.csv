I had a lot in mind and I did not even know what I was going to do about my birthday. I did my exercises like I always do,took a shower and then dressed up for work. I kissed my girlfriend and left with my car. I arrived at work and everyone was wishing me a happy birthday but I wondered why my girlfriend did not wish me a happy birthday because she never missed telling me happy birthday before.  I began my usual duties and in the evening went back home because I was very tired. To my surprise,most of my friends and family members were waiting for me to arrive because they had organized a party for me. That is how I understood why she never wished me a happy birthday. I was so happy because my closest friends were all in the house ready to make my birthday memorable. The party began and everyone was happy since they all loved alcohol. Music was loud and the neighbors never complained and we all spent every minute having a good time. After a while something unexpected happened to me. I decided to go to the bathroom and when I went upstairs,I found my girlfriend kissing my friend and this made me speechless. I did not know what to say but it hut me deeply and all I could think of is to walk out of he house very angry. People just stood there watching my girlfriend following me but I just ignored and left. I took my car and left and some of my friends followed me because they did not want me to do something bad. I stopped when I realized they were following me and that s when I told them what had happened. They felt betrayed as well because the guy was one of their close friends and so we decide to go to a night club and spend the rest of the night there to avoid drama.",3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZTFEO57,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZTFEO57
