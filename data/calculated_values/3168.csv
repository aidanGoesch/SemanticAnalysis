He had to move out because of this and we only get to talk over the phone. I am sad about this. I pass the time watching Netflix. Netflix can only keep me distracted for so long. I also play games. This still doesn't fill enough time. I might have to go see a doctor about my depression. I hope it gets better. I should be able to cope with it after a month. He said he'll visit every few months. I hope I can make it in time. This has been a very boring month. I hope something good shows up on Netflix soon. I'll get a pizza to cope with the depression.,,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZU9J5OI
