Not that our relationship had any problem. He just found a job out of the town and I didn't want to leave my job at this moment. We never stayed apart ever since we started to stay together after overcoming a lot of difficulties and surviving a intercontinental long distance relationship. So it was a hard decision for us to stay apart, although we knew it is nothing like the end and we will still see each other once in every one week - or almost every week. We went for shopping to buy the essential stuffs for his new home. We also purchased a new car and bought groceries so that he can feed himself for a while. I thought it would be all fine, I am an independent person and was staying by myself for a long while. But It felt weirdly sad. I told myself it is a good thing and there is no reason to be sad. Still I couldn't help myself feeling somewhat down. Now I feel I am recovering. I don't feel as bad as before. I am taking a good care of myself, I believe. And I know he tries to spend as much time with me as he can. Hope we will make it through.",,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZU9J5OI
