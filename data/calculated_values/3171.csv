Into a good school that is. When I went to get game into the school I found out that we were 10 feet from the district line for the school. I wanted home to be in this zone and this was super upsetting obviously. He was going to have to go to a school district that was not safe at all and one that me and my wife did not want him to have to go to. We really needed him to get into the school in to the right one.  So we decided that the only course of action would be for us to move. That of course is a lot easier said than done. We needed to move so we would not have to pay tuition so we started looking for a new place to live. This led us to realize that the housing market is crap her so we went weeks and weeks to try to find a decent place to live no  luck. this was unfortunate. this is not what we needed or even wanted this was a really large let down on all fronts. I called the school board and they said the rules were that he would have to pay tuition I tried to apply for a waiver since we were so close to the right zone but no luck. So, in the end, we paid the tuition. We still have not found a place to rent. This is one of the most frustrating experiences off my life.",,3I7DHKZYGOM5AJWW31OMLTIL4Z9F57
