I don't know why I'm only writing about this now, I guess I just needed time to process. About 2 months ago I was driving home from work. I stayed late to help out with some extra work that needed to be done. That jerk Gary called in again and screwed us all over. Anyway by the time I left it was getting dark already and had started to rain. I headed out and was driving carefully because I knew I needed new tires. Once I got out on the highway I was getting maybe a little overconfident and impatient and started speeding up. It didn't help that someone was right on my butt like always! Anyway I kept moving down the highway and was getting into a groove with the flow of traffic around me and started moving faster and faster. Before I knew it I had lost control and the steering wheel wasn't responding! I know now what was happening, I was hydroplaning, but at the time I guess I was panicking and freaked out. I was jamming pedals and jerking the wheel and once the tires got some grip I guess I had the wheel turned the wrong way because my car immediately spun out. I went in circles for what felt like a mile and a half and slid down a hill. For a moment I thought this was the end! But it.....wasn't. By the time I reached the bottom of the hill the car had slowed and I bounced harmlessly off a service van. My car had a dent and the van was scratched, but that's all. Whew. I was shaken up and have thought about what I did wrong over and over again since.",,3I7DHKZYGOM5AJWW31OMLTILAFDF5D
