I had some errands that I had to take care of.  While I was leaving the bank, it started to rain even harder.  When I was coming down the street, the light in front of me turned read.  When I tried to stop, my car started to slide.  I had hit a big puddle on the side of the road.  When I hit the water, my car started to hydroplane.  I was so scared.  I spun completely around two full times.  When I reached the bottom of the hill, my car hit a service van.  Luckily, I was not hurt.  I was wearing my seat belt. The driver of the service van thankfully was not hurt either.  When I got out of the car, I was nervous to look and see what my car looked like.  It felt like my car had a lot of damage.  I was shocked to see it was only somewhat dented.  It was at least still about to drive.  I had hit the bumper of the service van.  Therefore, that vehicle did not have much damage at all.  There were mainly just some scratches on the bumper.  The main thing was that neither of us drivers were hurt, besides being a little shook up.",,3I7DHKZYGOM5AJWW31OMLTILAFDF5D
