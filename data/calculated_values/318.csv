About two months ago, I had a hard day at work, my boss gave me a second warning about being late and warned me that next time I would be fired. On my way home from work that day, I stopped off at the liquor store and bought a jug of vodka. When I got to my car, I immediately started drinking, I felt so hopeless and like I had nothing to live for. I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills.  I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn’t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn’t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn’t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn’t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on. All of my personal belongings were taken into the units custody. Soon a psychologist came into give me an evaluation. After I was at this place for seven hours with staff members monitoring me, I was told I could leave if there was someone who would come and get me. I called my mom and she came and picked me up, was so scared she was going to be mad at me, but when she arrived she gave me a huge hug as tears were streaming down her cheeks, she told me she was going to help me with my drinking problem and she loved me.",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDMEDEDW
