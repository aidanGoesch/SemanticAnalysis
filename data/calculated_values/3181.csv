The wedding was in San Francisco, which I'd never been to before but was beautiful.  Well, most parts were beautiful; some parts had obvious homeless and drug problems.  But the wedding itself was gorgeous and everyone had a great time.  This was my cousin from my mother's side of the family.  I'd known her since I was a small boy and we'd always been really close.  She wanted me to be in the wedding in some capacity but I had work obligations that made that impossible so I could only be a guest.  But we were both content that I just made it; I can't fathom having missed it.  Anyway, the wedding was held inside in a church.  My cousin wore a gorgeous white wedding dress with a long train.  I thought it was really classy, while still being modern and sexy, which seems like a thing these days.  My nuclear family was with me and thought the same thing.  I was disappointed to not get to see that much of my cousin during the weekend, but I guess that's the nature of weddings and what happens when you're the bride.  You have a lot of stuff to do, a lot of people to see, and a lot to worry about.  The rest of the family had a fabulous time getting together again as a group.  We all stayed at a local motel, just to keep costs down, but it was perfect because we were all near each other.  Each night the whole extended family would pack into someone's room, order pizza, chat, watch TV, reminisce, and just have a great time bonding.  I wish my cousin could have joined in that--sometimes I think the bride and groom miss the best parts of their own weddings!  Everyone really liked the groom, which I thought was wonderful.  He's such a great guy and treats my cousin so well.  I'm so happy for her, and for him, since she's wonderful too.  At the end of the weekend we all said goodbye and tearfully went back to our own lives.  But it's always fun to get together for these types of events.  Seeing the whole family again, like we used to when we were young and had family reunions--it's just so much fun and so comfortable to be around those people.  But it was also great to see San Francisco, and, most importantly, celebrate the start of the new life of my wonderful and beloved cousin.",,3IAEQB9FMF62PIXK8WG5NTSDABIWDX
