The job was a step down for me at the time but the promotion would have been a large step up. Supposedly the job I actually wanted was going to be free in the next six months. The person who held that job was supposed to be retiring. Well six months turned into a year, and then another year. It was somewhat frustrating but I made the best of it. I got a raise and more responsibilities and began to take on more of the tasks that I would eventually inherit. I did start to get frustrated though as I had been promised one thing and given another. It seemed like the rumor of retirement was just that a rumor. Every six months I was told that he would be retiring soon. This went on for almost five years and I was taking on more and more of his tasks without the corresponding pay. It got to the point where I was actively seeking a new job. I made it known that I was not going to wait any longer and then it finally happened. After five years he finally announced his retirement. I was told to stick around for a bit longer and the job was finally mine. It took a lot longer than promised but in the end worked out ok. I got a large pay raise and promotion and have a place where I will be for a long time.",3IAEQB9FMF62PIXK8WG5NTSDH5HDW8,
