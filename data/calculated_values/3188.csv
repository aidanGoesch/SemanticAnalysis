It was a spur-of-the-moment thing. She needed to be on his insurance but she had just quit her job. But it was very legitimate, too. They had avoided getting married because they're both divorced. They had a beach theme. Everyone showed up in cutoffs or bathing suits and sandals or bare feet. I had never seen her so happy before. The way she looked at him when exchanging vows was precious. I was so proud of her. And I was proud to be there. Honestly, the best part though was that my daughter and son reconnected. She asked him to be a witness. It was a big thing to do. They hadn't talked in a year or so. He was very honored to accept. So that was the best part for me.",3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOO2JL2BN,3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOO2JL2BN
