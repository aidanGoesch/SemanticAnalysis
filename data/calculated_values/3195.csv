I headed down four brick stairs and allowed him to pee.  I made my way back up the stairs to the top ready to head back in the house.  Suddenly, my dog decided he wasn't finished using the restroom.  I turned around to go back down the stairs but my foot missed the next step and I feel sideways, landing on my left arm.  I was a bit stunned at first. I looked at my bloody palm as I lie there.  I began to slowly sit up.  Once I sat up, I broke into a sweat and felt nauseous.  I thought I was going to pass out.  I called for my husband who was inside eating breakfast. It took several calls before he found me.  I knew something wasn't right.  I had him take my dog back in the house while I tried to make my way back up the stairs from which I just fell.  I looked in the mirror and noticed by arm was bent and I could not straighten it.  I went to the urgent care and my fears were confirmed...I had broken my arm.  A nice Sunday at home turned into a day of dread and pain.",3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOOCUIB2P,3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOOCUIB2P
