We finally found the one that we wanted and I was excited to share with my boyfriend. Since we were moving in together we had to spend a considerable amount of time figuring out what furniture and other household items we should keep and what not to take with us. We also then had to consider how we were going to decorate the place. I was very excited about the move and I tried to keep a level head, but that was hard. So when the time came my boyfriend and I took time off work and spent a few days moving and getting the place decorated. It was a lot of hard work, but we were very happy with the results. Once we had settled in, we decided to through a little housewarming get together with close friend and family. We were so excited to show off the new apartment and all the hard work we put into it. Just about everyone we invited said they could make it. Unfortunately my aunt couldn't make it that day, but we still had a good time. A few days later my aunt showed up to see the place. I was excited and showed her around. I ended up even more excited when she presented me with a housewarming gift. It was a decorative piece of art that I really enjoyed and immediately put up on the wall.",,3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOOMQ9B2I
