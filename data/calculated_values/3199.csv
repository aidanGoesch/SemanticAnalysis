The materials had completely coated the pavement. Something came over me--I had a feeling of going into autopilot when I saw a man about my age beeline out of the truck to scramble for the debris that had fallen. I biked across the street with the intention of helping him lift the materials back onto his truck. He was overtly grateful to me, and asked that I come to his office later to get compensation for my act. I was hesitant, but he insisted. When I visited his office later, it turned out he was a CEO for a tech startup, and was working on building an app with investor capital. I let him know I was a computer science major, was interested in building an app, and was dissatisfied with my current office job at a call center for an online private education institution. I'd taken a break from school to work at that call center. The environment was very hostile, the office politics brutal, and the work expectations for the expected wages inequitable. In addition I don't have my driver's license yet so I had to bike or take a city bus to get to work--affording relying on Uber/Lyft was out of the question because I sent any part of my paycheck to my mother who was suffering from Crohn's disease and homeless in an extended-stay motel. So I was desperate to find a less hellish opportunity. He convinced me that I'd be a valuable asset to the project, and talked about equity for the app if it was successful. I had no experience with this kind of stuff, but I decided to go for it. I eventually transitioned from working my office job to working for him. I spent the next 4 months building the UI for his app along with 5 interns. I witnessed shocking things I never had seen before with regards to human greed and corporate backstabbing in the software development field. The app didn't get finished, and without warning I was laid off because all of the investors had pulled out. Right before Christmas 2018. I was devastated, and found out the CEO ended up dissolving his company, declared bankruptcy, got divorced, sold all his possessions, and ended up institutionalized. I went through a dark period myself, but with the help of my best friend and my mom (my only family), I gained online employment such that I can fully sustain myself (with a roommate), maintain a 401K, and have decided that I don't want to be a part of the 9-5 work environment if it's going to be so toxic. I have gone back to school to finish my degree, am working on gaining a CompTIA Security+ certificate, and am working on an app of my own--my situation now far more stable. I'm beyond grateful for all the lessons I learned!",,3IFS6Q0HJJ5QQCWXG57FH1556GJSI5
