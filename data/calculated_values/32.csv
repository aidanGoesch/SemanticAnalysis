I  I splashed water on my face and exited the bathroom, intending to go to my upstairs sitting room to see if the outside porch door was closed.  I had neglected to turn any lights, so the hallway was dark.  I took a path that I thought would lead to my sitting room, but,  I found myself falling through space.  I has accidentally gone toward the stairs and tumbled over.  I remember hitting the first flight on my right side, and heard a strange voice, describing, to me, exactly what was happening.    I knew I was hurt, badly, and I lay there for a few seconds, not yet in intense pain, but just trying to come to terms with what had just happened.  Luckily, my brother was staying with me and he came quickly and helped me get my self into a proper position.  The pain had set in and I was sure I had hurt myself pretty badly.

I later found out that is how to check to see if you have had a stroke.  I was  X-ray'd  and I received a MRI.  They found that I had a broken right collarbone and several broken ribs on both sides.  Also, I suffered a subdural hemotoma that caused bleeding on my brain.  They were obviously more worried about my brain injury.  I received a half dozen MRI's of my head.  As far as the broken bones, they just gave me a splint and told me that the collarbone and ribs would heal over time.  For the next ten days, my stay at the hospital consisted of doctors asking me to smile and to squeeze their fingers.  My slurred speech disappeared but I did notice a lingering numbness in my left hand, that has since disappeared and a numbness on the left side of my face, that has not.",308XBLVESJQ42PIEV6FT54WWPO4RBV,308XBLVESJQ42PIEV6FT54WWPO4RBV
