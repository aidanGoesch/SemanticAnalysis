My parents had just gotten a divorce and my dad decided he wanted to move to Florida, leaving my mom, whom I didn't have the best relationship with, and I, in Atlanta, GA. I've always been a daddy's girl but I kept a lot from my dad to maintain my innocence in his eyes. Following my parents' divorce, I started hanging out later, I was drinking, I was using marijuana, and I was promiscuous. My grades suffered and I had begun spending time with multiple guys just for the fun of it. I was filling a void that my dad could no longer fill. Though I was spending time with multiple guys, I had strong feelings for one, Joshua. Joshua was smart, funny, a good listener, popular, handsome, a gentleman, and still a tough guy. I knew I was a lucky girl so eventually I dropped the other guys and committed myself to Joshua. But prior to commitment, I made the mistake of sleeping with both Joshua, and another guy, Corey, around the same time. Two months later, I realized my period was late, I was nauseous all of the time, and I had weird sensations in my body that were flu like. I told my best friend Ashley at the time about my symptoms and she told me that she would go to the dollar store with me the following day to get a pregnancy test since they were just as reliable as the name brand tests, but cheap. The next day, Ashley and I went to the Dollar Tree and purchased three pregnancy tests just in case I messed one up. I took the test at her house since her parents weren't home and I didn't want to risk running in to my mom at home. It was at this time that I found out that I was pregnant. I was scared, worrying about what I would do with a baby, and wondering whose baby it was. My mom was disappointed, I couldn't tell my dad myself that his princess was pregnant, and while Ashley was excited, it wasn't enough support to raise a baby. I needed stability, support, a job, personal growth, and I needed to finish school. My only hope was Joshua but he was not too happy about the fact that I was unsure of who the baby's father was and respectfully told me that he wanted nothing to do with me but that he would be a friend and see my decision to the end with me. Corey also wanted nothing to do with me, as far as he was concerned, I was a hoe. I felt like my only option was to terminate my pregnancy. I cried days before ending my pregnancy, during the process, and days following the procedure. I was broken, and I felt alone and helpless because I never wanted to have an abortion but I had no one. Now five years later, I find out that my dad would have been willing to help me raise my baby had he have known I was with child, but neither me nor my mom mentioned it to him. Though I was happy to hear that my dad would have had my back through whatever, I am heartbroken that I terminated my pregnancy out of fear, and I don't know how soon i'll ever be able to forgive myself.",,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG0B2SU9
