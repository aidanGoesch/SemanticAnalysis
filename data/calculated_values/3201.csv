I experienced a death in my family as I watched my father pass away from complications of diabetes. I was never that close to my father growing up, as I didn't grow up with him for the majority of my life. My mother got a divorce with him when I was still a child and I lived with her all of my life. From time to time I would receive updates from my father, sometimes gifts for birthdays, but for the most part most of it was quiet. It wasn't until recently that I found out that my father's health was deteriorating rapidly. He moved up to New York coming from living in Florida all his life so I had more chances to see him and get to know him better as we ultimately knew that his life was not so certain anymore. I was still bitter from the rocky relationship that we had growing up, but I still forgave him. From our limited time together over the last couple of months he would tell me all types of stories from his childhood. Such his life growing up in Italy, to coming to America and working multiple jobs just to support himself. His life was rough and I started to find a new respect for my father after getting more details on his life. He apologized to me from what has become of our relationship and gave me his blessings for my future. He told me that I need to keep his memory alive to my wife and eventual family that I will build up. He finally passed away after many years of have diabetes that just worsened over time. Looking back on it I wasn't too upset because I finally got the chance to spend more time with him. I gained more insight on his life was a child and it gave me perspective on how I am today as a person. I am grateful for having a father and for the time I spent with him.",,3IFS6Q0HJJ5QQCWXG57FH155V8MIS7
