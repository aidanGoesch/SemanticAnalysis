It was super important for my profession. I took me way too many hours to do the exam. I felt like I was literally there all day. Don't even get me started on how long it took me to actually study for it. That took literal days if not weeks. I felt like a slave to my books and quizzes. Man I never want to have to go through that again. I can't even begin to describe how much stress I was under. The level of mental strength it took to get through this was something I don't know if I can summon again, that's how hard it was. I have never felt more relief than when it was all over. I didn't even care at that moment what my score was. I was just so happy that it was done and I didn't have to think about it anymore. I literally felt drained. A mental husk of what I used to be, sapped of everything that made me well me. Literally I felt like a brain zombie, nothing left over. What a struggle, I tell ya.",,3IGI0VL648636LFV643Y24RLT4DOND
