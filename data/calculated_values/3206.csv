It was the spring time so there wasn't really anything going on.  The weather was just starting to get warm.  My friend called and asked if I wanted to hang out with them.  Obviously, I agreed to it.  I had nothing better to do.  So, I went to my friend's house and we hung out and watched tv for a bit.  Then, my friend asks if I wanted to take some acid.  Occasionally, we do delve into some drugs, especially if we are bored.  I agreed and it went well.  After a bit, my friend asks me if I wanted to go to the bank with them.  Again, I had nothing better to do so I went along.  My friend lives in the city so it was just a couple of blocks away.  We ended up walking there and back completely barefoot.  It must have been the acid.  You should have seen the look on the teller's face when we walked in.  I'll never forget it.  That isn't even the crazies thing that happened that day.  After we got back to my friend's house, we actually ended up having sex.  Is it something we bring up all the time to each other?  No!  But I can find the humor in it.",,3IGI0VL648636LFV643Y24RLUOSONX
