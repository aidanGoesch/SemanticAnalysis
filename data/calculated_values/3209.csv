I went to the cinema to see a movie and on getting to the cinema i met my longtime friend, it was very pleasing because the last time i saw him was when we graduated high school. I called him by his name he was shocked that who can actually call him by this name, only his closed friends call him by this funny name, he looked and he tried to see who was calling him but he couldn't recognise me well enough because of my new look, beards and all. I went to meet him and i greeted him and after we both saw the movie we went out to talk about life and other things that has happened to us. We spoke about family, jobs, relationships and material possessions. The most amazing thing was that he now drives a Lamborghini aventador. I was so happy for him, he gave me his official card, he said i should email him with my resume. I mailed him with the resume immediately. He made a call and said ""don't worry you'll be paid three times your current wages"". We both laughed about it but he was serious, i saw it in his tone. Jokingly, I asked him when do i start?.he replied and said ""when i'm ready"". I said i'll have to quit my current job. We went to a restaurant not very far from the cinema. We ate and we left. He called me the second day that i've been offered a role in his firm. I was so delighted and happy about the news. I went to the company, he personally gave me a tour of the firm and made me welcomed. I was really surprised but it was overwhelming and i didn't know how what to say, than to say thank you my friend.",3IGI0VL648636LFV643Y24RLVQYON8,
