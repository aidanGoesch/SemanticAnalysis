I carried this child for approximately 3 months and fell I love with it.  I had an illness, aside from the pregnancy, at that time and knew that I would need some assistance in caring for the child.  The father of the child did not want to be a part of this baby's life so I ha no one to turn to but my parents.  The night before the abortion I ended up telling my mom what had happened and what was going to happen the next day.  I basically begged her for help at this point, and I remember saying how much I hated myself and how I did not want to go through with the procedure.  My mom told me that she had no choice but to tell my dad and I begged her not to, fearing his reaction.  This was the last interaction that I had with my mom and I was under the impression that she told my dad, as he did not say anything to me the entire night.  The next day I went through with the procedure.  For the past 18 years I thought that my dad knew about this until a few months ago.  My sister told me that he told her that he did not find out until 5 years after the fact that I was indeed pregnant.  He told me sister that my mom phrased it as a question to him, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  Instead of telling my mom that he would make me have the abortion he said that they would have no choice but to help me.  If I had known this 18 years ago I definitely would not have gone through with the procedure.  I still carry a good amount of guilt and hatred towards myself because of this and I now have trust issues.  If you cannot trust your own mother, who can you really trust in life.",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG0B2SU9,
