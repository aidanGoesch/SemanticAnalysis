Her brother, who has the bottom bunk, said she was scared by something she had seen in the window. I thought for sure he was joking, my daughter is not one to be easily startled. And honestly, it was a Saturday morning, so I really didn't understand why the twins were up this early anyhow. I went over to the window, just to be sure there was nothing there. And good Lord, there was a bobcat in the tree. I have heard on the news that the wildlife is moving into the suburban neighborhoods, mostly from our taking over their natural habitat with building new homes and businesses, but I hadn't really believed it until now. The cat was a pretty good size, about 40 pounds, and solid black. He gave me quite a start too.  I double checked my daughter to be sure she didn't have a concussion, and decided I had to call animal control. It really saddens me that we are pushing out the wildlife with our greed and selfishness and need to keep on building. Especially in Texas, I notice this happening too much. I wish we could live in harmony and build more environmentally by not destroying whole habitats. I made the choice against animal control, and called an animal rescue, relocation unit instead.  This isn't the ideal choice, but it was the best option I had at the time. The unit came and told me the cat would be taken to a state part out west. My daughter was ok, just startled, and this was a great teaching opportunity for us.",,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQB420P4Y
