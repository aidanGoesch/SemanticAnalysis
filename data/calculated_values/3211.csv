It started out when I had to work a double shift and came home ridiculously tired the night before. I had only slept a total of 4 hours before I heard the thud and the scream from my 7 year old son which felt like it filled the house. It was 6 am and I was immediately taken in an out of body experience which is all I can describe it as. I heard my son screaming for help and I immediately screamed for my wife because I thought I was going to find my daughter dead in her room. My son was crying over my daughter as she shook and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head. I was sure that she was choking on something and my son through tears kept telling me she may have swallowed a lego because they had been playing with them. I felt sick and told my wife to call the ambulance right away. We were screaming at each other and crying and I shoved my fingers in my daughters throat to try and get her airway clear because I was positive it was choking. I even started doing heart compresses. I thought she was going to be gone and I have never been more afraid. I felt myself outside of my body looking in at that moment. My son was terrified and I did not keep it together well for him. When the ambulance came my wife was sure it was a seizure by the way she was reacting after. She immediately fell asleep and we took her to the ER.
