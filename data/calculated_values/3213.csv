The trip was 1 week long so we were constantly going out and enjoying ourselves since we wanted to do a lot in such a short amount of time. Once we arrived we got settled at our hotel, and then the next day we went out to see the volcanoes and then went to dinner. The day after that we went horseback riding in the rain forest and saw lots of different trees as well as a waterfall. The horseback riding was the most memorable part of the trip, as we were able to slowly climb up the mountain through the rain forest, and then saw the sunset over the ocean. The views we saw on the horseback riding trip were amazing. I was surprised by the vastness of the ocean and the beauty of the sunset. The next day we went golfing and saw plenty of mongoose, wild birds, and goats along the course. The next day we enjoyed lazing around on the beach and going to a luau. I ended up getting a bit of a sunburn that day, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the rest of the trip. The day after that we went to a lagoon and saw dolphins and sea turtles swimming in the ocean. The next morning we spent driving to the airport where we could see plenty of rock formations. We had a layover in Oahu that was 12 hours long, so we were able to explore the city outside of the airport and saw some of the ocean and beaches. The flora was very similar to that of the big island, and was very beautiful. The plane ride was very long and the time change was difficult to adjust to, but I'm glad I was able to experience the wildlife of Hawaii.",,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBBLZP46
