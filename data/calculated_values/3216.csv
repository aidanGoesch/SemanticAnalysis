I always thought of chess as something of a “nerd sport”; less of a sport and more of an assignment .. like homework. It wasn’t until experiencing the play-through of chess and learning the significance of each piece that I began to take interest in it . Cut to a few months after my first game that I thought it would be an excellent idea to join the chess club, and eventually we found ourselves in a few tournaments; Everyone in my school that takes part in the tournament takes it very seriously. This isn’t like a game of connect four, where you go, “Aww, man,” and laugh when you’re defeated. When you lose, it means(at least to us, and the other teams taking part) that you have lost something more than a game. Although deep down we all know that this is just a game; We also love how dignified it all seems. How much respect we all have for the game is what brings us all together I think. We had put together a team that was relatively well-rounded or so we thought, until we were knee deep in losses and on our last game, which of course is very stressful, even for someone who doesn’t take it as seriously as us. We knew we would have to figure out a new strategy for next year and establish some new players. This would mean some players of the team would not be happy. But we probably would be. I knew that out of all the players, I wouldn’t be one of the ones being cut. I was one of the best players we had. I felt bad for what we would have to. Ultimately though, I knew the members would understand. We would absolutely need to balance out the teams weaknesses with more seasoned players. There was no doubt about that.",,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP54P0
