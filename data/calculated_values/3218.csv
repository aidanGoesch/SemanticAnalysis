Every 'last game' gets significantly harder as i know that each one brings closer my eventual last game forever. This season was especially rough because our team managed to not win a single game all season. Most of our losses were in complete blowouts where we couldnt even be competitive. Even through all the losing, baseball is still near and dear to my heart. I have an enormous passion for the game and losing will not diminish that at all. Im still looking forward to next season with just as much excitement and anticipation as my previous years. I can only hope that our young squad will return and show growth. In the past few years it feels like each year we lose a couple of our core players. Those losses are tough because good players are hard to replace. You hope that the few new people that you acquire will step up and fill those roles but it cant be counted on with certainty. It has gotten significantly harder to get to the games. One hindrance is distance, after moving a little further away it becomes daunting to drive 45+ minutes one way to get to a game after working all day. It means you get home late and lose sleep which impacts the following day at work.  One thing is certain, i will continue to show up and provide leadership for the newer and younger players. Baseball has, and will continue to be, a major passion of mine.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP54P0,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP54P0
