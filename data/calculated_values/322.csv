At the age of 18 I had an abortion.  The reason for the abortion was that I was going through an illness at the time and I would have needed some assistance, but was led to believe that no one would help me.  The night before the procedure I came home and told my mom what was going on.  I was crying, begging her to help me and I remember specifically stating that this was not something that I wanted to do and that I hated myself for doing so.  My mom told me that she was going to tell my father and, seeing as how he did not speak to me during that time, I was under the assumption that he knew and that was the reason that he chose not to speak to me. About 4 months ago, my sister disclosed that my mom did not tell my dad that I was pregnant as the time and instead phrased it as a question, asking what he would do if he found out that I was pregnant.  When he was asked this question my father stated that they would have no choice but to help me out.  This was never disclosed to me so I went ahead with the abortion, thinking that I had no one on my side.  To make matters even worse, my mom did not disclose my pregnancy to my father until 5 years after the fact.  I am now left carrying tremendous guilt and hatred for myself because of what I had done, and everything could have been avoided.  This revelation has opened up a new wound and I now feel as though I am dealing with this all over again.  I do not know what to say to my mom, let alone how to approach the topic altogether.  I now feel like a failure even more and I did not stand up for something that I loved dearly.  I want to talk to my mom about this but our family is in such discord now that I do not want to add any fuel to the fire.",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG0B2SU9,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG0B2SU9
