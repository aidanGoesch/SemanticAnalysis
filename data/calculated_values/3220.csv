It was a monumental blessing to find a team of phenomenal doctors, at a Baltimore Medical facility, that was working on a new experimental treatment.  While I didn't go into full remission, the treatment I received made it possible to walk my daughter down the aisle, actually a lakeside beach, on a beautiful day.  Also, being able to help my new son-in-law to be's mom, in coordinating the rehearsal dinner, was a huge pleasure.  She had lost her husband to cancer, when her son was only a young teenager.  We were wonderful partners, sharing in the hosting of the rehearsal dinner and the reception.  At the latter, I welled-up with tears, while enjoying the ""Bride/Father"" dance.  She had remembered, and selected, one of my favorite songs, ""The Prayer"", as sung by Andrea Boccelli and Celine Dion.  I was further surprised, and overjoyed, that she had segued another favorite by Elle King, the daughter of actor Rob Schneider.  It was such a fabulous few moments.  My daughter and I sailed around the dance floor, showing off with some intricate and jubilant dance moves.  Many of the guests would later ask if we had choreographed our dance.  And, finally, the greatest gift was seeing the family photos, afterward.  Just being able to be there for my daughter was so emotionally stirring.  And, now, as I continue my fight with cancer, her sister has given birth to my first grandchild.  There are some things that are beyond words.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP9P4P,
