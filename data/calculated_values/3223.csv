He not only took care of his children but also watched over his nieces and nephews.  He helped me become a better father and husband.  My son look on his as a surrogate grandfather.  My siblings and cousins had similar feelings. We came together from several states to celebrate this milestone birthday.  It was wonderful to catch up with everyone.  I hadn't seen one cousin in decades.  Although we hadn't been together much, we quickly reconnected.  We met new family members and shared memories.  It was especially nice to pay a tribute to this uncle. We stayed in a ranch house for several days so we had lots of time to visit.  We had a wonderful time. It was remarkable because of the instant reconnection.  We cooked meals together and made more memories.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBDEXP4S,
