This was a little unusual because they rarely called me. Our conversations were usually tense and extremely upsetting so I had slowly gotten used to the loneliness of not hearing from them. Anyway, it seems they were breaking up with their current romantic partner and they were very devastated. They told me that they had no friends and I was the only person that they could call. My heart ached for them but there was virtually nothing that I could do for them except listen. Eventually things got ironed out a little and it seemed like they were on a good path. We talked several times a week. Then the phone calls stopped again and I started to fear that they had gone back to their ex. I had found out that the ex supposedly hated me and did not allow my child to call me or answer the phone if I called them. After about ten days I did get in touch with them and yes they had gone to see their ex. Then they told me they were quitting their job and moving across the country to live with their ex and the ex's parents until they could find work. The last time I spoke to them was about three weeks ago when they were packing. Again, we had a very tense short conversation and then that was it. So, I googled what was going on between us and I found this thing called 'parent abandonment'. Just reading the words was like a punch in the gut. How could this be happening? Apparently it's something of a trend with the younger crowd. I read a few articles about it and then I decided I knew all I ever wanted to know about this. The best advice was from a women who had four children walk away from her at different points in their lives. And this brave soul said, ""Go out and live a full life because you did not abandon your children."" I'm working on that part now and I might even move.",,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBNAQ4P2
