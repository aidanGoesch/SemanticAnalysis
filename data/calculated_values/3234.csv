I was watering the plants, vegetables, and Cacti. I was feel kind of low due to not seeing many of my friends anymore due to everyone being busy with their own schedule, and work being a little slow was also on my mind. I may have been feeling sorry for myself, but the wounds were real. As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird. At first I thought he was just doing his early morning pollen rituals, but to my surprise he wanted water. The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose. I turned down the pressure of the hose to a fine mist and pointed the mist into the direction of the humming bird . The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time. If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream. It was great the bird had no fear of animosity of a human. He knew there was a human controlling the hose and he did not care he wanted water on this warm summer day. I felt great, I felt a connection with this little bird, we at this brief aquatic encounter were friends. It seemed that God saw my loneliness and sent me a friend. That small communal moment with nature make me feel better for the rest of the day. I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT
