I had been betting on volatility at the end of the year.   The market has seen volatility sink to all time lows.   I figured the only direction that things could go is up from here.   How silly was I.   As the saw goes:  the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent.  I was so convinced volatility would trend up I employed the largest dose of leverage I could get from my broker and levered it even more with options.  And then I compounded it by betting large on Bitcoin rising.  Can you say oh for two?  All of my options contracts expired at the end of the year worthless.   If volatility  has spiked or Bitcoin had popped I would have made a killing.  It would have been the best late Christmas or New Year's gift ever.    As it stands now I'm going to have to cut way back on my spending just to be able to pay off Christmas presents in 3 months.   What a tough situation to be in.  Why couldn't the market come around to my view?   My finances hurt and so does my brain.  I'll have to stay away from exotic trading instruments.,,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09963IRJ
