This is a day i cant forget because i tried trading Gold/USD. This pair did a heavy count on my head. From this is realized that the Forex  Market isnt a playground. I was really marveled by this occurrence. It was a little bit hard for me to take in. After over 4 months waiting patiently to go live and now having everything taken from me. Though from my end i knew i over leveraged because of my greed to make quick money. Who knows own a lamborghini thinking of this sometimes i tend to blame myself again. I am to be blamed for how everything went. I take full responsibility for the outcome of my actions. If there's one thing i learnt as well from this is to accept your fault and move on.  Trading Has never been more hard. I was really enlightened and see that this shouldn't be a hobby but profession. This was how the 1st of July 2019 Went for me.,,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09963IRJ
