Yes, he really did have a bear in his basement. At first, I don't know why he has this and even this is allowed to be in here. I didn't know how to react to this bear because I didn't expect it to be there at all. I had so much questions to my friend on why he has this bear in the first place. When I got there, I was in complete shock because it is bigger than I expected. This is a beautiful creature and I would like to pet it but I was scared. I talked to him about the bear and asked what is he going to do with it. He said hes going to keep it but I don't know how I feel about that. So I suggested that he should let him out of the wild because bears are not pets. We fought throughout the whole which got me really frustrated because I have no idea why would he keep it at all. I know that these are not meant to stay here and it should out there. I told him that I would take action if he doesn't let this bear free. At the end of the day, he told me I was right and we let him go. I knew he wanted to keep him but I know that its better for the bear more than him. We have to think about the bears happiness to not just my friend.",,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR099OOIR4
