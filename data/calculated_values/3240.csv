It was my friend Dave.   ""Steve!   I need you to come over and give me a hand!""   Now Dave and I had been friends for a while and he wasn't one to act really shocked or surprised without good reason.    ""Dude... Dave, I'm on my way into work, buddy.   This had better be earth shattering.""   I wasn't about to be late for work for no good reason.   My boss would be pissed if I just blew off work.   I wouldn't get fired, but I would have to endure his wrath afterwards.   ""Steve...""  There was silence for a minute.   ""Dave, if this is some drama between you and Diane, we can talk about it over a few beers after work.""    ""Steve... there's a bear in my basement.""   I didn't know what to say.   ""By bear... do you mean an old gay guy, or do you actually mean like Yogi bear?""   ""Dude, why the hell would I have an old gay guy in my basement?""   Okay, so I wasn't about to miss this.   I called my boss and told him I was gonna be late, but that I promised I would explain when I got in.   My boss was obviously a little cheesed, but he was okay with it.   So I got over to Dave's house and found his wife upstairs in a panic.   ""Diane, where's Dave.""    ""He's... he's at the steps.""    So I went over to the basement steps and sure enough, there was a black bear, maybe the size of a large dog curled up on what looked like an old blanket along the wall.   ""Well, okay, so you got a bear, congrats.""   ""I don't know what to do, man.""   I thought for a minute.   Let me call fish and game and see what they think.   I called the local game warden and told him.   He asked if there was anyone in danger and I told him the bear was sleeping and had probably pushed in a window.   The game warden gave me a number for a local trapper that had dealt with black bears before.   About an hour later, the trapper showed up and after 20 minutes or so, and $400 of Dave's money, the bear was gone.   I took some pictures of the bear so I could show the boss.   I went into work and showed my boss the pictures of the bear in Dave's basement and gave him the number of the trapper.   My boss took it in good stride and I got to work for the day.",3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR099OOIR4,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR099OOIR4
