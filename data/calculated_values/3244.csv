It was a waterfall.  It was an import ant place to him so I felt honored that he took me there.  It had all kinds of greenery with plants and flowers everywhere.  It smelled like fresh cut grass.  The sounds of the birds and water was very peaceful.  I saw the water come down over the tops of the mountain and splash into the reservoir below.  It had a very peaceful nature to it.  The small drops of water that hit my legs from the splash was just enough to spritz my legs.  The sun was warm and I felt wonderful.  I was at peace.  The time I spent with my boyfriend was wonderful.  We waded in the warm water for awhile and then we full submersed into the water.  We went behind the beautiful fall of the water where he took my face gently into his hand and kissed me.  What a wonderful day it was.,,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09IRURIY
