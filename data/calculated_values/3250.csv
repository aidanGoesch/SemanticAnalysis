At the time, we were given the opportunity to stay with the company and relocate to another state. The opportunity was appealing to us for a few reasons, the first being we lived on the property, so we would need to move anyway. The opportunity also involved moving south, which was one of our goals, as we were both born and raised in New England, and were tired of the cold winters. So we decided to proceed with the move from MA to FL, even though it involved me giving up a good paying job that I had been at for twelve plus years and we would be leaving all of our family and friends behind. We were in this venture together and were determined to make this move work in our favor. Having never moved far from home, I don't think either of us realized how much work and stress is involved in packing up your life and moving to another region of the county. I should also mention we had about one month from the time the offer was made to the date we were scheduled to move, and we were both working full-time right up until the day before we moved. It was a very emotional time for both of us, and stress was running high. As we set of on our road trip, we became excited to see what the future would hold for us. My husband was scheduled to start work a few days after we arrived, but our moving truck was delayed and didn't arrive until the day before he started. I did not have a job lined up, as I planned to take some time and get us settled before searching for a job. My husbands job was extremely stressful from the start. The team was understaffed and the property had a number of issues that needed to be resolved. His stress level ran extremely high and he was working 12-14 hour days, 7 days a week. Two months into this experience, we found it was time to make a decision regarding my husband staying on in this role. He'd spoken to supervisors a number of time regarding the issues he was facing at work and nothing seemed to be changing. He was loosing weight, not sleeping, not eating well, constantly working, and continuously worrying about work. After much discussion (some heated at times) and consultations with family/friends, we made the decision for him to resign from his position. We realized this would mean we were both now unemployed and homeless, which means moving back to stay with family in MA. The movers arrive in just over a week to bring us back to MA, so once again I am preparing the task of packing up our lives to move, with no idea what the future holds for us.",,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09KEORI4
