I remember being in the ER room with my mother, wondering what in the world could be causing her limp left arm. Overhearing the ER doctor commenting how sad it was that my mother had suffered a stroke, without her realizing what was taking place, having the sympathy looks. I remember having the most horrid scenarios implicating a life with my mother as a stroke victim. When we were moved to an inpatient room, we were seen by an array of doctors. every single imaging testing was conducted. within the span of 48 hours mom had over 4 imaging test and constant blood testing. Sleeping in a hospital room for a total of 2 nights, watching over my mother made me realized, how much my mother had age, her vulnerability in the moment, and how dependent of my care she was, it was the most gut wrenching feeling i had ever experience, i can feel it right now in the center of my chest. it took a full body imaging to give us the answer we were all looking for. finally on the 3rd day, we received results that my mother had over 70% rotatory cuff tear, the ligament was hanging by thread which was causing stroke like symptoms. I remember my brother and i exchanging looks, realizing we were going to be more than okay. the look of relief in my mothers eyes, i will never forget, i will also never forget on the drive back she was so worried she was going to become a burden for me. which that will never be the case, i love my mother and i am honor to be able to take care of her. a total of 3 days of being in the dark with different diagnosis being thrown at us, with possibilities of disabilities to deal with. Never in my life will i ever want to experience something of that nature. i feel emotionally drained at the thought. I also despise that the ER doctor was so bold and abrasive and make a diagnosis on the spot with all of the testing done and results on hand. making such diagnosis without considering the families worries and pain, is truly insensitive and torturous.",3IKZ72A5B529082271K8FAI710DNFB,
