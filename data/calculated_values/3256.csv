I was preparing breakfast, when my mother called and said she was not feeling well, to please email her employer in her behalf since she seemed to not be able to look at the computer or phone screen for too long without having a serious dizzy spell. i did as she asked, email her employer, and decided to spend the rest of the day with mom. upon arriving, i immediately noticed my mother had red dots all over her left side, not chicken pox dots but capillary pain/stressed dots. she then told me she had no movement in her left arm and her lower back was hurting, her lower back had never hurt to that extent. i made the decision of taking her to the emergency room. i filled all of the paper work, asked what was her symptoms and as soon as i explain what she was feeling a team of nurses and doctors rushed her in to a room, i was asked to wait outside. the moment ive seen more than 4 medical professionals rush my mom into a room, i felt like my entire being had shattered, i felt this overwhelming sensation all over my body as if i was loosing control of the situation and did not know if to cry, pace, talk to someone. a nurse came with me and said my mom ER doctor wanted to speak to me, the ER doctor said my mother was experiencing a stroke. signed all of the paper work, while all i wanted to do was crawl into my moms bed and tell her everything was going to be okay, pinching myself that wasnt happening. called my brother, he immediately arrived and we both had each other for support. the doctors order a series of test that took a total of 3 days. on the final day, we were waiting to see what life was going to look. unbeknownst to us we received the best news any kids whose mother had been diagnosed with a stroke could ever receive, my mother did not have a stroke but rather had 70% rotator cuff tear! i felt like my knees gave out. i was overwhelmed with joy. though it was a serious tear it was nothing to what was happening before. In that moment i realized how much i needed my mom, i needed her to be okay. in that moment i realized how blessed we were to have a healthy mom with all of her functions and capabilities. in a instant i felt i had lost half of my mom to feeling i had regain her. as i type this i feel the anxious feelings i was feeling in the moment radiating from my chest and enveloping the rest of my body.",3IKZ72A5B529082271K8FAI710DNFB,3IKZ72A5B529082271K8FAI710DNFB
