Not only am I totally pissed, I am sick to my stomach. I don't want him back in this house.  But there is nothing I can do.  He legally owns half the house.  I am beside myself.  I can't stand the guy.  Just looking at him repulses me.  He says he has no where else to go.  His ex wife and kids kicked him out.  He doesn't own the house they live in, so he can't force them to let him stay.  Meantime, over here, I wish there was some way to stop him from coming back.  I guess I'll finally have to file for divorce even if I don't have the money, because I am not living with him.  This is gonna be hell until I can figure something out.  I'm thinking of moving to California where my younger son lives.  Get a fresh start somewhere else.  And get as far away as I can from this person.  I know one thing, I can't live with him.  I will do whatever I have to, to get away from him.",3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZICR68U,3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZICR68U
