Not only do I think about that night, I dream about it. And so does Jimmy (my husband). When we assumed the role as Dad's caregivers and moved in to his home - the house in which I was raised - constantly reminding him to use his walker when he moved through the house (and picking him up off the floor when he didn't) became an all-too-common occurrence. But when we heard the loud thud upstairs the night he died, I think we both knew this fall sounded different. God how I wish we were wrong. That memory feels like yesterday. I miss Dad so much and still think about him every day. When I recall seeing him lying face down in the tub where he had fallen head-first, the nightmare comes flooding to my mind. They say we don't remember certain traumatic events, rather we tend to block all memory from our minds. This is quite the opposite. I remember every minute of that tragic event like it occurred last night! The 911 call. Jimmy trying desperately to revive Dad. Seeing the ambulance pull up and the paramedics rush in. Calling my brother, who was vacationing in Las Vegas at the time, to ask about Dad's do-not-resuscitate order. Talking to my twin brother as Jimmy stayed by Dad's side, desperate for reassurance that everything was going to be ok. After all, that's why we moved in to take care of him. So he wouldn't have to give up his home and belongings, as well as a lifetime of cherished memories they created there, to go live in a ""facility"" with strangers. And plus, I intended to keep the promise I made to Mom on her deathbed: that I would do everything I could to make sure Dad lived out his days in the home they created for our family. I just hope they both are watching over me, knowing that the great love I have for them still overshadows the sadness and grief I still feel.",3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZICR86W,
