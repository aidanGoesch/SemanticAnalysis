Her and her dad lost contact about 4 years before his death and he has been dead now for 6 years, so it has been awhile. Since they lost contact so long before his death, she is not really aware of the circumstances surrounding his death. His death was not natural, and it was a very traumatic experience for me and my kids. I have been really worried that she is going to want me to re-live the time period leading up to and around his death. I was  diagnosed with PTSD after his death, so to say this has been a trigger for me is quite the understatement. While it has been a very difficult thing for me to wrap my head around, I can't shy away from it. This is his daughter, she has a right to know what happened, and I'm the only one who can really tell her. I have increased my visits with my therapist and am doing my best to work through this in a productive way. I need to be able to communicate with her clearly, and without being a mess. So far, she has told me that she isn't ready to hear the story, which is really a blessing. It gives us both time to get ready. Her to hear, and me to tell. It gives me time to work with my therapist to be mentally and emotionally prepared for this. I am really optimistic that this can be a good thing in the long run for us both. I would love for her to be able to meet her little half brother and have a connection with him, and him with her. His dad died when he was only 8 months old so I think he could learn a lot from her about him. She could tell him stories that I don't know.",3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZKTU86Z,
