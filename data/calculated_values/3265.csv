All of these things happened before we met. Six years ago, my husband passed away, and this year, the oldest of the two children turned 18. This young lady recently found me on facebook, and sent me a personal message. She wanted to express her condolences for my loss. As she is just 18, and just found out that her father is now deceased, she is very overwhelmed. She has grown into a beautiful young lady though, and I am hopeful that we will be able to get together and share out memories. The circumstances around her dads death were not pleasant. He died by suicide, and part of the reason was because of what happened with the girls and the fact that he was their dad and couldn't protect them and then lost them forever. I am overwhelmed by the situation because even though right now she is not ready to hear the story or the details, I know that eventually she is going to want me to relive everything that happened over the last couple of years of her dads life. I have saved things for her and her sister all these years that my husband had in his possession. I have pictures, and home movies, and their quilts from when they were babies. I am letting her come to me on her own accord, in her own time. I am hopeful to one day have a relationship with her. My husband and I had a son together, and so they have a half brother. I hope that one day they can meet him.",3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZKTU86Z,3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZKTU86Z
