He's still struggling to understand why he was fired, and it has been causing unwanted tensions in our relationship lately as he struggles to find a new job. My husband believes the company lied about why he was fired and he has found proof about it. We're trying to figure out what to do now. Should we get a lawyer? Do we contact the company directly? I'm not sure at this point. We are thinking of taking legal action and have been asking around if we have a legitimate case. Right now we're just in the preliminary stages. My husband isn't the kind of person to just shrug it off and move on, he will continue to search for answers. Hopefully we make some progress soon as it is starting to take a toll on our relationship. My husband has been a bit depressed and angry lately. It's a side of him that I had never seen before. Of course I want to support my husband, I just hope this is not a lost cause. We've scheduled a meeting with an attorney this week to talk about the possibility of wrongful termination. I hope to get some more professional insight as everything we've learned so far has just been off of our own research on the internet and talking to some close friends and family. However, our friends and family have never dealt with anything like this themselves. So we're anxious to see what the lawyer has to say on the matter.",,3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZLVB68J
