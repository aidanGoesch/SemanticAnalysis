What a great day for a birthday party. We had planned to host the party inside, using the garage as the big room for the pinata and party games but it was so glorious out that we moved everything to the yard. The birthday boy was eager to see all of his friends and cousins from up north. We planned to start the party at 12 pm but of course, the day started much earlier than that. We had to get up early and put the final touches on the decorations and I went to the bakers at 10 am when they opened to get the custom cake we had made. We decided on a space theme for the party since the birthday boy loved amatuer astronomy. The cake was a gorgeous representation of a fantasty sci-fi spaceship. The pinata was the planet earth. And some of the party favors were glow in the dark stars, along with the typical candy. The main colors were blues and blacks, which doesn't sound super festive but when we had put it all together looked glorious.  Soon it was time for the guests to arrive. Aside from the family, the first guest was his best friend, of course, those two were inseperable. I loved seeing them going through life together, helping each other and celebrating the good times. The party went off well and the birthday boy enjoyed every minute of it. Sometimes I worry about throwing lavish parties for the kids, because it becomes an issue of how to re-create the excitement from previous parties, but also life is short and the good times should be celebrated.  For my birthday I want to relax on the beach.",,3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZUT268F
