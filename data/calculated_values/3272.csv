My Family and I, had wanted to do something fun for Hoyt. He don't have many friends in school, and we do not live close to family members. So we decided to take him somewhere special, we have never been to before. Hoyt and his sister Kyah, have always asked and pointed out, and asked to go to, where we took Hoyt and surprised him, August seventeenth of two-thousand nineteen. We went to Wild Waves, it was very emotional and touching, as myself as an adult has never been to, Wild Waves before. It was a great memory, we got to make as a family, and also celebrate the birth of my son, seven years ago. We had a lot of fun, we rode some rides, the most memorable one was the 1906 carousel, it was not to be involved with a part of history. We rode a couple other rides as a family, the kids did some of the smaller kid rides just themselves. We had lunch and then visited the water park! There was lots to do, water slides,the activity pool and even Hook's Lagoon. We changed into bathing suits and explored the water park as a family. We floated the lazy river on a rental tube, and enjoyed the thrill of the water slides. Kyah even jumped off a rock in the activity pool. We spent the last hours of the day at Hook's Lagoon letting Hoyt play with the younger kids his age, and do the little kid water slides.",,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR50516E
