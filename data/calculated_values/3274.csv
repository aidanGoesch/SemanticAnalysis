A couple of months prior to that, I had maxed out my credit card to pay for another month at the apartment. The person I was living with, had a scare with their car and just stopped trying. Even after the scare was over, this person was unwilling to keep working. They also happened to by my ride to work. I had to think fast and find another source of employment, which coincidentally, led me back to this site. I found work as a freelancer, but the inconsistent nature of the work, meant that once again, I would have an issue with having enough money to pay rent. Fast forward back to 7 months ago, worked had picked up, but they were asking me to pay 2 months of rent. I just did not have it. So, under the invitation of a family member, I booked a train and convinced the person I was living with to come with me rather than be homeless. I threw away everything that could not be fit into my bags and moved across the country. Now, I'm paying less rent, but income is still unstable. I also have more debt than I'd ever had. Even though the person I lived with shares this debt with me, I am the only one paying. I am also the only one paying rent. I'm frustrated and stressed most of the time, but I know I will get through this. I just need to stay focused.",3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR50561J,
