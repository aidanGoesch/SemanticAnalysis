The catch, however, is that they were on the other side of the country. Since I did not have a car and did not want to rent one, I decided to take the train. I chose the train, because I was able to have take several bags with me. On a plane, I would at most be able to take a carry-on and a checked bag. On the train, I could have two carry-ons and two checked bags. Once I booked my ticket, it was time for me sort through all my belongings. Even though I could have more luggage on the train, I could not take everything with me. As such, I had to throw out over half of what I owned. I had previously given away 90% of my books, and now I had to give away half of what was left. This was in addition to giving away most of my already limited amount of shoes, a bed, clothes, kitchenware, and many other things. It was difficult, but with enough detachment and my walks up and down several flights of stairs, I did it. While the move was difficult emotionally, I learned a valuable lesson. I learned about what was essential and nonessential. I learned the consequences of choices I had made that led me to having to move across the country. Finally, I learned to let go. While I hope that my next move will be under different circumstances, I know that I will have the emotional strength to handle whatever emergency situation that comes my way.",3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR50561J,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR50561J
