It started early in the day, and my parents came by and picked me up at my house.  Everyone was in a very somber mood, but it was sunny and quite warm.  We drove out to a church about thirty minutes away near where my mom grew up, and while driving I couldn't help but think back to all the good memories I had with my cousin.  She was always so happy and nice and just fun to be around.  But now, that was all gone, and all I had were the memories that were going over in my mind. Arriving at the church and seeing all of my family, it was hard.  It was just so sad, all of it.  Seeing my aunt was the hardest part I think, but I knew then that she was strong and was going to be able to get past this. My uncle is an ordained pastor, so he was able to help with the service and I think that helped ease some of the pain.  After the service we all went to the cemetery and gathered up on the hill in the shade.  Seeing the final resting place really hit me hard, I started to cry much harder than I had been all day at that point.  All of the memories and the final shock to my brain that she was never coming back, made me very sad, and made me miss her dearly.  We then all met at a local place where they served a late lunch and we had some drinks.  It was good to see so many of my family, but at the same time, so sad, because I thought that we shouldn't be seeing each other, at least not for this reason.  I didn't really know how to feel when we left and I made it back home.  I was deeply saddened, and just thought of how my aunt, uncle, and cousins felt.  I know that life had changed for them forever, and now life was starting again without their dear one, and that hurt me again.  But my family is strong, and stronger together, and I know we will get through this like we will any other tragedy that comes our way.",,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG9CISU0
