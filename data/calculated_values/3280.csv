During the time of writing this diary entry, I had not seen them. Recently, my father and I went on a vacation to his home country. I hadn't seen my father in six months. During this time i was able to visit family and hang out with friends. Visiting my fathers country was very rewarding but also very tiring. We walked for miles an d took public transportation everywhere. We ate a lot of food that was delicious. A downside to the trip was getting sick. I am not quite sure what i had. I suspect it was either food poisoning or sun poisoning. It's hard to pinpoint as we ate at many restaurants that did not have healthy options and I had gotten a severe sunburn. I had a fever for a few days and had stomach issues the days following up to today. It was a great trip to bond with my dad and to explore the area where he grew up. I hope to come back in the near future.",3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSRWD061V,
