At first i was not affected by the distance. I didn't think it to be much of a big deal. It's been a few months and I find myself missing them. I know i do not like showing gratitude to my siblings or parents but now that i am away i appreciate them more than ever. I miss how every weekend i would do an activity with my parents. Mainly my father. We would do many things but there were some activities that i adored doing. Like going thrift shopping. The excitement of finding something invaluable. Maybe something from my childhood or his. I loved going out to eat and finding a new place or frequenting the Denny's we love. It might all seem silly but i truly miss them. My mother and i would walk around the mall. We'd run errands or do window shopping. Wed walk for hours on local trails. I love that. I can't wait to be home in a few weeks. I am really looking forward to it.,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSRWD061V,
