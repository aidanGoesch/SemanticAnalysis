I'm exhausted but in a good way. It's been a whirlwind since starting this job about a month and a half ago but it's worth it. Honestly, I can't believe that I'm here. I never imagined that I'd be working for a company such as this. Thank god for Prof. J (which reminds me..purchase birthday card for Prof. J). I don't know if I would of pass her class and did so well on the certification exam two months ago without her encouragement.  It was a tough ride. I can't believe I'm here now. I remember the night before taking my exam, I barely slept, I was so nervous. When Prof. J told me that I had done so well on my exam, I couldn't believe it. What a moment.",,3IQ1VMJRYU6TFFH0VBFBJ8CWAE3A9J
