I had been going to school for two years in preparation for this exam, had several study books and systems and websites to help. I ended up being the first person in my class to take the exam, which was very stressful because I usually like to wait and see how other people will do first. This is unlike me, but with pressure from my family I decided to go for it. I was extremely anxious the weeks leading up to the exam. I knew I needed to get it over with and that I would feel much better for it when it was all over. I needed an 800 to pass the exam, and when I finally took it I ended up getting a great score. I was shocked that I received a 779 out of 800! I was so proud of myself because I was so scared that I wouldn't even pass at all. Later that month, when the rest of the scores from my class came in, and the director of my program personally texted me. I was nervous because I didn't know what it was about. She then told me that I had gotten the highest score she had never seen! I was so happy I cried tears of joy. I never thought I would be able to do so well. When I heard I had the highest score the director had ever seen I was over the moon.",,3IQ1VMJRYU6TFFH0VBFBJ8CWAE3A9J
