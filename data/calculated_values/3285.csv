I would like to share my thoughts about this event here. Our household has just one car and on that day my husband had taken the car with him. I was with my daughter at home when the incident happened. My daughter went on a bike ride and accidentally fell down from her bike. She was hurt and she somehow biked back to the house. Our home has an internet phone and as the internet was out, the phone was not working. I was distressed and did not know what to do. I came out into the street. I have a physical disability and it is tough for me to walk. But I somehow managed to get out of the house and tried drawing my neighbor's attention. That day no one was around. After about 10 minutes, my neighbor just happened to show up and she took things into her hands immediately. We drove to the nearest urgent care with my daughter and everything worked out fine. My daughter was shaken but not seriously hurt. I was beyond relieved and very thankful for my neighbor's timely help. I have since gotten a cell phone and taken steps to be more prepared for such emergencies. But I will forever remember my neighbor who showed up from nowhere in my time of need! My neighbor and I became close friends since and I believe this is a start of a beautiful relationship. My daughter too adores her. My neighbor often compliments me and my parenting as well as how I mange my life with dignity. I in turn admire her tenacity and her willingness to help everyone! I believe God comes to us through kind people and this incident is a true marker for the same.",,3IQ1VMJRYU6TFFH0VBFBJ8CWAHUA9G
