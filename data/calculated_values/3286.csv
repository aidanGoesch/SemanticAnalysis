I had been playing a lot of video games. I decided to do something that would contribute to society. I considered volunteering at the homeless shelter but they wanted a bigger commitment than I could give. I had cats growing up so I decided helping out with the Animal Defense League would be a good use of my time. I was first drawn to the cats but the dogs started to grow on me. They were something new to me, having only grown up with cats. There was a particular golden shepard that I felt an instant connection with. He was 3 years old. Through my time at AFL I learned he was available for adoption. After short consideration I knew I was in a comfortable place to bring a dog into my home.  I decided to adopt that golden shepard.  I have named him Bruno. I have had a great month with him. I look forward to several more years together.",,3IQ1VMJRYU6TFFH0VBFBJ8CWAJAA90
