I remember going into work and i was attacked by a patient.  He was a schizophrenic patient .  When he attacked me my shoulder ended up being dislocated immediately .  He did not strike me in the face since he had a mental disorder i dont think he knew what he was doing.  This was a very scary moment at work. I must say that have not had a more scary moment at work in my life.  I am not very up set about this due to his mental issues.  I did however make sure to be more careful at work. You can never be too careful in life.  So i do have my gaurd up more when i am at work now. I always make sure to be aware of my surroundings. I was considering quitting my job . I decided to stay at my job because this is a passion of mine.  Later after he attacked me he was sent to a safety room.   He needed some time to cool down.  He eventually cooled down.  He did say sorry later  and i did forgive him.,,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI19E6C7
