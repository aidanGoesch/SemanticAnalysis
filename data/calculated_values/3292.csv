I was working at a hospital on the west coastâ€”specifically, on the psychiatric unit. I had been assigned to a schizophrenic patient who had displayed severe aggression in his last admission. I had remembered this specifically from his last admission, and I thought I would be more prepared to handle him. Boy, was I wrong. In a matter of seconds after introducing myself, he jumped from his seat and grabbed my left arm. My shoulder dislocated nearly immediately, rendering me completely defenseless. Thankfully, he threw no punches at me, but he held onto my arms as I called for help. Eventually a nurse was able to push him back, and in that adrenaline rush I grabbed him with my good arm to take him to seclusion with the nurse. Somehow, with my dislocated arm, we were able to escort him to the seclusion room for unit safety. It is one of the craziest things I had ever experienced, and to this day I still have nightmares about it. Today, I still do not have 100% range of motion in my shoulder or arm, and I think that will be the case forever. It was a very bad thing to happen to me, and I am fortunate it did not get any worse. It is a crazy thing to remember as I write this and it still affects me emotionally. Fortunately, I have been able to use some mindfulness meditation to get it off my mind whenever the memory creeps up on me.",,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI19E6C7
