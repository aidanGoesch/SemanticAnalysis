But on this day, I was actually excited. It was my father's birthday, and I would be taking him to his doctor's appointment. He was long past the days of enjoying his birthday. To him this would just be any other day. But for me, I couldn't wait to surprise him. We went through the appointment, and luckily my dad's health was recovering after a recent health scare. This was such great news to start off the day. After the appointment, I took my dad to his favorite restaurant, which he wasn't expecting. He was so happy that he gave me a big hug. My dad isn't the most affectionate guy, so the hug was very much appreciated. I'll never forget that day. My dad was so incredibly happy. I only just wish mom could have came. That would have made it even better.",,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI84RC6N
