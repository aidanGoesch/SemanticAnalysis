I had to drive my dad down the hill for his doctor appointment. We do that about five times a year. My little brother came along for the trip now that he's graduated school. We three typically do all of our trips and/or errands together. It was good doctor's visit, nothing out of the ordinary, and nothing distressing. This took place in May right after mother's day. My mother and I have never been close, I've always favored my dad. His 59th birthday was the following week after this doctor's appointment. Rather than taking the freeway home like we normally do, I decided to surprise him with taking a side trip out to his favorite restaurant which we hadn't been to in over 10 years because it's so far away. It was a great surprise, he was so happy. The place smelled as good as we remembered and there was no wait. Since it had been so long my brother actually liked the food there, and it was fun seeing the fourth generation of our family finally join in on the restaurant tradition. Then when the bill came I took it and paid for it with money from my new (and first) job. It was just a really good feeling seeing my dad's face when he knew I was taking care of him the way I was. Like everything was going to be ok now. He still talks about that day even months later. I just love knowing that I was the reason he keeps having that smile on his face. It was a really good day.",3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI84RC6N,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI84RC6N
