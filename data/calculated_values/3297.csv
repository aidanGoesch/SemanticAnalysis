I'm looking for another part time job .  At the moment I'm not having much luck. So I decided to fast & pray . I went two days without out food and fell out of my bed. I felt awful .  It has been advised to me by a physician because of my undiagnosed blood disorder not to fast! When I began to eat again I started vomiting. I wish my health was back to normal again .  Every since that first hospitalization I have never been one hundred percent. Fasting in the past worked for my anxiety. Fasting also helps with my attention span. My  total recall is improved with fasting.  With my undiagnosed blood disorder I'm not able to live life without worry. I must always have a phone . I also alert people around me of my disorder just incase I faint with my eyes open . To the untrained eye I may look dead. People my be afraid to call 911 not knowing whats going on. I don't mind telling them because they may just have to save my life. I feel vulnerable with my fate in the hands of strangers.  All I can do is try and live my best life.,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBIAKG6C4,
