She is everything anyone could ever ask for. I have gotten to know her more and more each day. We have gotten a lot closer since then. We have really opened up ourselves to one another. I have never been vulnerable in my entire life until her. She has made me want to be a better person. She shows me unconditional love. She is always motivating and pushing me. She supports me no matter what. She is a once in a lifetime love. She has given herself to me in so many ways. I never thought love like this existed. I always just thought it was only in the movies. I'm a lot more humble and grateful because of her.,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGPLUSUA,
