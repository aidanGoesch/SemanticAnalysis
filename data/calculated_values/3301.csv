I was fortunate to be given the opportunity that I was. I was so appreciative that they were going to give me a chance. I really was under-qualified for the position. Even I can admit that I was probably going to be in over my head. I went to the job interview with the best attitude I could. I tried to be positive and talk about what I knew I was capable of. It worked! They gave me the position. I got a huge office and a big salary. I was so happy I could have exploded. It has been tough. I am trying to learn a business I know nothing about while managing a department. Some of the senior executives have said they are surprised by how I am performing. I guess they expected me to fail. I am proud of myself for taking this opportunity and climbing the ladder at the new company.,,3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K59IJJSJ
