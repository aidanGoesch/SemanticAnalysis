I can not recall all of the details of the story because I wasn't there. I wasn't there and so I can't recall the details in full so I will tell you details my daughter recalled to me. Specifically the one I was told about by my daughter. I made it all up because I was ghosted from going to the ceremony, and because at the time I was desperate for any work that paid. Yes, he got married. Yes he had a long courtship and married a girl he is compatible with. I don't think that the marriage will last because she will see past the person she thinks she married and see the callous shell of a person he is. Here is the most memorable thing that happened at the wedding. At the wedding they had a friend that is a Taylor Swift impersonator. It was one of my daughter-in-laws best friends and supposedly she looks just like Taylor Swift. She sang at the wedding and impressed people with how similar she looks. She was a really good singer and my daughter said she even sounds like her when she talks to people. The signifance to me of my son getting married is huge and has been eating at me ever since. I did the best I knew how with my son, tried my damndest to raise him right and to be ghosted from his wedding really sucks. It hurts like no other feeeling I've had because it wasn't just the wedding it is completely. That's about all I want to write at this time, just hurts to bad.",3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5HA6JSY,
