Not only my wife, but my son as well have been captured by the demons of alcohol. About 6 weeks ago, however, I had an important revelation. Heaven knows have tried to help both of them. I have taken them to rehabilitation centers. I have taken them to the doctor who have prescribed a variety of pills to help wean them from their alcoholic ways. But nothing worked for long. Meanwhile, the expenses mounted. Although I make a good salary. I could barely afford to put food on the table. So what happened 6 weeks ago? 6 weeks ago, I decided that I would stop by being a victim. I realized that nothing I could possibly do would help, either of these alkies. And I also realize that I had become afraid. Afraid of your own wife and son? It seems hard to believe. But it is oh so true.",,3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG
