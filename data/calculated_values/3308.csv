Over the years I've loaned them quite a bit of money (which they never repay) when I've been optimistic that they're straightening out their lives and need help to move forward.  This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.  He asked me if he could borrow $250 which he'd repay when he got a check in the mail in a few days and I foolishly agreed.  The check did come and he called me and said he was coming right over with the money and asked if he could do some laundry.  I haven't seen him since.  He took the money and paid for some more nights in the motel room and lots of vodka.  I was taking care of his dog who howled all day and night with separation anxiety.  I've been worried and scared for my son's health and safety for a long time but after this incident, that's changed into anger and fear for my own safety from people who absolutely put alcohol ahead of everything in life.  It was a new low since before lying and stealing hadn't been part of the picture.",3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG,3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG
