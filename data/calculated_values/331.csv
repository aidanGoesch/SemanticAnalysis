So I've been talking to this person for quite some time now. Just recently we got a little more romantically involved. I thought we would just be good friends. I ended up catching feelings. I never really thought anything would come of it. We lived on the opposite sides of the US. I recently moved though to Central America and they were visiting close by. So I drove down there to meet them. And holy smokes. I'm glad I did. She changed my whole world. I knew we had a connection over the phone and etc. But dang, when we met in person, you could just feel the love. This event is important because she's important. She's my future.",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGPLUSUA,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGPLUSUA
