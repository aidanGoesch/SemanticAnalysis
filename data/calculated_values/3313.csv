This was my first time ever meeting someone from an online chat and it was a very exciting experience. We had a full vacation planned and did many things such as rock hounding, ren fest, dave and busters and many bonfires. We clicked on a level I didn't think I would be able to click with someone else. I instantly felt a deep connection when meeting this person online. It was a pleasure to actually get to see her face, hug her and just talk to her in a real situation and it was fantastic to just be with her. I felt like a part of me that was missing was finally here. The first day we met, we went to the lake. It was wonderful to see her face as she realized the expanse of this lake. Playing in the water and collecting rocks for our rock hounding was so much fun. When we were done, we compared rocks and laughed over who found what and who had the prettiest. Sitting by the bonfire and just talking was so calming and peaceful. The heat of the fire, the flames burning bright in the dark night made for a surreal environment. Then going to ren fest, we both dressed up as different characters and boy did we laugh. It was hot outside and sticky but we had fun laughing and playing our roles. Overall, this was a very rewarding and fulfilling experience.",3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC,3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC
