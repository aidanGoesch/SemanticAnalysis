Of course, the time I spent looking for a job was stressful.  There were times when I thought that I would never find another job and that I would end up living on the street.  I thought this even though I knew that I could survive off of my savings for a few months and that I had marketable skills.  Still, it was a stressful time.  There were times when I thought that I should have just stayed with the soul-sucking miserable job that paid well.  More importantly though, I realized that life is too short to stay in a job just because it pays well.  I know that some people need to stay in miserable jobs because they have no other choice but I am talking about a different situation.  For me, everybody said that my first year associate position at a Big Law firm was what everybody is supposed to want and that it would be the ticket to happiness.  I was made to feel that walking away from the job that had me working 65 hours/week, waking up stressed, not seeing family and friends and losing myself was what I was supposed to do.  I felt like I would have thrown my education away if I quit.  I now have a job that I love.  While I make a bit less money, I am able to achieve the perverbial work-life balance.  I worl 40 hours//week and really like  my co-workers.  Also, I am given substantially more responsibility in this job so I think that I will grow more professionally.  I do not regret my decision in the least.  I realized that I need to live my life for me - not for others.",,3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N33VGKWU
