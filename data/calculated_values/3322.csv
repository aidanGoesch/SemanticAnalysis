My dr was a little concerned so she said to get blood work and she wanted me to come back that friday and we would check again. well i came back on that friday and my blood pressure was real high and i had uric acid in my system so i was going preeclampsia. well the dr sent me striaght to the hospital and i was getting induced. it was another long and painful process  of induction. but after a long 34 hours our baby boy was here and i was able to hold him and kiss him and feed him. i was so happy and so over joyed that that pain and hardach was complete worth every second of it. I was able to introduce my 1st son to his baby brother and i could have not imaged a more memoriable happy moment.,3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N3VY9WKX,3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N3VY9WKX
