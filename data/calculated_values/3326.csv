I can't believe it. Where would I go if she sells the house? I would have nowhere to go. This wouldn't do. This wouldn't do at all. I tried to persuade her. To keep the house. After all, it's a great house. Why would she even sell it. That's not a good idea at all. If she sells it I would have nowhere to go. In the end, I didn't manage to persuade her and she sold the house anyways. That was a horrible way for me to get kicked out of the place I was living at, but in the end I managed to find another place, even though I didn't like it as much. Oh well, at least I have a place to live at now. It's not so bad.",,3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9UA3RJ1
