She was moving in with her fiancee, and selling her house. I was devastated. Partially because I really liked living there, and partially because I know how difficult it is to find affordable housing. She gave me about 6 weeks notice, but that didn't seem like very much time, at the time. I immediately got online and started looking for rentals. It was very difficult and frustrating, because my budget is so small. It was difficult to find places that I could afford the rent in the first place. Secondly, most places require you to have an income of 3 times the rent. I understand the sentiment behind it, but damn! I don't know how people afford to rent! I really wanted a place of my own, I really don't like having room mates. My situation with her could not have been better, but I just prefer to live alone. I spent the next 4 weeks pouring over rental advertisements, and looked at countless possibilities. But they were all either too small (just a one room studio with a bathroom) or I didn't meet the income requirements. I finally ended up settling for a roommate situation again, because the deadline to move was quickly approaching, and I really didn't have a choice.",3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9UA3RJ1,3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9UA3RJ1
