I was in some sort of predicament. No one thought I was worthy being a newcomer. No one thought I could solve problems even though I was very capable. It took a while for people to notice how intelligent I was. I had to get help from a lot of my friends and even old professors. They were able to vouch for me, and show what I can do. After some time, after the help from friends and professors, I was promoted. The company was finally seeing me for who I truly am. It did take some time. However, I am glad that I am finally in the position where I belong. At this point in time, I am very successful and have had great times with this company. It was only a matter of time for them to realize my true potential. So here I am, living the best life. Making the money I have always dreamed to make, and empowering others to do the same.",,3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9V4MRJ9
