This is the most challenging obstacle for me in that situation. But, I tried myself with the help of my college professors and my friends. And I stood against all my seniors in that challenging obstacle. That was the first experience to face a problem in my work place and finally I came to an solution to solve such kind of problems. Although at the time, my company CEO call me upon for a meeting which is an important meeting to discuss about the new products and signing an agreement of a company. This becomes my greatest achievement because of my hard work from my own capability do anything that a fresher can! I proved this and hence I'm the very younger person came to attend this meeting. In life, a person has to learn that he/she must be ready to do anything that is difficult in today's society, also should know that no one will help them for anything that they know even it is very simple to solve. The world is full of jealous about other peoples what they are doing in their life. As I learnt was to struggle in the bad situations to achieve the things to be better than the worse. After this incident my seniors of the company appreciate for my effort without knowledge of them and achieved a great success in my life. This is my most memorable, sweetest memory that happened before 2 months. Also I will never forget this memory till the rest of my life. So, if we don't have a place to learn, we should make a place to learn. This is the good time by this task I can recall many things that helps me to be in greater success.",3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9V4MRJ9,3IX2EGZR7C5AK8GQJYSA3SF9V4MRJ9
