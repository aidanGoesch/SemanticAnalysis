This was very memorable because i took work off that day to help my sister that i love so much.  It was a very nice wedding and i was very happy to be apart of this wedding service. I felt as if was a very big brother to help her with this and to help set everything up for the wedding.  So many people came and told me that i did a very good job at picking out the flowers.  I felt very happy to have been apart of my sisters big day and i hope in the future she sees that i did a very nice thing to help her with her wedding.  Another thing that i felt very happy for was that so many family members came that i have not seen in many years.  It was very nice to catch up with old family. I felt very happy to have been apart of something so big.  The most memorable t hing about this was seeing my sister say i do.  She was so happy when she did her vows.  Everyone was watching and we had 109 people at the wedding. It was a very big wedding and so many people came.  The most surprising thing was when the ring boy fell when delivering the ring.  He was so cute though everyone smiled to not make him feel frightened .  It was a very good wedding.,,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMO056TQ
