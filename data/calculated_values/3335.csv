I have several health problems that I acquired in 2014 after some very stressful events at work. I've been dealing with these problems for about 5 years. I was aware that my claim would be denied because that is common so I will hire a lawyer. I work part time from home but there is no way I can work a regular full time job. I was working but I was in pain and I was exhausted after work. I ate a lot of convenience frozen food and I bought take out dinner on the way home because I was too tired to cook.  At night when I'm sleeping I wake up from arthritis pain. I also have pre-diabetes with hypoglycemia. In the morning I need to eat high protein food every hour or two to get my blood sugar up and stable then I'm usually ok for the rest of the day. I worked at a middle school and when kids bump into me in the hallway that hurt. If I'm on my feet a lot my body hurts. I walk slowly because of my arthritis pain and I was diagnosed with spinal spondylolisthesis of my lumbar 5 which is basically a slipped disc of the vertebrae.
