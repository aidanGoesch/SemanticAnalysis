We have travelled a lot of the country and would really love to retire to Hawaii. We have visited there many times and now that we do not have to stick to a schedule, it seems like the perfect time to find a permanent home there. We have friends that retired to the Big Island, but I think we would like Maui a lot better. It is very easy to get to all the different islands. I also know I would be able to see many of my friends that are still in the Army if they are coming through Oahu. My husband will be working for a little longer but he can work remotely. We have enough saved up in our travel fund that we can fly to Maui a few times to find a place to live. And whatever is leftover we can use toward our down payment. We are hoping to find something with a detached guest room area so that people can come and visit easily. It will also be really convenient to be closer to Asia so that we can do more traveling Being in the Army has offered a lot of opportunity and changes but I am very exciting to be able to be on my own schedule and devote more time to my personal hobbies. I am also excited to be able to grow more fruits and vegetables in a more tropical climate, and with more time to devote to the garden. It will be hard to say goodbye to the lifestyle that I known for so long, but so exciting for the next chapter in my life. I am glad to not have to use an alarm clock to wake up anymore! And I am so thankful that we have saved enough money to retire early and have the opportunities before us.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMWFR6TE
