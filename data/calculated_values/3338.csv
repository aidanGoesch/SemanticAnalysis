I get jokes about it all the time. It even has 279,000 miles on it! Some of my good friends even have a running bet on when it will finally die for good. I kept telling them they were foolish and it would live forever. Sadly, though, about two months ago it finally happened. I was driving on the highway back home from work when I heard a bad clunking from the engine. After some recent repairs by my husband I knew it was probably a transmission failure.  Not good. I had to call my husband at work and he came to pick me up to take me home. But instead of going back to our house, he pulled into the Hyundai dealer! He had already arranged a test drive for a brand new Santa Fe, the car we had been talking about recently as wanting to own. After a great test drive and some consultation, my husband walked back into the dealership and handed the salesman his credit card. I was blown away! I had no idea he was prepared to get me a new car, so this totally blew me away! From one bad car to a great new car in one day!",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMXLX6TX
