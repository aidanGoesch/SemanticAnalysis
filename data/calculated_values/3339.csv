We've been talking for over a year about getting a new car, he knew I wanted another Hyundai and this time I wanted a crossover. He even got red, my favorite color. The interior is beige fabric, I like fabric seats rather than leather, it has a backup camera, a great sound system, and I am able to connect my phone with bluetooth. The first thing I did was to connect my phone and drive up the road and call my husband using the buttons on the steering wheel.   I've never had a brand new car so this is so exciting for me. It is going to take a little while to get used to such a big vehicle, and use the back up camera but I already love this car and feel that its comfortable to drive. It has everything that I want without overdoing the extras. I'm so happy. It will also be great for when my daughter comes to visit, it has a lot more room for her 2 boys, and it will be much easier getting them in and out, and plenty of space for all of the extra that you need when traveling with little ones.  I no longer have to worry about space when I go grocery shopping and its not so big that my mother cannot get in and out when I pick her up. I know how Mark is and I'm sure he cannot wait to go over every little thing in the manual. I hope he doesn't start tearing into the engine, I'll have to remind him that it's a new car and he doesn't have to rebuild it. Well its starting to look like the Huyndai is now our brand, it's our third one and Kevin recently bought a new Huyndai as well. I can't wait for tomorrow, we're going on a little road trip to give it a good work out and see how she runs.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMXLX6TX
