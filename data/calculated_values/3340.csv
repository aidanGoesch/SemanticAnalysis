I always thought that it would be some good looking investment banker that recently realized that he loved men and not women.  I know that feeling of being confused with my sexuality.  I spent my whole childhood wondering if anyone else had these feelings.  I thought that this man would be new to my life and I would love him more than anything I had ever known, but the truth is that this man was in my life since I was born. My father did not take my coming out very well.  He was confused and that confusion turned into anger.  My father wanted to know how I could do something like this that would embarrass the family.  He was caught up in what I had to deal with my whole childhood, which was wondering how my life decisions would effect everyone else. Since my fathers blow up, I have been talking to my mother in order to try and not lose any relationship we ever had.  My mother has been wonderful throughout this process and believes that who I want to spend my life with, has no barring on who I am as a person.  She has helped my father see the light and I am forever in her debt. Two weeks ago I got a phone call from someone who I was not sure that I would ever speak with again.  It was my father.  He wanted to come by my house and talk.  He wanted to let me know that no matter what I did in life, he would always love me and support me.  He apologized for the way he initially handled everything. I finally met the best man in the world.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMY6F6TM
