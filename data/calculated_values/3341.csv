Since the holidays I've been thinking about it a lot. I am so grateful for how he reacted as I expected it to go so much worse. Coming from such a religious family, I expected them to reject me for being gay. It was so hard going to Catholic school and keeping a secret for so long. I knew the kids in my class wouldn't accept me. I thought my family would feel the same way. Turns out I was wrong, because dad already knew. When I came out to him, he said he suspected as much and was just waiting for me to say so. He asked if I was sure, and of course I was. And then he just said ""ok"". I think he wishes I was straight, but he wants me to be happy. I think my brother isn't totally accepting of this yet, but he's not being as bad about it as I thought he would. Maybe dad said something to him. It's helping me a lot to think about how my family has accepted me for who I am, when I meet people who don't act like I want them to. I try to be understanding and accept them the way they are. I'm working on it anyway.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMY6F6TM
