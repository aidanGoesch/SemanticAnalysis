A few months ago,  i was having a deep talk with my father. My father was a very tough  person, very strict and religious i would say, and for that i was afraid of him. We are not that close ,i was more closed to my mother . I was quite feminine and no girlfriend yet.     I am pretty nervous because the topic might go towards my sexuality and it does . My father asked me ,do you have a girlfriend? I said no i don't have,  are you gay, i don't know what to say at this point i was very nervous. I just said if I said no are you going to believe or if I said yes are you going to accept me?  My father said ever since you are a child i knew it , i just don't have the courage to asked. and i accept you regardless because you are my son and i love you. I was in tears  and overwhelmed with happiness because i am finally free of myself of always being afraid to be found out by others. Constant thinking of other people might say or thinking it hurts me so much and my well being, it was not healthy for me.      Whenever i was thinking of that moment i was very happy for myself and my family . God i love my family they mean the world to me, I don't know what to do without them. My coming out story is very important that i will never forget.  I hope i might inspire others to be themselves and other might accept them for who are they really are. Thank you.",3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMY6F6TM,
