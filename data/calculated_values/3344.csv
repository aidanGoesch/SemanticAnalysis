It is a time to catch up with everyone and it makes you feel like no time has passed and you are back in with everyone. I love seeing everyone.  It lets you get out of the day to day grind and just enjoy everything for a while. There are people like myself that have moved away so when we get together  it always brings us closer together again. I like that because I get to go home back to New York and see everything I grew up with. Being in Florida is much different so I am glad that we have these get togethers.  Plus  I have time away from my kids and get to be with other adults. Being with old friends bring old memories back and lets you live in the easy going times of your life. I think that everyone should experience that. Because everyone should be able to go back to their happy place. Who wouldn't want to go back to their youth? Who wouldn't want to be carefree if just for a little while?  I love to go back home even for a day or two just to see how the area is. I know others love to do that too. It is so fun to do.,,3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW2BX09BA
