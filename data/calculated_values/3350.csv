It was held in a hotel that we were able to get rooms in.  The party would take place downstairs in the conference room.  We had spent quite some time getting ready for the costume themed party and took some pictures.  When we got downstairs, we were surprised by how crowded it was.  They had a black light and other disco lights going and the music was loud.  We chose a table in the middle and as soon as we sat down, we had another couple approach us.  This was our first couple since the big blowup earlier in our swinging history.   The other couple seemed very nice and clean cut and both members were attractive.  We thought we were getting along well, but we had to run to our room for a minute to freshen up and when we came back out and was waiting for the elevator, we saw the woman who we were speaking to rushing out with her luggage and crying.  This was right after we were all at the table together talking well so we were surprised when she would not get on the elevator with us or speak to us.  We thought to ourselves, uh oh, they can't handle our sauce!  One of our biggest issues was finding couples that were on the same page in their relationship but obviously this was not it!  She apparently had some unresolved jealousy going on that she was not honest about.  The husband seemed oblivious to all this so we concluded that he had talked her into going.  I do not think that she was fully involved in that decision and was just going along to please her husband.",3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H1VP60H,
