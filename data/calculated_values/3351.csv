We had already explored options such as toys, role play, and locations.  We wanted to revisit the subject of swinging since we had enjoyed it so much previously.  The reason we stopped it in the past was due to a huge fight we had one night with a couple we were swinging with.  It almost escalated to police being called and their were some punches being thrown.  It was very emotional and I thought our marriage  was broken after that night.  It took a lot of work, but we got back on track and stopped swinging.  We had been happy for several years without swinging, but did miss it.  We recently decided due to our emotional maturity that we wanted to get back into the swinging lifestyle.  We booked ourselves  for the next party on a swinging site we are a member of and hoped it would go well and be a much better experience than when we left before.    We got to the hotel that was hosting the party and got ourselves checked in and started to get ready in our hotel room by dressing up in our costumes.  The party had a theme so we had purchased outfits accordingly.  We were finally ready and went down to the party.  We walked in and was very nervous that it would end like last time.  This visit was a whole new vibe though.  Everyone was very friendly and we were like social butterflies talking to all the other couples.  By the time the party was over, we felt like it could go on all night as we were having such a grand time.  We left this party with smiles on our face and satisfaction in our heart.  We enjoyed it so much we have decided to go to every party they host (they have one once a month).",3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H1VP60H,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H1VP60H
