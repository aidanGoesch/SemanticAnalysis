When I am doing nothing I look for any way to distract myself. I played League of Legends to be able to distract me. I felt that it was a way out of my problems and to be able to arise again. I had many economic and social problems, my family asked me to earn extra income and look for the form. My wife always told me to find a way to distract myself and get out of the monotony. When I was accepted by Amazon Mechanical Turk I felt a happy person. I felt that now if I could get distracted and doing these surveys online I found out many things. I earn extra money as my family asked me and I can also get distracted as my wife advised me. It is a way to have fun to see it from another point of view. I feel a new person. I feel that my mood changed. My custom, many things. I thank the company for giving me the opportunity to participate in these paid surveys. Thank you!",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9HBRI60C
