The first thing I did was being able to work online and get paid on Amazon Mechanical Turk . Which is hard to get approved. But once I did I started working hard till this day. It was a big step for me because I have extreme Anxiety and health problems. Which is very difficult to get a job. Being able to earn money has had a large impact on my daily life. Ive been able to finally pay my share and help out my parents. They gave me a lot of support financially and emotional. It felt really good to be able to helped  them out. I  The second step I took was finally open a bank account. Which was important because without it I wouldn't be able to transfer money  I earned from Amazon Mechanical Turk. It was really difficult for me because I get really bad panic attacks. I have to listen to relaxing music to calm my nerves like of monsters and men whenever I am in a vehicle. But I managed to get it done without a sever panic attack. With those two steps I took I might be able to finally overcome my anxiety and start living a normal life.,,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9HBRI60C
