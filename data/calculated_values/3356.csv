Today is Maria's first day of Kindergarten! Being that Maria is our eldest child, she is the first one to go to Kindergarten.  Last night I told her we needed to prepare, and she was so excited! I had her go into her closet and pick out her favorite outfit. Maria picked out a pink t-shirt that says ""I <3 MERMAIDS"" with a pretty picture of a mermaid on the front, a pair of  jeans, and pink socks.  So last night I helped her pack her backpack with the school supplies we just bought.  Of course, all the items that could be pink in color were pink! Upon completion of packing her backpack, I told her she had to start getting up early, so plenty of sleep is a must. This morning I didn't even have to wake her up, as her alarm went off and she hopped out of bed super excited for the big day. I went into her room and found she had dressed herself, and was just finishing putting on her shoes. ""Mom, today is my first day... i can't wait to make new friends!"" she said as we hurried into the car. We arrived a few minutes early so that I could help her find her classroom and her teacher. Mrs. Andrews was her name, and she greeted us with a huge smile and gave Maria a hug! Maria danced right into the classroom and found her seat at her new desk. I was so happy that she wasn't scared or nervous. She fit right in, and started talking to her classmates. I left and went home. Finally it was 2pm, and I raced to the school to pick her up. She came running up to my car with the biggest smile on her face. ""Mom! You're not going to believe how many new friends I have! I love this school!"" she exclaimed as I buckled her into her car seat. Today was a very good day!",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9HBSK06A
