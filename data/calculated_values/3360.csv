It seems like ages since I've been able to write anything but it's only been a few short months since the surgery to remove my spleen. Through it all I have the love of my life, my darling Charlene, to thank for her care and understanding. If you've never experienced what I have you probably won't understand but she was there when it happened, she was the one who insisted that I go to the hospital and it was her who cared enough to stay by my side night after night when things took a turn for the worse. It wasn't the surgery that laid me up but the complications caused by a negligent hospital staff and it was Charlene who rode their tails and saw to it that I received the follow up care I needed when things went side ways. So there I was, sitting on the sofa with my girl. We watching a movie on Netflix. I felt a stabbing pain in my back. Then I blacked out but it felt like I had just nodded off for a second. I woke up when Charlene started shaking me. She was upset. She knew before I did that things weren't right and before I could stop her she was already on the phone talking to my doctor. Next thing I know I'm in an ambulance racing through traffic with sirens blasting and lights flashing. They took me straight into the operating room and I woke up a few hours later with a 9 inch incision on my side where my spleen should have been. The first sign that something wasn't right was when I started trembling. I thought it was just a  chill but Charlene knew better. Turns out she knew better than all the nurses and doctors because what mhad been written off as a minor infection turned out to be meningitis without Charlene's insisting on the hospital doing further tests I wouldn't be here today. Thank you Charlene. I love, love, love you!!",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZC1G2WQL
