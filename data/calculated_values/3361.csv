My girlfriend was in Miami, planning to visit me for our birthdays. Needless to say, when she arrived, our plans were all cancelled. I tried my best to continue on with our travel plans but the pain was horrible. We ended up at the ER after a week of her visiting. I was admitted immediately into the hospital. I was losing feeling in my right foot. The doctors in ER were concerned and scheduled emergency back surgery for the next morning.  My girl didn't skip a beat. She left the hospital and went back to take care of my dogs. The next day she was back and stayed by my side until I was released. I wasn't able to lift or walk much. She offered to stay on in AZ for an additional three weeks to help me with bathing, walking, cooking, basically everything I'd need during my recovery. I couldn't drive so she has to do shopping and take the dogs out on their daily walks. I don't know how I would have survived this time without her by my side. She really showed me what true love and friendship is all about. She didn't ask for anything in return. She was supportive in every way imaginable and I saw what a genuine, wonderful woman she is. Before she returned to FL, we decided we'd get an apartment and she would come back to help even more. I found a place 2 blocks from my office. This helped  with my recovery and instead of driving 2 hours every day, I now drive 2 minutes one way. We've been living together since April and although it's been a real roller coaster, I couldn't be happier to share my home and life with this person. She is the epitome of real and love. I can't say enough about her and what brightness and joy she has brought to my life. She's a stellar example of being an amazing human.",3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZC1G2WQL,
