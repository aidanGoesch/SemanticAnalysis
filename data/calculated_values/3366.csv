I haven't talked to him in a little while. In doing so I came to find out that we was renovating the house next door. Turns out he was asked to gut the house and pull out all the walls. I had told him that I was in the process of re-doing my kitchen. In the kitchen of the house he was renovating was a newer style stove. It was considerably better than the original stove that was in my house and he offered for me to have it. I was very thankful and appreciative of him letting me have it. The timing of the event couldn't have been better. I gave him some advice on some projects he was thinking of doing at his house. When I completed my project I invited them over to come see how it turned out. I also showed him the new stove and thanked him again. It has been a nice addition to my house. When I see it I am glad. It saved me a good amount of money and looks very nice.,,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCZCWQ8
