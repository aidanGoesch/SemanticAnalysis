We went to Alaska in 2019. It was the month of May. We rode on a plane for the first time to get there. It was a little scary but we managed not to faint. The cruise was very fun. I remember eating a lot of lobster and steak on most nights. I would always go to the casino to gamble. I had a fun time in there. I won and lost a bunch but overall I did alright. There were dance nights that were fun. I would dance with other drunk people. I didn't puke but some people did. I went down a slide on one day. It was fun. I also golfed on the ship. One of the balls went overboard.,,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSGSUI
