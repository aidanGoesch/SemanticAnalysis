I'm hurt. I'm angry. I need him. I love him. I'm mad at him. I'm feeling all kinds of different ways. He doesn't want to commit to me. I feel that this is not good for me. I gave him my all. He trashed me. He thinks he can get what he wants then not do the hard work of commitment. I hope that he soon sees how life is without this ""cow"". I want him back so bad. I cannot live this way without him but I will if I have to. Eventually I will get over this and realize he was not good for me. If I'm any good a man will want me for who I am and not what I can give to him.",,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N95K9XP7
