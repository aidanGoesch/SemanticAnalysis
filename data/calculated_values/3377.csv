Well, I finally got my chance to do so about four weeks ago. Unfortunately I greatly underestimated how much work would be involved. Before I did it I thought, ""Oh it's just weaving, how hard could it be?"" Pretty hard, it turns out. I went down to a local school here and managed to take lessons there, which lasted for a few weeks. During those lessons I was able to get some exposure to various types of weaving materials, which was nice. After a while I finally decided on attempting to create my own scarf. They're shaped very simply and don't involve too many types of fabric, so I figured that was a good starting point for projects. Overall the process wasn't too bad, but that yarn I used sure was a pain in the ass to work with. It was really thick and stiff, and kind of difficult to get into the right patterns for weaving. I kept at it and that perseverance and endurance carried me to the finish line, so to speak. Around the time that I finished the scarf there was a state fair taking place, so I decided to enter the scarf into a competition just for fun. There were some incredibly talented people in the contest, so my competition was pretty tough. In the end, though, I placed 4th and even got a cute ribbon! Who knows, maybe next year I'll do even better.",,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N9XEXXPB
