I received many compliments and it really felt good, especially after all the hard work I had put into it. I actually took quite a bit of time finishing the scarf as I did weaving it. I even looked through books for a different way to do the ends, i did not want fringe on the ends. So, I found an old book and found a very interesting way of tying knots to finish the ends. There was a comment on the paper that came with my ribbon, strengths and weaknesses of my project. They were not enthuisatic about my ends, but I am fine with the way I choose. It is extremely different and was difficult to learn, which increased my self esteem and was more encouraging. I often look at my scarf and know I have a lot of potential and talent in me for weaving. I'ts interesting to think about why it took decades for me to intersect with a way to learn how to weave, when I had been wanting to for decades. Of course the internet did not exist in the 1970's. I am not a big fan of all this high tech in life. But I will say the internet is a blessing for every person on this planet that has access. No matter where you are, you can type something you want to learn about, and up it pops. People from all over the globe have uploaded their skills and instructions for doing everything! It's absolutely amazing.",3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N9XEXXPB,
