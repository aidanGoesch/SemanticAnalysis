I had always wanted to weave. I had wanted to weave for the past 30 years. But I had no idea where to go. Or who to call about learning. I knew no one who wove. So I finally found a business online that gave lessons. It was about 30 minutes from my home. I signed up. I went once a week and the instructor was great.  I like unusual yarns and picked some that were very difficult to weave with. But I did not know, because i had never woven before.  I worked many hours at that place on my weaving. I finally finished several months ago. I then decided to enter it into the state fair. They have ribbons for weaving of different types. I entered in the scarf category. I had no idea what other peoples entries would look like, as I had never looked at weaving before. I was delighted when I went to the fair after it had opened and found a ribbon hanging from my scarf! I had won 4th place, for the very first thing I had ever wove. The other entries were very professional looking, in fact a lot of them were entered by the same people over and over, so I feel good about winning a ribbon.",3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N9XEXXPB,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N9XEXXPB
