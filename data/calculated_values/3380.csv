I am in pain and uncomfortable but HAVE to get better soon. The sooner I heal and recover from this injury the sooner I can get back to doing the things I enjoy with my lovely wife. I WILL overcome this and once again get back to enjoying the things i once took for granted. I will work hard and make sure to do my part to participate in my recovery so I can get back to MY LIFE. I with my wife's support will achieve my goal in getting better. This hip injury that I obtained after being careless will not take from me. i will not allow it to. i know as important as it is for myself to recover it is important for my family as well. I will make sure to pay more attention when i am on the go. I will also make sure that i look down more often when walking so that I will not trip over anything of have any more unexpected falls. I will care for my body more. I will appreciate my functional abilities of my body more from now on. i will overcome this. I will be a victor in this journey of healing.,,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS74Q09LY
