I can not carry-on working with my bad hip.   Can no longer carry out my duties at work .  which leaves me no choice but to quit and work from home hopefully.  I am so upset that I cannot get around like I used to. I am a creature of habit and this will make me change so many  things in my life.  I am not sure I can come back from this situation . I will have to try and get myself back in shape so I can at least take Sheryl out on the weekends to shop and do weekend get togethers.  I can't sleep at night thinking about it.  I have never been so depressed and lonely in my life. Things' must get better or I will go crazy. I must get better.  I must find some other kind of work.  I must do the work from home. I hope my wife will still love me. Life is a crape shoot. You never know what is going to happen.,,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS74Q09LY
