It was so  bad he almost lost his life. He was admitted in the hospital for ten days. I was so worried about him and visited him every day. I was really worried about my brother and his wife too because it has to be so hard to watch a child go through something like that. I am glad he was discharged and has now made a full recovery. I really worry that nothing ever happens like that again. Makes me think about my son and the kind of things I won't be able to protect him. The accident my nephew was involved in wasn't his fault and there was no way for him to prevent it. It just makes you think about how unpredictable life really is. There are so many things in life that you just can not control. Some times it is hard to find hope that my son will be able to be lucky enough to avoid such circumstances as my nephew. I think it does help to know that my nephew is fine because it gives me a little hope that things will be okay even if my son gets into some unexpected accident. I still check in on my nephew every week or so just so he knows I am thinking about him. I think this really showed him how much he is loved.,,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7KKGL9U
