This is one of the tasks that a parent may fail and the kids can hate you forever. I took Junior to school at an earlier age as parent. All i had in mind was to make my a responsible mom and make his good life. The efforts of my past came to conclusion like two months ago. After Junior being in school for 16 years , he finally completed his first degree. This was a day for me to remember since every body was eager for it. I woke up as normal and prepared everything in the house as normal and waited for the rest of the family to wake up. Junior was the first one and he went all the house reminding everybody what it was. We left the house for Harvard where the graduation will take place and everybody was happy about it. At school he introduced as to most of his friend he has pushed with. surprisingly he introduced his girlfriend. everything in school was going as planned. The ceremony took off well i was impressed by the fact that he topped everything in his class. We were all happy to see him receive the first class honors. We all arranged an after party which was well spent.",3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7KKGL9U,
