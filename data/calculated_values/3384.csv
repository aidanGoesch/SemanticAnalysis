I took the next flight back home . I was very scared and did ot know what to expect once I got home. The caller did not give me any essential details that I needed. He just said I need to be home as my nephew i was living with was sick and ha been taken to hospital. When I got home, I got directions to the hospital. I rushed there . I found a friendly staff who led me to the room my nephew was in. I found him lying in bed unconscious with bandages all over his face. pipes were connected to o his nose. I was a bag of nerves   I sat there calling his name holding his hand. I praid to God to make him at least open his eyes. After a few minutes, He opened his eyes and looked at me. I was very happy. He spoke to me. He told me how he was involved in a road accident but does not remember much. Thank God he later recovered and we went home ten days later.",3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7KKGL9U,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7KKGL9U
