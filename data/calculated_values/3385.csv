I have been looking for work for the last couple of months and I found an opening at this really amazing company. I put in the application and everything but I was so sure it wasn't going to work out because it was just the best job I could ever dream of. Well to my amazement a few days after applying they actually called me for an interview! The position was basically my dream position, something I couldn't imagine being able to do so early in my career. I prepared for the interview really carefully, and got everything I needed together. I even had my family members sit through mock interviews with me so that I could practice. I was still thinking ""this is a long shot"", but I had the slightest bit of hope that it might really work out. So I got all ready the day of the interview and I was all hyped up. I get to the interview and it's all going well, but when we are finishing up and I am supposed to turn over my credentials I realized I had forgotten them at home! I was so mortified! I mean, of course they told me that it was fine and I could just send them over via email later, but I think it made me look like a flake. I doubt they'll want to hire me now! There were probably plenty of good applicants who didn't forget anything. I just feel so nervous and upset about it. I am hoping for a second chance, but at this point it's not looking good.",,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7NRE9LX
