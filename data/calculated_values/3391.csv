Me and new wife have been together about 4 years.  We moved to a new city to be closer to her family.  The wedding was planned in about 4 months which is pretty quick.  We saved as much as we could and her parents were gracious enough to pay the rest of it off for us.  We sent out the invites to many people and we had about 125 attend the wedding.  Even at this number it was pretty expensive.  We found our officiant which was a close friend of the family.  Our ring bearers were also close friends of the family.  Our flower girls were my nieces.  They looked so pretty all dressed up.  On the day of the wedding I was very nervous.  I could not wait to marry this beautiful woman and make her my wife.  My stomach was in knots.  When I first saw her tears came to my eyes and I was crying she looked amazing.  At the reception We got pretty drunk and had a great time dancing and enjoying everyone's company.  Right after the wedding we went on our honeymoon to Cabo.  We had fun there as well and really got to relax and enjoy life.  We got to go swimming we went on a tour to see old Mayan ruins and temples.  We also went parasailing and rode horses.  When we finally got back we had to go back to the grind which really sucked.,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7SDZL97,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7SDZL97
