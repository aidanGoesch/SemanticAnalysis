Had made sure to leave food for the animals back at home being that we would be gone for a while. we also went with friends and family. Few hours later we were on the road on our way. It didn't take that long to get there maybe about 2 hours. we spent most of our time hanging out on the white sandy beaches. building sand castles and riding the waves in the water. it was fun indeed while it lasted. I also got to meet up with an old marine corps friend of mine that I haven't seen in a long time. we talked about a lot of our old experiences. Overall I'm glad me and the family and friends were able to have vacation together.",,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7UU0L98
