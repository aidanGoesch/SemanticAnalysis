This was a private charter fishing experience so we had a captain and one of crew member on the boat and then it was just my son and I. This was an extremely memorable experience as this was my first time ever going on a fishing charter. My son really wanted to catch sharks so they took us black tip shark fishing. We ended up catching 6 with the biggest being one my son caught. It was such a fun bonding experience with my son and it's something I will never forget. I think about this fishing trip quite often. My son, who is only 5, still talks about this fishing trip. He has even written about it in his school work. He loves telling all of our friends and family about the big four foot black tip shark he had caught. Luckily, we were able to capture this memory by taking lots of pictures. We even had a picture of my son and me holding the shark that we've since gotten framed in his bedroom. I get such joy thinking about this event. One day, I'd hope my son gets to take his children on a fishing trip like this. I am truly blessed to have experienced this.",3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7UU0L98,
