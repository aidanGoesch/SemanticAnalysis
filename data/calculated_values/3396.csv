It is an unconventional job. I am trying to become a customer auditor. I have got my first certification. I have successfully done several jobs. I have learned about $200. I am hoping that I can convince my husband to also do this job. We could really use the extra money. I am tired of my family being on a constant budget. I know my husband hates his job. I know he would like anyting better than his current job. I am on disability. I do not walk well. Mentally however I am just fine. I know I can do more. Being employed and earning an income is important to my self-worth. I do understand that there is value to time versus money. Sometimes I choose money sometimes time.,,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7UV2L9C
