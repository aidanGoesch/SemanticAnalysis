I was at a dinner gathering at a friend's house, and was ready to call it a night. It was a Friday night and the week had been a long one at work. I was more than looking forward to hitting the sack at this point. I got in my car and hit the road. Nothing seemed eerie, out of the ordinary, or anything of the sort which would indicate that danger laid ahead. The roads were slick as there has just been rain fall in the lower region of town I was in. This was, of course, expected. As I began to gain elevation on a road that led through a mountain pass towards my destination, I noticed that there was a gentle snowfall that immediately disappeared on the ground as it melted. As I realized this, I did some mental calculations and concluded that this would make the road as slippery as ever with ice patches scattered throughout. As I was driving, looking out for potential danger, I came through turn around a blind curve. As I cleared the turn, I noticed some debris from a rock slide and swerved to try to avoid it. As I did this, my car veered off of the road and hit the side of the mountain, disabling it beyond operation and repair. I called for help and the police showed up. The grandfatherly officer that was on the scene made sure that I was okay. I was. He did a thorough walk-through of the scene. As he did this, he took thorough notes that were almost mathematical in nature. As he wrapped up the report that he had been compiling, he came up to me and said... ""You know son, you are lucky. Just last Friday someone had an carbon copy of the accident you just had. The only difference is that instead of coming to the abrupt stop into the mountain like you did... he and his car ricocheted off of the side the of mountain, slid across road, and tumbled down the cliff side just right there."" He pointed what seemed like a dark abyss down below. ""He did not make it."", he said. Suddenly, I was struck with a different perspective about life that has made me different in a good way since.",,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7VWD9LE
