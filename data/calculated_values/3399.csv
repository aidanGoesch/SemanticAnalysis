I picked her up around 9am so we could start our day having a fun breakfast at one of our favorite places to eat breakfast. Pine State Biscuit! We decided to throw all things ""diet"" out the door and partake in the most delicious and tasty waffles known to man. We had extra whip cream with a large amount of blueberries. Once we relaxed into our lovely surroundings we chatted for about an hour. We got caught up and re-connected, which was just what I was hoping for. We left with big smiles and satiated appetites. It was a gorgeous day outside. Blue sky, no clouds, slight breeze. So we then decided to take a walk. We thought this might help us digest our enormous intake of food. We found ourselves standing next to a regal movie theater. We looked at each other and just started laughing.  She, afterall, wants to be an actress. Well we just had to go inside to see what was playing.  It made complete sense that after that long walk we had to reward ourselves. In search of the latest and greatest movie we marched inside to investigate this funky little theater. We found exactly the movie we wanted, made our purchase and settled in. Some teenagers were making a tremendous amount of noise and my niece turned around and said: ""leave the theater if you plan to keep that up. Some of us actually are here to watch the movie and we'd like to listen"". She was so direct yet kind -I was so proud of her. They stopped talking immediately. Afterwards, food now settled nicely, it was time to head out to our favorite rink and roller skate. We skated until we felt like our legs could no longer move and ended our evening exhausted and promptly fell asleep.",,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7VZ19L8
