It starts like most, I met a girl, I fell in love, everything seemed like happiness, sunshine, and rainbows. It was all perfect for a time. That is, until she got pregnant. Things took a dark turn when she got pregnant. I know that hormones can get pretty crazy, but let me tell you, crazy was a complete understatement. I was no saint. I knew nothing of how to deal with mood swings and hormonal imbalances. I would yell, get angry, and overall most of the time just make the situation worse. I never knew how to act almost. I did my best but my very best just wasn't good enough. She would yell constantly. And so would I. Fights were back and forth screaming matches. It got slightly better after the baby was born. I was finally a dad. We were finally a family together. Her and I split up a few months after the baby was born. It turned out that not everything was perfect sunshine and rainbows. I am still in my child's life, but I long for that family dynamic ever so much.",,3JBT3HLQF9OF8A5FOSR7MR3KCGGZP6
