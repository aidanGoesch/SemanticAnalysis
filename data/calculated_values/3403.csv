Everyday it gets better other times it is just hard to get out of bed or concentrate from what occurred 2 years ago. You see 2 years ago my child was born, my first born daughter but lets not get ahead of ourselves. For weeks leading up to the joyous event I would do what i always do. I would have lunch with my parents and we would just enjoy each others company. When i first told them my wife was pregnant everyone was so happy. That quickly turned into a battle of who is going to receive more from them vs my brother. You see my brother and his wife were preganant aswell and yes we are estranged, thats a different story in it itself. My parents started acting weirder and weirder as the time approached. What started as little babysitting visits soon turned into I cant wait to take her on vacation with me to then, when i raise your child. I knew i had to put a stop to it so i told them i was the parent and what i say goes. AT first the seemed to understand and even say, Oh i know im just saying. but on the day of taking my wife to the hospital. My mother made an unannounced entrance in our house and went to knock on the bathroom door where my wife was taking a shower. My wife thought it was her mom knocking on the door since she was staying over with us due to the delivery date (she lives abroad) and my wife said what do you want to which my mom just leaves. When my child was born my mom called and said she was coming over to see the baby. Everyone was there enjoying the company of this new child, my dad for watever reason refused to hold the baby. but whatever it is what it is. The next day my mom said she was coming over again and i said ok. after a few hours while she was there i politily told her it was time to go since we were sleepy and tired and again she left said nothing. ON the day of coming to our house finally, all my family were there to greet the new baby cousins and all. she left saying how the house was to crowded. the following day she majes a huge scandel how i did not let my dad hold the baby and how i was being rude and cold hearted and that i was a horrible son for dening then their raising rights. They twisted the story to everyone else in my family and now i am shinned from everyone else event though its all lies. I even tried explaining to them multiple times and in different ways but they dont believe me. I tried to reason with her to no avail, i still suffer from this everyday and hope i can move on someday",,3JBT3HLQF9OF8A5FOSR7MR3KCGGZP6
