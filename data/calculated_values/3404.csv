However, two weeks ago, I was blessed a whole week vacation to spend time with my family. I suggested we should go to the apple orchard that is half an hour away from us, and they all thought it was a great idea. I took them out to the apple orchard and it was a magnificent sight to look at. There was a bunch of bright, red apples everywhere and my kids were so excited that they ran with all their might to go touch the perfect red apples that not even Wholefoods may have. My kids saw a tall apple orchard in the distance and excitedly wanted me to grab the highest apple from the tree. Of course, I was reluctant about it because it was so high I can take a rocket ship.  My wife motivated me even further saying she would make lasagna this week, and that was all the encouragement I needed... apart from my kids of course. I took the ladder and positioned it at the tree. I looked up and I saw an apple calling for my attention. I knew right then and there that was the apple I needed in my life. I plucked it from the stem, but it took a great force to pluck it and the ladder wobbled. Had it not been my family, I would have fallen! Forget Marvel, my superheroes were my family that day. My family saw the apple and thought it was probably the apple that Snow White ate. We got so many apples. We were able to fill two buckets! After we plucked and sang, we did many other fun things. We played hide and seek in the orchard and that was fun because there were so many hiding spots to choose from! We may have accidentally squashed some apples as we ran but I apologized for it. It was a vacation we all needed. The business there allowed us to bake an apple pie from the apples we got, and I thought that was so amazing from their part; and we baked the most beautiful, delicious Apple pie that not even Gordon Ramsey can compete with. I'm content that I was able to spend a beautiful time with them.",,3JBT3HLQF9OF8A5FOSR7MR3KF95PZA
