I can't believe my long time friend is finally getting married. It has been a long time coming. I'm proud to have been there. It was a fantastic wedding. I even got to play cello for her wedding. I mean I'm not that great at playing the cello, but I played my heart out for her because she's my best friend. We had a lot of fun at her wedding, and we took many pictures. I will cherish this memory forever. The wedding was just great! When it's my turn to speak up the wedding, I went up the podium and spoke about how great a person my friend is. I also talked about how we first met, and at first we hated each other. But over time we actually became best friends! How weird is that, huh? Too weird!",,3JC6VJ2SAC5AESFOSL2U7S7UC5GA5M
