I first began my journey by flying to the airport to NYC. Then we got stuck in a lot of traffic at La Guardia Airport. It was truly a nightmare. It made me certainly realize that I will never fly out of this airport again. Next we drove to Long island and met the soon to be bride. She looked so stunning and I was so proud to be her friend. The wedding was phenomenal. I played cello at her ceremony and it was a perfect summer day in New York. The food was amazing. She had spent around $250 per person on food and it was nothing short of spectacular. I had Seafood, Salad, Filet Mignon, Duck, Salmon and eight kinds of desserts. After the wedding, we had a lot of dancing. It was a traditional Jewish Wedding and it was so energetic. It was so much fun. The next day we took a train ride into the City and had some yummy Pizza and bagels. I will cherish this special moment forever.",,3JC6VJ2SAC5AESFOSL2U7S7UC5GA5M
