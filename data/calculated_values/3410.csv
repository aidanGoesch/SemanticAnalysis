This is exciting because we have been working on saying yes and no and understanding what these things mean. I asked her if she wanted some avocado. She usually loves to eat avocado. I expected a simple nod yes. Instead she goes, ""no thank you."" She has said yes and no and thank you separately already. However, she has yet to put it all together. We have prompted her a lot, guiding her to this. She finally understood and verbalized! I called Aaron over in hopes she would say it again and he could hear. It's important for us as parents that she is able to verbally exercise consent and has an understanding of it from a young age. Raising a girl and being a woman myself, I am very aware of the risks she faces growing up in a society that views women as objects and does not necessarily respect us when we say no. I figure the earlier she learns her voice and that she has choices in things, the more likely she is to speak up for herself in a variety of ways. I know this may turn into her telling me, ""no"" to things a lot, but I welcome the conflict. I'm excited to see how she continues to develop!",,3JC6VJ2SAC5AESFOSL2U7S7UOOL5A0
