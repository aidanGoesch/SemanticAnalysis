It all started on a Tuesday night. I was leaving work and the rain was coming down hard. I usually don't worry a lot about a little rain. However, while I had been working and not following the weather, there had been a lot of rain apparently. I ran from the building to my car, focusing on getting to the vehicle without getting my laptop wet and not really taking notice of the torrents of water pooling throughout the parking lot. I did notice that my shoes and clothes were soaked once I had reached the car. So, I drove from the lot and headed to my home that's just several miles away. I recall now driving through standing water on the road and shrugging it off as drainage issues. When I was close to home, I knew by this time that this rain was different. It was raining hard and not letting up. I couldn't see very well through the rain falling on the windshield. I contemplated pulling over but I was already so close to home. As I prepared to drive over a little bridge overpass, I felt my car being rocked a little. The car struggled for traction and I found myself being pulled off of the road by the rain runoff. I did the only thing I could think of, I exited my car and held onto a nearby tree. I watched as my vehicle and all my possessions inside it were swept over the bridge into the creek bed below. I waited in stunned silence until another driver spotted me and I climbed into their vehicle. I still can't believe this happened to me. I just feel lucky to be alive after something like that happening. I now am much more careful about driving in the rain and warn others to do the same.",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RK3EMVEK
