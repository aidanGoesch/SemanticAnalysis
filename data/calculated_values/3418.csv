It was a harrowing experience that was very emotional. I think I'll always remember it. I recall waking up to notifications on my phone regarding flash floods in the area, but I was mostly dismissive. Who gets caught in a flood, anyhow!? I showered and dressed in preparation for work and headed out the door. It was raining like crazy and I guess it had been for 15-20 minutes at that point. Still, I needed to get to work, so I ran for the car and jumped in. I started driving down my road when I noticed that there was some standing water on the road. I had a small car, but figured I could handle the road easily. Then, seemingly out of nowhere, a wave of water hit my car on the left side, sending it skidding to the sidewalk. The water was up past the doors and rushing into the car.  I panicked and opened the door as quickly as I could to exit the vehicle. I tried to push the car out of the now-river, but couldn't manage it. I knew the car was totaled and was distraught, when I noticed that the engine was smoking. I reentered the car to turn the engine off and then stood there and cried. I ruined the car, along with my laptop which was still inside. I couldn't stop thinking about how I would have reacted if my infant son were in the car with me. I am grateful that he wasn't and that, despite insurance headaches, everything turned out ok.",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RK3EMVEK
