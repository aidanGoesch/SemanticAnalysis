I hadn't been on a vacation in years, so I was very excited. I also had never been to Tennessee before, and I knew they had a lot of attractions and good food to look forward to. I went with my family, my sister's family, and my parents. We decided to rent a huge RV and went on a road trip. That made it so much more fun. One of my favorite places we went was DollyWood. The only other amusement park I had been to before was Hershey Park. DW was so much fun. I must have spent 100 dollars just on food. We took the kids to Splash Country the next day. I hate swimming or getting wet, so I just watched everyone else. They had a blast. Surprisingly,  Goats on the Roof was probably my favorite place. The goats were so cute and they had amazing fudge. It was definitely an odd place, but I loved it. We stayed in TN for 9 days, then went home. I want to go again next year.",,32EYX73OY1VJYORKVXWOAUOKD7YURX
