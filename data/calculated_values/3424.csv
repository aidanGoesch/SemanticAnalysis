I also got my hours at work reduced before Christmas and I just wanted to stay home and pull the covers over my head. Kelly text me and said she and Benji were going to see a show that night and they had an extra ticket if I wanted to go. I really didn't but I missed Kelly's birthday party in November and I was feeling guilty about it so I felt I could say no again so I grudgingly went along. The band was called Kero Bonito and I only knew them a little. I have seen their stuff on a few Stopify playlists but wouldn't call myself a fan. The night was a bit boring really and the warm up acts were terrible. Several times I just wanted to leave because it wasn't my scene. Well, Kero Bonito are a much better live band because when they did come out they just smashed it. They were fantastic and they put on one of the best shows I have ever been to. I forgot all about my problems and just let go for the first time in weeks. I was dancing and singing (had to make up some lyrics!) and just acting like a big goof. I swear just allowing myself to be happy and to focus on the moment was so badly needed. It was like a religious experience. I just felt like I was in my body and felling all my feelings rather than being in my head thinking and thinking and thinking (negatively) like I've been doing the past few weeks. I'm not sure if this is me turning over a new leaf but I do think the feeling has carried into my life and things don't feel so bleak now. Sometimes, we just have to get out of our heads but it's not easy. Hopefully it's the start of better things to come?",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKMO1EVL
