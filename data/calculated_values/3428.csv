My wife, our three kids, and my dad had all decided that they were going to treat me to a day of fun stuff tailored specifically to me. I'm not normally the type to indulge myself as I'm usually so busy taking care of others but I decided to just lean into everything and enjoy myself. We drove to downtown Los Angeles for a wonderful Italian lunch at Bestia. During lunch, I was struck by the free flowing nature of the conversation, the spontaneous bursts of irreverence and quirkiness that are emblematic of a close family. I was profoundly moved by the precocious nature of our kids interacting with my dad because it made me feel like a bridge between two generations of family. I could see very clearly how the best aspects of what my dad had taught me about being a parent were being passed down to his grandkids, who in turn were on their way to becoming well rounded adults. This illustrated itself vividly as we moved on to the after lunch event, a screening of Laurel and Hardy's classic comedy ""Sons of the Desert"", one of my all time favorites, and a movie that my Dad had shared with me when I was a child. I'd seen the move dozens of times I was enthralled by the hilarious comedy of errors unfolding onscreen but our kids were utterly and completely involved in that special way when one encounters timeless art. As they rolled in the aisles, doubling over from hysterical laughter, I felt a singular sense of joy and accomplishment. My dad had given me something precious, and after cultivating it for years I was handing it off to my kids for their own pleasure. It was then that I realized that beyond material gifts, what really matters on birthdays is reflecting on where you're going, who is going on the journey with you, and what we're all learning on the way there. As a kid, my dad always treated me as an intellectual equal because he figured that what I didn't understand would only pique my curiosity to learn more. In turn, I tend to do the same with my kids and the effect is the same. Their quest becomes something that we all get involved in and by doing so we all end up learning something about each other. This engenders closeness, and what I realized that day is just how close I feel to the people with whom I'm sharing this wonderful life with. To me that's the essence of family.",3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOQL2G,3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOQL2G
