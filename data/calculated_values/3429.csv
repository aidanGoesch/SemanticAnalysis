I was smitten. Anytime I had the opportunity, I would daydream about us being together. Unfortunately, nothing ever came from it. She was never interested in me. I had tried to pursue her, but I was shut down. As much as it hurt, I never forgot my first love. A few months ago, I found out she passed away. It seemed very sudden. Although I do not know how she passed away, it was a shock. It was quite traumatizing to me. First, the feelings I had for my first love resurface. Then, I started grieving by crying uncontrollably. Furthermore, I felt as if I were in her life, I could have done something to prevent this. Although it was 25 years ago, I still feel very strongly about her. Her death brought back all those strong feelings like a ton of bricks.",,3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOZL2P
