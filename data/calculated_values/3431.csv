I grieve his death everyday. Just recently, his family finally held the funeral for his ashes. It was extremely hard to see his family during this time. I wish we could have spent more time together. I was working alot and but we were arranging plans to spend our summer together. We were going to sit by bon fires and listen to music. We both enjoyed doing the same things as hobbies. We also shared the same sense of humor. Life will never be the same without my love. I have been fighting depression and i dream of him almost every night. Sometimes, i think i see him and i do not know if its my mind playing tricks on me. I have a new boyfriend now but he is nothing like my love. I do not think im going to stay with him. He doesnt make me laugh like my soulmate did. I have been talking to his daughter every day trying to help her heal from the loss of her father. In some ways, helping her heal helps me to heal. They say time will heal but i really think it is how i internally process his death and it can be for the best or the worst. I am choosing to embrace the love that we once shared and not to focus on his passing as much.",3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOZL2P,
