It was an accidental death and he was only 41. I was at work on my break when my sister called and she was crying. She told me to sit down. I was already in my car. After she had told me the devastating news, I cried for months. I still cry when  I think about him. I went to the wake and it was an open casket. It was very difficult looking at him with no life in him. I believe that his spirit is still with and me visits me at times. I had planned on spending my summer with him. We were going to go to restaurants and sit by a bonfire. We had a lot of plans. We had even talked about moving in together. I miss him very much and not a day goes by that I do not think about him. The family had my love cremated. Today is the funeral. It is happening as I type this. I could not attend  due to my work schedule. The family may be slightly upset at me for not attending. The wake was very hard for me. I cannot handle the distress. My soul will always be with my first true love and we will be reunite once again. I feel this deeply. You never forget your first love.",3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOZL2P,3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOZL2P
