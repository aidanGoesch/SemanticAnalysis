I thought it would be a lot of fun to get all of the families together.  So I went ahead and rented a pretty large cabin.  It was really cool, the kitchen was wide open with a lot of windows looking out over the lake.  There were plenty of bedrooms for everyone so both my parents and my inlaws came along, along with our kids and some of their friends.  We all wanted to get out on the water and we rented some kayaks to use while we there.  Everyone was taking turns and having fun but my mother-in-law refused to try it.  Finally after a lot of pushing by just about everyone, she finally decided to give it a try.  It was so funny she was really pretty freaked out about the entire thing.  But she got in the kayak just fine and managed to have some fun kayaking along the shoreline.  It was hard not to laugh when she finished.  She got back to the dock and just stared at all of us.  She couldn't figure out the best way to climb back out of the kayak!  Some grandkids went over to help her.  They essentially had to pull her out.  We all got a good laugh out of it, even her.  It really was a great time and she thinks she may even kayak again sometime.",,3JPSL1DZ5TLE4HLUWLYG197G69PNA3
