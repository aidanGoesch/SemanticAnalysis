It was so crazy the way I found her, but I am grateful I did. I was driving home from work and I was on a side street. I remember seeing a young boy run out of the front door of his home crying. I kept driving. I assumed his mother had kicked him out for drawing on the walls or something. I looked in my rearview mirror and I saw that the young boy was running out into the road waving his arms, maybe something was wrong? I decided I would just drive around the block on more time and see if he looked injured or anything. As I approached his house for the second time he nearly jumped on top of my car, I had no choice but to stop. He started screaming through his sobs something about his mother. I jumped out of the car and got him to calm down enough so that I could understand he said his mother was having a baby. I ran to the front door and could hear the mother screaming out in pain. I walked inside and there she was, his mother was sprawled out on the floor bleeding and screaming in pain. I called 911 and somehow they managed to get to her house before the baby was born or before she lost too much blood. Ever since that day I don't ignore my gut feelings because if I had that day who knows what would have happened. When I saw her today she looked great, and the baby is already getting so big. It was nice to see them and to feel how appreciated they consider me.",,3JPSL1DZ5TLE4HLUWLYG197GVJVNAI
