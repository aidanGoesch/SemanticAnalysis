As the month have passed by it has gotten a little easier, I never really had time to get to close to him honestly. I have visited his grave site a few times as well and it is still a very sad experience. We have learned that SIDs was the cause of his death. My sister-in-law is still traumatized over his death and still has not got over it in even the little. She is trying to get pregnant again. Most of us believe that she is doing it for all the wrong reasons. I still remember the day that we learned that he was gone and I can only imagine how hard this is for my sister-in-law. They have had trouble getting his tombstone payed for. They have even had to fight against the rumors that have been spread about them. This whole experience has really changed how I look at things. I now appreciate my children even more and watch them more closely while they sleep.  I am very terrified that something might end up happening to my children. It almost throws me into a panic attack to even think about it. I know that everything happens for a reason but this is something that I still do not really understand.",3JRJSWSMQI7AQQ9WU7GNOEZ1KI6E33,
