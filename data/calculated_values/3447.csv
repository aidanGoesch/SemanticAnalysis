I was able to marry someone I consider my best friend. We have known each other since our college days. So we have been close for a long time. I always dreamed of marrying my best friend, and this came to pass, as I married my husband. He is my best friend, and this is all I wanted. The event was great. A lot of family and friends and well wishers came around. We had a great reception, and it was awesome. We went ahead to a great honeymoon in the tropics. We loved every moment of it. We returned to a great life. We have made it work up to this point. It has been fulfilling. I hope it lasts forever.",,3JV9LGBJWU0XWTY9J0Q3CKIOMAGGOG
