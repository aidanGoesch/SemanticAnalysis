We have been together for almost 16 years.  We finally got married in February of this year.  We always thought we would wait until we could afford a big wedding.  This year, we realized that it was just more important to us to be married.  We had a small wedding, with just the two of us.  It wasn't the most romantic thing in the world and I did not get to wear a dress.  But I was and still am perfectly ok with that.  It was us, together, and that is all that will ever matter.  Knowing that I can call him husband, makes butterflies flit inside my stomach even now.  It has been a very long, challenging road for us.  Standing across from him and saying those two simple words, I do, had such a huge impact on me.  I never realized what such a small thing as marriage would make me feel.  It's always been something that was just a piece of paper to me.  But standing before someone else and promising to love and cherish him forever, it felt good.  It felt like we were finally reaching a point where we could move forward, into a bright and happy future together.",3JV9LGBJWU0XWTY9J0Q3CKIOMAGGOG,3JV9LGBJWU0XWTY9J0Q3CKIOMAGGOG
