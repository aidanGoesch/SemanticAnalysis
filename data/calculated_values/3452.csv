He was a jealous person before and after we got married. He was so upset with me he decided to call child protective services on me. I'm a good mother and he had nothing to fault me with so he made something up. He told thm I neglect her, she didn't have any clothes, and I have untreated postpartum depression, none of which was true. CPS actually came to my home to interview me. They even went to my daughter's school to question her. It was the most upset and embarassed I've ever been in my life. She said she felt embarassed and afraid of these people in suits who pulled her out of class. He put my daughter at risk of being taken away from me as well as caused her mental trauma. But I believe karma has intervened. He was just involved in a huge car accident. His car was totaled and the accident was his fault. He was injured and had to go to the hospital and miss days of work while he recovered. So I definitely believe karma comes back to haunt those who do others wrong. I didn't retaliate but I didn't have to because he got what he deserved.",,3JV9LGBJWU0XWTY9J0Q3CKIOTC2OGL
