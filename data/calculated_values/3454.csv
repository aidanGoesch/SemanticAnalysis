My son finally got married. He found a lovely lady to be subservient to him. She is submissive and doesn't have any opinions about anything. She has been looking forward to this wedding for her whole life, it's literally the only thing she was ever taught to care about. They had a beautiful ceremony. It was amazing. I am so happy that she was able to live out her bourgeois fantasy of having everyone show up to give her attention for getting married. I had such a good time and it made me love our culture. These are people who have absolutely no understanding of contemporary politics, all they know is Disney fantasies. It is good that they are able to shield themselves from reality. My sister thinks it's self indulgent. She's wrong. She's some kind of political activist or something. Anyway, the wedding was amazing! I love weddings!! I am SO HAPPY FOR MY SON! MARRIAGE IS INHERENTLY AMAZING!",,3JV9LGBJWU0XWTY9J0Q3CKIOUECGOS
