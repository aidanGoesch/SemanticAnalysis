I didn't realize how many emotions it would stir up from my old college days. When I moved into my dorm room I was so nervous about what my room mate would be like and how well we would get along. My brother on the other hand was excited at the thought of meeting someone new that he could possibly become life long friends with.  I saw my brother decorating his room and how much fun he was having doing. When I went to college I was so nervous and anxious that I didn't even think about what my decor would be. After he was done decorate his side of the room we decided to walk around campus to get a feel for how everything was. When we got to his cafeteria I have to admit I was a little bit jealous because the food variety was way better than what my school offered. As we toured the rest of campus together I looked around at all the other new freshmen and it brought back all those feelings of what I felt on my first day. I was a little sad after I realized college was so many years ago. Those were the days when I had so little responsibility. I remember thinking would I meet any cute guys. Would I make friends? I was scared of failing and letting my family down. Would I pick the right major? How would I know what major was right for me? Then I realized this wasn't about me but about my little brother. We walked back to his dorm and his room mate had showed up. I looked at him and I could see him beaming with the biggest smile. I knew he would be alright. I hugged him and told him I'll talk to him later and can't wait to hear how things went.,,3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHY007WWQ
