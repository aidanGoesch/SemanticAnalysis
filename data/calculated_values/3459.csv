The baby was so tiny I was so scared to hold the baby once I was allowed because I was afraid I might break something on him. While pregnant my  doctor told me I should get an abortion because my baby more than likely had down syndrome. She told me they could administer a test that would let me know for sure if he in fact had down syndrome. The test involved sticking a needle into my stomach and retrieving fluid from the wound to diagnose the baby. The problem was that if I agreed to the test it would increase the chances of the baby actually having down syndrome. It didn't make any sense to me because I figured I didn't need to know if the baby had it or not because I would love him no matter the circumstances. Fast forward to 4 months ago and I feel a sharp pain while on the toilet at home, I immediately call 911 and get into ambulance. By time i made it to a room and they went and got the doctor the baby was already out. he was 3 months earlier than his due date. I could tell right away that the baby did not have down syndrome but I wasn't particularly worried about that I was more concerned about if he was breathing and yes, indeed he was. he fought his way through the NICU and came after only two months. He will have some developmental delays besides the ones that are obvious from being premature but overall I am just happy that I have my baby and love him to death. he is a joy.",,3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHY00KWW3
