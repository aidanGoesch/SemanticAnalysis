My hubs is not the type to go above and beyond for things, but he is thoughtful. So when he said we could go to my favourite restaurant, Hamirs, and go and see a movie, I was excited to do so! I had not been to Hamir's in so long, and I know my hubs isn't the biggest Indian food fan, so I thought it was so sweet that he would want to go there anyway, even though it's not his favourite. When we went to Hamirs, I noticed there were gorgeous sheets in these beautiful Indian prints hanging over the front windows. Usually the windows are really open and you can see inside. When we walked in, I was completely overwhelmed to see about a dozen of my friends and close co-workers! I was so surprised! When I was hugging everyone and screaming and smiling and 'yay'ing' over it, I noticed in the corner, my best friend from HS, waiting for me!! I couldn't believe it! She had come all the way from Massachusetts to see me! I started crying and she started crying, and we had such a moment! I had not seen her for about 3-4 years. The food was absolutely amazing and the conversation and just ambiance was so perfect! Hamir made my favourite dish, which is the chicken tandoori! The dinner and my friends showing up was a big enough gift, but I also received so many awesome gifts! Lots of Starbucks and Sephora gift cards! My best friend got me a Kate Spade wallet. My mom and sister got me a new pair of headphones. My husband went above and beyond for this one, it was crazy. I couldn't believe he went to all this, and behind my back without me knowing. Somehow, he was able to reach out to everyone. When I asked him how he did it, he said he found our addresses/email list that I keep on excel on our computer, and he was able to contact everyone via the email addresses I had in there. I was super bummed because I didnt take any photos but luckily, so many of my friends came through! When I got on facebook and IG the next day, there were so many tagged photos. It was awesome to see the different people in my life all in one space. My work friends, my new friends my old friends, and my family. I never really had many big birthday parties in my life, and I never had a surprise party, so this was a first for me, and it is truly something that I will treasure for a long time.",3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHYPG3WW7,
