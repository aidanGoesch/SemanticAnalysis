I had not planned on doing anything special. I was thinking maybe dinner with my husband and a few friends, or even just drinks out with my girlfriends. I was texting with a few of my friends and everyone had plans like graduation parties or trips scheduled. I didn't think anything of it, and my husband asked me if I wanted to go to dinner and see a movie. So we went to my favourite restaurant, and as the hostess took us to the back, there were 7-8 of my friends, plus several of my favourite coworkers waiting! SURPRISE! They yelled. I was so shocked and excited! From the one side, I saw one of my best friends since high school pop out! She came all of the way from Massachusetts to see me! I couldn't hold it in then. It was so exciting, touching, and beautiful! Everyone was there to celebrate my birthday, and I could not ask for anything more than that. We had so much fun with everyone, chatting and laughing and telling crazy stories. I loved having my newer friends meeting my older friends and my coworkers being a part of it too. It was truly a time I will never forget. I have never really had any surprise parties in my life or even really by birthday parties, so it was nice to have everyone come together for my special day!",3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHYPG3WW7,3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHYPG3WW7
