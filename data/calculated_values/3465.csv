Early in the morning me and my wife started arguing. We were arguing about buying a new car because we were mostly arguing about how it is not easy to plan and choose to buying a car. The arguing carried mostly until lunchtime, we somehow dialed it down after lunch. During lunch time my two daughters made me cook some SPAM for their lunch, these little kiddos love that processed meat. I usually try to make it similar to breakfast because I don't usually get to eat breakfast that often anymore. So I cooked some sunny ide up eggs too and some hashbrowns alongside with the SPAM. During the evening, that's when we wen to the dealership. My wife surprised me on how she did her research after we argued, she surprisingly followed my strategies in finding the best deal possible.  Me and my wife also brought in the kids, they just played around close to me while I was with the salesperson. I was definitely feeling it that me and my wife was very sure about one particular car. The salesperson was even a lot more transparent than usual. Long story short, we bought the black hybrid car. I was so happy and proud at the same time for my wife. She was also forgiving because I am usually short tempered when we argue.",3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMEWJNB7,3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMEWJNB7
