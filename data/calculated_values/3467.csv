Not too long ago, a childhood classmate of mine died of cancer at the age of 16. I was quite saddened by this event. However, during the funeral, I felt funny.  Everyone around me mourned for the death of a sixteen year old boy while I stood in the background. I was quite emotionless, and stood like a statue. How does this relate to me being a class clown and outgoing personality? Well, I'll tell you. After the funeral, family and friend attended his wake. While there I was able to catch up with old friends that I hadn't seen in years. Everyone tried to keep a smile on their face but the death of a fallen comrade watched over us like a stormy cloud sucking all the happiness and life out of the room. This is when my personality seemed to kick in to second gear. Sadness? Not if l could help it. Before I knew what was happening, I was buzzing all over the banquet room telling jokes here and there. Talking to family members of my dead friend as if we had known each other for years when in actuality the death of their brother, nephew, or cousin was what brought us together in the first place. I tried my best to make everyone forget what had actually happened. Hours later, walking home in a 3 piece suit. Jacket hung over my shoulder like I was a tough guy from the 20's, I smiled. My effort had been a success. I knew that in my own way, I was sort of a superhero.",,3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMGMHBNB
