There have been times my car had been run into when it was parked on the next street over, but that's about it. Tonight, however, was a different story. I heard a huge bang outside from the living room. I looked outside, and saw smoke fuming from a SUV. A driver slammed into a guard rail in front of my house. Afraid the car would blow up, I rushed out there to rescue the driver and any passengers.  I saw that the driver had beer in his hand. I pulled him out of the car and dragged him to safety. Then, I called 911. Thankfully, other neighbors did just that before I did. I waited on the phone outside my house as they were on their way. About three minutes later, emergency personnel arrived. They questioned what took place. I told them to the best of my ability and honestly. They saw that he has a record of drinking while driving. Thankfully, the worst damage he did was to a guard rail and his vehicle. He could have done that to another driver or person walking on the road.",,3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMNPANBT
