My son and my husband were also in the front yard playing football. I heard a loud crash and looked towards the road to see a car had smashed into the guard rail coming down the road. The car went a bit out of control of the driver and starting sideways on the road as the road curved towards my house. I thought the car was going to flip once it hit the grass, so i started to get up and run towards my son. I didn't get very far when the car thankfully came to a stop just inches from the side of the road. The driver turned at looked at us as he was sitting in an old classic convertible car. I could see him holding something, but didn't realize what it was when I then hear my husband yell ""He's got a beer in his hand!!"" The driver then sped off down the road. I immediately went inside and called 911 to tell them there's a drunk driver that hit the guard rail and almost killed himself and my family. A cop later drove by to look at the damage of the guardrail. He mentioned to my husband that they didn't find any beer cans, but they did get him for a DUI. This week I just received a letter that I am subpoenaed for this event. The court date is next week. Today, his skid marks from his tires are still on the road in front of my house. I don't want to go to the court hearing.",3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMNPANBT,3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMNPANBT
