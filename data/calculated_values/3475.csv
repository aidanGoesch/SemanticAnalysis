She was a very well respected doctor in our area as well as a great friend to many people. The event took place at a local farm and it was a truly beautiful venue to honor her. At least a hundred people showed up to give condolences and celebrate what an amazing woman my mother was. There were obviously lots of tears, but also laughter as we remembered her. My brother played a piece on the piano that she used to love. People came from all over the country to support me and my family. A lot of my personal friends also showed up. Some of the women who came to support me hadn't even met my mother! They were there simply to support me in my time of grief. The greatest support came from my boyfriend, though. We started dating about a month before my mother's passing. His loyalty and love has been instrumental in helping me get through this. Two of my closest girlfriends were also there. Both of those women are in college still, and they took time away from classes to come and be with me. The outpouring of love was amazing!",3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMOSXNBN,
