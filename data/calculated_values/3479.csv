I have a lot of knowledge about fantasy football.  I wanted to share my knowledge with the world.  I decided to research by looking at how other fantasy football podcasters do their shows.  Looking up different kinds of software was the next step.  Adobe suite was my preference.  They have different tools for creating video.  I wrote a summary of what would happen this week in fantasy football.  I did a video about the summary.  I posted the video online.  I shared it with all my friends.  My friends shared it.  Everyone liked it.  I did the same thing next week.  More people started watching.  I began to make money off of the advertising that showed before the video.  I was happy that I was successful.,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO,
