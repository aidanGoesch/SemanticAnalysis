Things between us, though initially exciting, felt stale and disingenuous. On our last night together, my partner was behind the wheel. After some time passed, I turned to them and said quietly, ""I think I would like to go home."" They were silent, but abruptly obliged. Only, they started driving really recklessly. They were going too fast, cursing under their breath. I felt really afraid. I'd never seen them react like that. They insisted they were fine, their behavior behind the wheel said otherwise, however. Once we reached my house, I said quietly, ""I don't think this is working."" I exited the car and never saw them again. Our relationship never dove past the surface. I am curious, playful, I like to ask questions, pontificate about life, our purpose, the world.  We didn't share that quality. They are stern, emotionless, robotic. Often met my musings with silence or a blank stare.",3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9ATE8GFM,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9ATE8GFM
