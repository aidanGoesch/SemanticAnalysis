All my coworkers helped me out by giving me a going away part. It was at a local brewery. There were lots of people there. Almost everyone from work. I got card and gift. And plenty of cake was flowing around. I was glad for all my managers and colleagues that helped me while I was there. They are true friends. My time with the company was great. It was good to have good friends and leaders there to help me when I needed them. I am glad I was a part of the company. It was very nice to see that they are true friends. The party was fun. I felt that everyone there was a true friend to me.,,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9AZU8GFO
