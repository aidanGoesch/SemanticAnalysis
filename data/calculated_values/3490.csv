In my last week at work, my coworkers decided to throw a surprise farewell party for me. We went to a local microbrewery. My boss decided to cover the drinks. Some of my colleagues also ordered pizza. I spent times talking about my next endeavor with my colleagues. We took group pictures. My manager gave a speech. I also had a chance to do so and thanked everyone. I was given cards, farewell gifts and cakes. I was quite sad leaving because everyone was very collaborative and my work environment felt like a family. Also, I moved to a different city, and probably won't be visiting in a while. I was glad that I was able to talk to almost everyone and people were supportive of my decision. I was also glad that everyone seemed to be having a good time. I still had good memories about my previous job.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9AZU8GFO
