I agreed to talk to them because I was curious.  At one study they started talking about how when we die we go to sleep until Armegeddon or the end of the world.  I stopped them and gave the account of my mother passing and what she saw.  Seconds before my mother passed away she said "" Mom, Dad, Jesus its beautiful"".  She was at peace and happy when she said this.  It was the belief of everyone in the room including myself, that she did see what she said.  I told the women from the JW's that I didn't believe what they believe.  I have seen first hand that that wasn't true.  The women weren't sure how to respond and tried to use bible quotes from their own ""bible"" to try to convince me.  I let them know I will never believe what they are saying and they are wasting their time.  One of the women said to me, "" You are questioning the 'bible' and who else questioned Jehovah""? ""Satan""!  I said ""Are you calling me Satan""?  She just sat there.  The other woman said ""I don't think that's what she meant"".  I then asked them to leave.",3K2755HG5TP0EWBPI765J56DNZ0DFE,
