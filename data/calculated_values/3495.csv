Initially she had been diagnosed 4 years prior and was given 6 months to live.  She had received chemotherapy and radiation and nothing helped.  Our family had gone to Medjugorje in Bosnia as my mother was very religious and wanted to visit the shrine.  We spent 10 days there and hiked up the mountain to the shrine.  Upon our return to the United States her cancer had disappeared.  Fast forward 4 years after almost being declared cancer free, her cancer returned.  She fought every step of the way to live but eventually the cancer overtook her.  While in the hospital as she lay dying, she said she saw Jesus, her parents, and a beautiful place.  Those were her last words and died less than a minute after speaking them.  We were all speechless.  We received peace that day that she was happy and with ones she loved in a beautiful place. I learned a lot of this experience.  The main thing was not to fear death or dying.  That the end of a life even though we miss that person incredibly can be a peaceful and beautiful passage.",3K2755HG5TP0EWBPI765J56DNZ0DFE,3K2755HG5TP0EWBPI765J56DNZ0DFE
