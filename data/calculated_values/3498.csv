After he and my mother got divorced when I was a kid we very gradually drifted apart and had less and less contact until he was only calling on my birthday. Then some time in my 20s even that stopped, and for several years we had no contact at all. Recently he called me out of the blue. We had a long conversation and reconnected. It felt really good to be able to bond with my step-father again. I was glad to find out that he's in good health despite being in his 70s. We generally were able to catch up on each other's lives. He's still working as a substitute teacher from time to time, and I told him I'm working at a restaurant. An unfortunate thing I found out while talking to him was that his younger sister passed away from cancer. It was very sad to hear this as I remember her well from my childhood. I also know they were very close to one another so I tried to console him the best that I could. Overall this was a very significant and emotionally moving event for me that I still think about from time to time. We've since talked a couple more times. I'm optimistic it will lead to more of a relationship in the future.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ55D9UC,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ55D9UC
