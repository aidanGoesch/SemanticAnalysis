My brother called to let me know. I was expecting it, because my brother had called the night before to say the facility my dad was at had contacted my mom and told her he was not doing well, and they expected the worse. My brother asked if I was going to go over to the facility, but I said not tonight, but that I would go in the morning. I have mixed feelings about that decision. You see, my dad had been diagnosed with Parkinson's and had been moved to an assistant living facility for people with chronic mental issues when my mom was no longer able to care for him. He was pretty much in a vegetative state in that he didn't speak or move. He breathed unassisted and had to be fed, bathed and changed. I had visited him a few times at the facility and hated seeing him that way. He didn't communicate with me at all. I talked to him but had no idea if he was hearing any of it. He lay on his side in a semi-fetal position, his hands frozen in a curled, claw like posture; his face expressionless, his mouth frozen in an open position.  His eyes didn't move or follow you in any way. I secretly hoped he would pass on quietly and peacefully in his sleep, sooner rather than later. I didn't know what else to do. He wasn't going to get any better, and no one knew how long this would go on. I remember thinking how can anyone in this world think this is the way anyone would want to live? It made me think how selfish people were, because the only people who could see this as an acceptable way for another person to live would be someone not going through it, but willing to put someone else through it just so they would not have to deal with the death of a loved one. If it was possible to choose to have him euthanized, I would have done it. But that is not an option in our ""civilized"" world, so I was stuck just hoping nature would take its course, sooner rather than later. I do not regret those thoughts. I do, however, regret not having gone to the facility the night my brother called and being by my dad's side when he died. I honestly do not know if I did not go because I honestly thought he would make it until the next day, or if I just didn't want to see him that way again. I still struggle with that decision and the reasons behind it.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ7OG9UJ,
