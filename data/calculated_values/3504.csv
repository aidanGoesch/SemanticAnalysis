I know it was for the best, but I still can't help feeling depressed about it. He died in an assisted living facility for people with Parkinson's and other chronic mental issues. He wasn't getting any better, only worse. He was diagnosed a couple of years ago, and had become immobile in the last six months. The last time I visited him, he couldn't move or speak: he was frozen in a clenched, tense state, and his face literally looked like Edvard Munch's ""The Scream"" (I kid you not!). He looked so empty. It was so depressing I never went back and secretly hoped he'd pass away sooner rather than later. Now that he has, I feel very depressed and a little angry that none of us were there for it, and that there isn't a more dignified way for us to leave this world. I don't understand why when a person reaches that state, his family can't choose to plan his death so that they could all be there to say goodbye one last time. I mean, he was like a plant: they fed and bathed him, washed and changed him. No one could even tell us if he was still understanding anything we were saying. It just seems more just to me to plan his exit: pick a date so we could all be there for the entire day with him. Then, at some point, the doctor could just give him an overdose of morphine or something. But I guess that is inhumane, unlike letting someone slowly waste away in a strange place with no family and trapped inside a body that no longer works. Some things just make no sense. I just hope when my day comes that if it isn't quick and sudden, I still have enough wherewithal to take care of it myself-- because no one else is going to.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ7OG9UJ,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ7OG9UJ
