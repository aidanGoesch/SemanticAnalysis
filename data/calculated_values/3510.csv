It was the middle of August and the weather was hot out in the desert but was cool inside the casinos.  Everyone was excited to try their luck at the tables and slot machines so the first day there we spent a few hours gambling.  No one won anything big and we all learned the meaning of the phrase ""The house always wins.""  We chose not to push our luck any further and spent the evening taking in a Las Vegas show, which was very enjoyable and picked everyone's spirits up.  The next day we set out for the Grand Canyon, which is only a few hours drive from Las Vegas.  We were all excited to see one of nature's greatest wonders.  I had been told by many of my friends that the Grand Canyon was awe inspiring, and they weren't wrong.  I was stunned by the sheer natural beauty of the massive canyon.  I was surprised to find that most of the canyon doesn't have anything to protect people from falling over the edge.  Looking down the incredibly steep ravine was scary to say the least.  After walking the rim for two hours we drove back into the Grand Canyon Park and enjoyed a nice picnic lunch in the middle of the woods.  It was peaceful and seemed to recharge everyone.  We headed back to the canyon and decided to check out a different section.  It is hard to describe how beautiful and big the Grand Canyon is.  There is an incredible view in every direction.  Before we knew it the sun began to set and the whole day had passed.  The setting sun slipping below the endless horizon of the canyon is a sight to behold.",,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQHMIU9C
