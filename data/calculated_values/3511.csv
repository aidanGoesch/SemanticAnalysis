We all got together a few weeks earlier and planned everything from what activities we'd be doing to how much money everything would cost. We got our plane tickets and had a nice flight to the city. The experience was fantastic as we went to visit several casinos and resort locations. We also visited Freemont Street which had a ton of attractions, people, and local events. A few days after we took a day trip to visit the Grand Canyon and go on a bus tour. The experience of that was unlike any other especially since I come from the suburbs of New Jersey. There was a ton of tourists there and besides the massive caverns and the canyon itself, I was floored by the beauty of the landscapes and colors of it all. After that day we went to a concert in one of the casinos to see a Michael Jackson impressionist and performances. We also attended a small magic show that cost practically nothing. We didn't gamble too much but we tried a little bit. Our hotel was nice too although nothing too fancy. We tried to spend our money wisely and carefully as even food costs were expensive. Luckily one of our friends knew people from Vegas and we got a nice buffet deal for a few days. By the end of the trip we were all pretty exhausted and ready to go home. It was a fantastic experience but it's not something I'd do all the time.",,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQHMIU9C
