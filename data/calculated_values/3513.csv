She inviting some of her friends from school to celebrate.  We had about 10 kids total come.  We celebrated by having a pinata for the kids to hit, a hula hoop competition; it was really fun!  I made the party as girly as possible.  There was a lot of pink decorations, like flamingos placed around. One of the gifts she received was a play make-up kit which she used during the party to dress up herself and her friends.  She really liked that.  We had a ton of sweets at the party and even had a cotton candy maker there.  This birthday was a very special birthday!  We (at the time) lived in a house that had very little land.  Our family had always dreamt of having our very own hobby farm.  My husband and myself had worked hard for years to make sure this dream would become a reality.  My daughter, had always wanted her very own horse.  She has asked us to get her a horse ever since she was very little.  Unfortunately, we were not able to afford the care and board of a horse if it was not on our own property.  My husband and myself went house hunting to find the perfect hobby farm to surprise our daughter with for her birthday.  Then, to let her know that her dream of owning a horse would soon be true.  We found a cute house that had 10 acres, enough for a couple of horses if we truly wanted.  At her party we were able to surprise her with the news!  She was so excited she could hardly contain herself.  To most young girls, they wouldn't even think of aspiring to have the simplicity in life. She wanted to connect with animals and nature.  Now were were providing that to her.   It was a birthday to remember!",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,
