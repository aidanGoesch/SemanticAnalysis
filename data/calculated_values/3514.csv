We were just having a simple family party, but we were taking it to the next level.  I wanted to make it fun and lively.  I purchased a bunch of pink flamingo decor to decorate the walls and tables.  I purchased a cute flamingo puffy straw to adorn the party cups.  I played music by Marshmello, who is her favorite musician.  For her gifts, I purchased her a bunch of squishes, and some play make up.  We had all of her cousins come, which totaled about 10 kids.  We had games like pinata hitting, hula hoop competition, and limbo.  Her cake I decorated pink and purple with many pastel colored sprinkles.  This birthday was a large celebration as she has always dreamed of having a horse again.  Unfortunately, our property is small and we could no longer afford the board in our area for a horse.  So, we sold the one we had years ago.  This year, I was able to gift her with something that most people wouldn't even think would matter to a young girl.  I was able to tell her we were buying a house out in the country that had enough acreage for a horse!  She was over the moon excited.  Our little half acre lot that we lived in would eventually turn into 10 acres in our new home.  She would have the room to ride and play like she had always dreamt of doing.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H
