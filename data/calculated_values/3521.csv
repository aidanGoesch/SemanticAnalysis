It is my birth country, before my family decided to move to America when I was a small child. I have not been back for over 20 years, so it was like stepping back to my childhood. When I first went back to my neighborhood, it was like nothing I remembered. It's almost as if this was not the place I grew up and everyone was just lying to me. I was in a complete state of shock seeing people that I have not seen in 20 years. Kids in the neighborhood were now grown adults, and look nothing like I remember them. I was in a sense of disbelief, and just in a daze the whole time. Its funny when you move away from somewhere for a long time you're expecting time to stand still. The whole place just seem a lot smaller, maybe because as a kid everything is just bigger. A lot of people moved away that I grew up with, I guess I expected. I went back to visit my old school that I went to, trying to find my old teachers and classmates. Doing this made me realized how long 20 years really is. No one was there, the school was shut down and no one was in sight. This kinda made me sad, like a whole part of my life was erased. I don't know if I regret going back or I'm happy about it, guess I'm still trying to process things.",,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ38DGAI
