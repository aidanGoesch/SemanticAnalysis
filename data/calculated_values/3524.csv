We were in Greece, a place that we always wanted to visit one day. We were in the capital Athens. We spent a long day exploring the city and eating all of the good food that we could find. We were shocked by the cheap prices and the amazing view. We went to visit all of the cultural relics that you only read about in history books. At night after a nice of dancing and drinking, I thought it was the perfect time to show her, my best friend and girlfriend the gift I got her. I took her hiking up a tall mountain so we could see the whole city from the mountain side. As we glared at the beautiful city lights against a awesome night sky. I dropped down on one knee and asked her to marry me and to be my best friend and wife for the rest of my life. She shook her head yes as tears rolled down her cheeks, so surprised that I picked this awesome moment to propose. It was an awesome moment that none of us will ever forget. We took pictures as she texted all of her friends the news. It is a moment that we constantly regal in fondness. That night will be a night I will always remember as the night my best friend became my fiance.",,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ5XJAGY
