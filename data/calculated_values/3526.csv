My son always loved mountain biking and was getting quite good at it. When I agreed to bike on some trails with him I was not sure what to expect, however I was excited to see what it's like. I knew how to bike quite well but I hadn't gone on any serious mountain bike trails yet. I remember when we arrived at the trail, he told me to follow him and that he would go slow. I was surprised how much stamina and focus it took to go down these trails right away but I kept up with my son at first. After a few minutes of going down the trail, however, my memory of the event gets hazy. What I do remember is that the trail started to feature these large jumps, and my son would back flip off every single one. So I figured since he's doing so many back flips, I would be able to do at least one pretty easily. The last I remember is getting so much air off the jump that I was headed straight into a river next to the trail. After that I don't remember anything until I woke up in the hospital, but my son tells me I performed a triple back flip off the biggest jump and landed straight in the river, and that he was able to get me out. But when he did, I apparently wasn't breathing, and thankfully he was CPR certified and was successful. Since then my memory has been pretty bad, I think I hit my head on a rock even though I was wearing a helmet. Since then I have been pretty terrified of biking at all. But I know one day I'll have to face my fear and perform that trick again, even though my son tells me not to.",,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ5XRGAC
