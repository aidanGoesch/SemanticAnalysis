I was sitting quietly working on my computer and just died.  My son came in and found me and pulled me to the floor.  I had suffered a cardiac arrest.  My son called 911 and they talked him through cpr as the emergency crew was on their way.  They got to the house and shocked me 2 times and then rushed me to the hospital.  I was evaluated and put into a coma to be transported to another hospital and off I went.  I was in there for about a week before I realized what had happened and what was going on.  I was sent for testing and sent home after that week.  I was in the newpaper and on the facebook page of local town.  Pretty weird although I don't remember anything that happened from just before I went down to a week later.  Not something I really want to remember anyway.  I do remember being very sore from the broken ribs from the cpr my son gave me and that is about it.  just a crazy time.  I am shocked that my son held it together to revive me.  If not for him being home I would have died.  I would have had no chance at all.  I actually had no major brain damage although I have noticed a harder time remembering things at times.  I can be thinking of something and just can remember the exact word even though it is a basic word, nothing hard to remember but I just cant.  I work on it and eventually get it but it takes time.",3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ5XRGAC,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ5XRGAC
