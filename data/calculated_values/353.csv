I was freaking out pretty hard when it dawned on me that hey, I was marrying the girl of my dreams. The way we had met was spectacular, and totally happenstance. We had both been at a Spiritual guidance gathering at a retreat in the woods, and from the moment I saw her I knew that I needed to talk to her. I approached her with a soft smile on my face and we caught eyes, and I could immediately tell that she was the one. Now here we are, two and half years later, and I'm struggling with my damn tie and sweating and just overall a nervous wreck. Like I said, I realized that this is the girl of my dream, and the way we met was just serendipitous. I waited at the altar with a lump in my throat, waiting for her beautiful face to be led down the aisle by her Father. When that moment arrived, I was starstruck, I damn near fell over due to how beautiful she actually was, I hadn't actually seen her in about three days, due to the bachelorette party, and of course the tradition of the groom not seeing the bride before this moment on their wedding day. As soon as she reached the altar, I felt all the panick in my heart dissolve. We smiled at eachother and took one anothers hands as we looked towards the priest to begin the ceremony. I couldn't wait to make her mine, to bring her into my life as my wife, and I knew she felt the same way. It was absolutely lovely, and everything I could have expected and more. The reception was a blast as well, plenty of people laughing and telling happy stories of the two of us, and wishing us an absolutely blissful life together. That being said, I think we can leave the honeymoon out of this, because that might get a little racy, even for you diary. When we arrived home from the honeymoon, and I had to return to work, it was with great disdain that I left my new bride home alone, though I knew I would be back to see her in only eight short hours. I made haste to the office to begin my day and effectively my new life. When I walked into the office, I was immediately called into my supervisors office and I thought trouble immediately, only to be relieved that there was no trouble at all. In fact, it had been a promotion waiting for me for all of my diligent work and loyalty to the company. Could this get any better? I mean, I have had some pretty damn good luck all things considered, but is it really luck? Or is it this result of my hard work, patience and determination in succeeding in this life? I choose to believe that it's probably a mixture of both. I am more than pleased with the way my life is turning out so far!",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WNW49MZ
