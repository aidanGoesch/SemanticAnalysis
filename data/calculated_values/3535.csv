I was 34, almost 35 at the time of the injury. It would lead to my first surgery and would greatly impact my life. I was playing in a men's over-30 league. The game was on a Sunday. It was towards the end of the game. I felt fine all game, though I had a slight strain to my right hamstring from a previous game the week before. I took a free kick and the defense of the opposing team cleared it back towards our goal. I turned to chase the ball when I heard a pop and it felt like someone had kicked my heel. I fell to the ground immediately and the ref, who had been standing next to me, blew his whistle to stop the game. I looked around perplexed because no one was next to me, so I could not have been kicked. I was not in any pain, but my right ankle was unable to support me. The ref alerted my team that I would need help, he seemed more aware of what was going on than I did at the time. I said I was fine and crawled off the field. When I did, I started to realize something was pretty seriously wrong. I still was not in any pain, but I had broke out into a cold sweat and was feeling nauseous. My body had gone into shock. It seemed I had ruptured my Achilles tendon. I would not know this for sure until two days later when I finally relented and visited the doctor. I'm still amazed at how little pain I had and can only attribute it to going into shock right away. I also was given a pain reliever and ice almost immediately. Four days after the event I would have my first surgery. And for the past several months, I have been trying to recover from the injury.",,3K5TEWLKGWX6I4D1A0CKSOPC3ZCVI4
