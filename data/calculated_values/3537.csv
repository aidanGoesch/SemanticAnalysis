I was at the park with my girlfriend on a Saturday evening. We were basking in the ambiance of the park when something really disheartening happened. A group of teenagers who seemed playful initially started harassing another kid. Initially I felt they were just messing around until I observed one of the bullies strike the kid. I immediately rushed down and calmed things down. While doing so, scolded the offenders. Out of no where came one of the parent of the kids. She barely asked for an explanation before going berserk. She called me all sorts of unprintable names. She said I should be ashamed of myself for defending a Latino. It was quite shocking. She also yelled ""leave our country for us"" at the little kid. It was really horrible. It's an experience I'm actually ashamed of typing.",,3K5TEWLKGWX6I4D1A0CKSOPCEEZIVJ
