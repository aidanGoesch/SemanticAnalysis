There are a lot of thing that stress me out, and the possibility of drowning is definitely near the top of the list. That just goes to show how much I trust my friends, and how persuasive they can be. Three months ago my friends were able to get me in the car, wedged in the back seat between a surf board and giant cooler. I was lucky that my friends are experienced surfers. The fact that they knew what they were doing put me more at ease. With a little bit of coaxing and a lot of instruction, I was finally able to stand up on the board without falling down. The feeling of accomplishment was like a drug and it made me push even harder. I never would have thought that I could like something like surfing. I thought my fear of falling in the water would make me hate it, but that fear completely went away. I remember turning to my friends after the first time I successfully stayed on my board and seeing their beaming smiles. I think it might have meant just as much to them that I was able to overcome my fears. I guess that's what true friends do, they lift you up. I almost feel like I am addicted to surfing now. I spend a lot of time checking out surf videos online, and even purchased my very own board.",,3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B3PKEHA
