I had always wanted to learn how to surf, but either never had enough time for it, because I traveled a lot for work, or just never got around to it. Years went by, and I still had not learned how to surf, and I got older. Finally, I got around to finding some time, and my friends were willing to teach me. One Saturday they took me to the beach, and since they are all very good surfers, they took turns showing me what to do. I have always been a good swimmer, so I was not too frightened of the water and the waves, but I am older now, and I was afraid that I would not even be able to get up on the board, let alone surf. I managed to paddle out with them on the first try. They had gone over with me what I needed to do in order to push myself up on the board. So, in theory I had everything memorized, and now I just needed to put it into practice. Surprisingly getting up on the board was nowhere as hard as I thought it would be. I missed the first nice sized wave that came around, but I paddled and caught the following one. My friends were yelling and laughing, and then I heard clapping. Surprisingly I managed to push myself up, and stand up on the board on my first try. That was the biggest surprise. I rode the wave all the way to the shore without falling off. It was amazing. I fell in love with surfing that day, and I surf now as much as I can. I am practicing my technique, and just getting better with every time I get up on that board again.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B3PKEHA,
