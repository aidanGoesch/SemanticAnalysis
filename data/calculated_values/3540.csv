I have been telling them for years that I wanted to learn how to surf, but I never got around to it. I am an older person, and I was afraid that I would not be able to get up on the surfing board. I told them that I was going to train a little first by swimming in a pool every day for a few months before I attempt surfing. So, I did. Most of my friends surf, and some are excellent at it. This particular weekend they all got together, found a board for me, and took me to the beach since the waves were not too rough on that day, and perfect for a beginner. They were all trying to explain to me what I needed to do, and then they finally made me go out into the waves and try it. The experience was amazing. I was shocked that I got up onto the board on my first attempt. I certainly did not expect that. The feeling of gliding on the wave is difficult to describe. I surfed with my friends for the better part of the morning, until I was exhausted. This was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. I will never forget the wonder I felt on the first surfing day of my life. I am hoping that surfing will now become a regular part of my life. I already love water, and now I can incorporate into my love of water. Surfing immediately became one of my favorite sports. Instant love affair. The feeling of gliding on the water just can not be repeated.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B3PKEHA,3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B3PKEHA
