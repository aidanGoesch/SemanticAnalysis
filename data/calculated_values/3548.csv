I wanted to pursue law school, and I thought that practical working experience would be an invaluable way to select a type of law to practice as well as gain an understanding of what I was getting myself into. I applied online through many different websites but never heard back from employers, despite having completed a degree in Economics with a 3.9 GPA. Three months ago I was fed up with this application process, so I decided to pursue a job in person. I selected a firm from a list online that had the size and prestige of a company I wanted to work for. I put on a pair of black slacks and a button down shirt and rode the elevator up to the top floor of the largest building in the town I live in. I was shaking and my hands were sweaty. My car was parked in an illegal area down below. I handed my resume to the receptionist and explained that I wanted to work there. She seemed nice, but I felt like I wasn't wearing the right clothes and I was self conscious of my hair. I heard back from the Director of Operations a week later and then began the three interview process to get hired. They met with me for an hour each time and seemed to talk mostly about themselves, but I was thrilled that they were giving me their time. I deleted all of my online job search profiles in short order and considered writing thank you notes to the jobs that turned me down. I am now working at the firm and in the process of applying to law school. I will definitely visit these schools in person before applying.",,3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B5CKEHM
