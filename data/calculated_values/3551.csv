I booked a hotel room in a neighboring town. I made sure to choose a hotel with a swimming pool, as we both love to swim. When we arrived, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the hotel also had a whirlpool! We swam most of the day and relaxed in the whirlpool for a while. We were both hungry after swimming all afternoon, so we decided to have a steak dinner. We both ordered rib eye steaks and enjoyed the meal thoroughly.  After dinner, we drove to a movie theater to see the remake of The Lion King, one of his favorite movies of all time. The theater featured a state of the art sound and visual experience called RPX. I expected a large screen and fantastic sound, but what I did not expect were the seats...overstuffed leather electric recliners that adjusted to just about every position imaginable. My husband was overjoyed at the comfort of the seats because he suffers from back pain and I felt so happy that I had chosen a theater that would allow him to see this special movie in such a memorable way. The sound was incredible, not even close to the sound experience in the movie theater we usually frequent. After the movie, my husband could not stop talking about the movie itself and the overall experience of seeing it in this type of theater. We decided at that moment that we would not wish to see a movie anywhere else, ever again.  The weekend was perfect and I know that my husband had a very memorable birthday this year!",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX75HES,3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX75HES
