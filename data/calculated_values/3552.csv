It was something that I felt like I needed in such a long time. We make all type of plans and they never seem to come togehter. This one was different. This one had all the ingredients for success. It was well thought out. I was surprised by the amount of love that was encamped around me. I can say that I am so blessed to have girlfriends like them. They really value and appreciate me in ways that I never knew. This gives me the confidence to run into my desinty and into my husbands arms. It's something to be proud of to be honest.
