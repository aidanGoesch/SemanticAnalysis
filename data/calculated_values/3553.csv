It was a hot day. The shower was outside. We had a few canopies set up over the tables to provide shade. We also had some large fans pointed at the tables. There was a taco bar, drinks, and three games with prizes. First, the guests ate. Then we played the games. After the games there was time for mingling and socializing among the guests. At the very end of the shower, the bride opened gifts. When the bride was opening gifts she opened a ""joke"" gift, but she did not realize it at the time. Only a few guests were in on the joke. A few hours after the shower, we got ready for the bachelorette party and attended that that evening. The bachelorette party was outside as well. We went out to eat. We also went to a few bars.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX7LEH5,
