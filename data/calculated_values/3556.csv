I was working from home that day. I remember being especially happy that day because I was able to get some errands done in between my work demands, and felt a good sense of work and life balance that day. I remember being thankful for my position and that I was allowed to be flexible with my work schedule.  I received an email about 11:45am that was somewhat cryptic. The essence of the email was that something was coming soon, but don't worry, you still have a position here in the company. I recall being confused. At 12pm we had a company-wide conference call. We were told that in 30 days, we would no longer have an office as our contract had been canceled. This came as a complete shock to everyone, as just the week before we were on another conference call where we were assured that everything was peachy keen, the company was doing very well and we had nothing to worry about.  I remember feeling like someone punched me in the stomach, I was worried for myself and my 90 or so co-workers in the office that would not have a job in 30 days.  The email that I received earlier made more sense now.  I was told that I was one of the few employees that was being kept on, for now, and would work strictly remote for other contracts in the company.  I recall being relieved, worried, nervous, and scared all at the same time. It was a strange feeling.  I wasn't sure what to expect, as we were all told just a week prior that everything was fine. I was sure that my position was not just fine.  I was not expected to have any work duties for 3 months, but they were going to pay me my regular salary. How long can I expect to be kept as an employee with no work to do?",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNR0LTLNO
