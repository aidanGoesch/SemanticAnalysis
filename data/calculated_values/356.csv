He really enjoys the independance of living on his own and making decisions for himself.  Recently, I have had to have very stern conversations with him regarding his spending habits and budget.  He has not been very disciplined when it comes to spending money, and as a results is over his bduget for the year.  The significance is this threatens his ability to do certain activities like trips to other countries in the future.  He is eating into his ""travel money"" for trivial expenses like fast food and drinks at a local bar. I don't enjoy lecturing him about this, but I feel I have to step in before this becomes a bigger problem.  I want him to embrace the fact he is able to live his own life.  However, if he cannot make mature decisions, and those decisions could impact the rest of his time overseas, I must act. He has been reluctant to discuss the problem and seems more interested in just ignoring the situation (and me).  He tells me he is aware of what is happening and willing to accept the consequences and act accordingly.  I think this is just him telling me what he thinks I want to hear.  I also do not think he truly understands the impact of being in a foreign country with little to no money if he exhausts his savings. Even though my getting involved is putting a damper on his enjoyment in the near tem, I expect in the long run he will be happy.  Once he is able to see the bigger picture of what saving (vs. spending) allows him to do, I believe he will be thankful he changed his spending habits.",32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WTC7M9H,
