It was intimidating to be chosen for this opportunity but I felt ready.  I have been with the company for twelve years but this was still a shock.  I spent some time reviewing numbers and practices my answers.  I felt the interview went well and I was excited.  When I got the call I still remember being on my bed and I could not smiling.  The other scary part was moving.  I went away to collage but I lived in the same city I grew up in.  I do not know anyone in the new city and would be away from family.  There was also a time crunch.  I would need to move out of my current house and get a new one within 2 weeks.  I did not have time to visit the city before I moved and found an apartment online.  I looked online and asked a few co-workers that live in the city but it was still a nervous process.  What I decided on was close to work but still in a safe neighborhood.  The process was fast and made me nervous put I was glad it happened.  I looked at the process as a challenge but also a reward for my hard work.  I am currently still in the position and live in the new city, which means I think about it all the time.  Sometimes I think about what it would be like if I stayed but I try not to go that way.",3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRZJINLA,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRZJINLA
