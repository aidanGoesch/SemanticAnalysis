It took a while to find a great place for him. We finally found a nice arcade and pizza place. The pizza was great. I had a large meat lover's and shared it with the family. They enjoyed it as well. There were many games in the arcade. I played some Ski ball. I let my son when and he had a lot of fun. I played some classics, like Pac-man. I let the little one beat me in Pac-man but just barely. He got a 1000 points more than me. The arcade wasn't that full. We had this party by ourselves. We all went home with a smile on our faces and will remember this forever.",,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXT4PJI36
