So we started watching videos on YouTube. We wanted to keep it a surprise so we tried to come up with a clever way to find out what he likes. So we had him watch the videos with us of different places we could go to. My initial idea was a theme park but on one hand he was still a bit too young to ride most of the rides. Regardless we played him videos of theme parks that are available in Florida. In the middle of us watching a random ad popped up. It turned out it was a video for Chuck E Cheese. He was really excited watching that video so we had our idea. On the day of his birthday after opening some presents we all got into the car. He had absolutely no idea where we were going. We brought his tablet so he had some of his shows to watch because the drive was a little far. When we got there he was so exited! Seeing his face light up was so worth it. Thinking back on this today I feel like we made the right choice. We can do theme parks when he is a bit older. We ended up with some great pictures as well. He passed out right away when we were finished. It really was an awesome birthday for him.,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXT4PJI36,
