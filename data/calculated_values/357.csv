That was what I thought to myself as I left the airport last week.  Those thoughts brought on a wave of emotions, both good and bad. My son, who has been a daily part of my life for the past 18 years, was going away.  My wife and I would not seen him again for about nine months.  We always knew when he graduated from high school that he would likely be leaving the state for college.   That expectation took on a new twist when he was accepted at a school that had a program allowing freshman student to apply to spend their entire first college year studying in Italy.  He was thrilled when he was accepted in to the program, and I was happy and proud.  However I was also nervous and sad. While I am exicted for him and the opportuniy he has in front of him over the next year, it still hurts to think of him being so far away.  The idea of ""losing"" someone I am used to seeing every day, that I won't be able to help him if he gets sick or hurt, hat we won't be able to take a walk together, or throw a ball, or share a soda, or just talk... leaves me with an empty feeling inside.  Sure we will text and email, and (hopefully) speak on the phone several times each week, but it is not the same. Should I feel guilty over being sad instead of happy for him?  In truth, I feel both.  I am proud to see him take another step towards growing up and becoming his own man... but I also miss my little boy.",32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WTC7M9H,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WTC7M9H
