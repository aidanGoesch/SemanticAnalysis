My mom's boyfriend promised her that he could get her a new job in the next state over.  We packed up everything and found a new apartment and got me enrolled in a new school.  Once we got there and were settled my mom's boyfriend suddenly got very busy.  He stopped answering calls and was evasive.  I could see what was coming but my mom was slower to realize it.  Sure enough, there was no new job and we were quickly running out of fund.  I got an after school job and my mom took a temp job at the bank.  I liked out new town and home but worried we wouldn't be able to afford to stay. Then, a miracle happened!  My mom was talking to a bank customer about how we came to town and she was offered a new job.  It paid better and let her  get back into her chosen field.  So now we can stay in town permanently.  I am so happy things worked out this time but i hope my mom has a better radar for idiot boyfriends in the future.  I hate knowing my life can be upended so easily.",,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTBHVI39
