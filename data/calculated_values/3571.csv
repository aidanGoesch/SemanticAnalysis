I was fortunate enough to be able to stay at my boyfriends house and get a few online jobs. I also was able to get in contact with my real dad who is currently moving back to Dallas to buy a house so he can help me get my life back together. I haven't seen my mom in about 5 months, I refuse to, she make my skin itch and I don't wanna be around her anymore. My mom's boyfriend and her are staying at my grandmas house full time with my little sister and niece. He also refuses to get a job because he says his money is still coming and it's any day now. Now no one in my family likes him except my mom, he thought he would reach out and bother me everyday with long text messages and phone calls every 10 minutes. Him and my mom also tried to convince me not to go live with my real dad and that they can offer me a better life. They are both so high up the others butt it's sad, but not sad enough for me to go see them. My life took a turn back in October, i went clubbing with my best friend and was drinking and dancing the night away. The next day I woke up and felt a real sharp pain in my leg and a liquid leaving my body, turns out I had been pregnant and was having a miscarriage. I went through that for about a week and was really low in my life, I had realized that I really had nothing to call my own. I didn't tell anyone but my best friend and my boyfriend, I couldn't bare to tell anyone in my family, I just couldn't bare it. I still talk to my mom on the phone from time to time and she wants to talk to me in person about her boyfriend and whether I like him or not. This is one of the reason I refuse to see her, she only cares about him and me being away from my dad, another reason is her constant lies she's been telling that have come out. I don't wanna get into exactly what she lied about, but I hate liars and it was enough for me to look at her differently. The only upside is that my relationship is stronger than ever, we're actually thinking about building a tiny house and travelling the USA. He wants to get married but I want to wait a few more years after we get our degrees.",3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTBHVI39,
