We were planning on saving up our money until July and just go to school full time. So one day I come home from work and my mother tells me that her and her long  time boyfriend will be getting married so there's no need for me to work anymore and that we would be moving houses as well. So I told my boss I was going to put in a three week notice in so I can just focus on school from now on. When it came time to move my moms boyfriend had no money, absolute nothing to his name. So my mom quit her job and had to pay for everything for the move we didnt even have a moving truck so my boyfriend offered to let us use his grandpas truck . So we moved all of our stuff out of our home and put it in storage. My mom then told us to bring clothes enough for three days cause well be staying in an airbnb until his so called money came through. So three days had passed and his money still wasn't around so we had to go to another airbnb this happened for five weeks. We hoped around to different airbnb's, not to mentioned no one in my family has a car so we had to depend on me and my sisters boyfriends. So June 13th came around and this happens to be my nieces birthday we had planned to order her a cake from a place on Ubereats, because at this point no one in my family had any money at all, so we had to use my Venmo account to get food every night to eat. So my moms boyfriend messed up the dates we were suppose to be there, so the maid came and told us we had to leave, because another tenant was coming. So we had to hurry up and get our stuff and leave, thank god my boyfriend was off and decided to spend the night, the night before. So we leave and went to a coffee shop so we could figure out our next move, we ended up sitting there for over three hours, so me and my boyfriend went to his house and told them to call us when they had a place. They never found a place and I've been at my boyfriends house every since, my mom and her boyfriend are homeless and having been sleeping at the hospital with my grandma and sometimes hop from house to house with my moms friends. If this wasn't enough my mom still has no money and we lost everything we owned in our storage unit, I had the most belongings in there because I'm kind of a shopaholoic, so I was devastated. I had work so hard at my old job for everything I had and for it to be gone in the blink of an eye really depressed me.  I am now trying to save up money to get my own place and get as far away from my mom and her bummy boyfriend. Lastly I just find that it's so crazy how one person can come in your life and completely change everything you were so use to, also I almost forgot I wont be able to attend school this fall, my mom didnt even fill out the Fasfa form I told her to so I really quit my job for nothing.",3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTBHVI39,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTBHVI39
