Its been 5 months already since my internship. I really miss working there. There was so many great people and alot of perks. It really is a great job. I'm just worried that there might be a better job that I'm missing out on. I don't think I'd ever get tired of the work there on one hand but it's the first real career I've been offered. My boss Bruce definitely kept things exciting. I didnt know what to expect when I first started. The actual work was better to do than I had imagined. There was such a great sense of community. They welcomed me though and made me feel like I belonged. I still have to make it to graduation before I can start. The more I think about it the more I want to go back. I guess we'll see if that changes.,,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTE0I3IM
