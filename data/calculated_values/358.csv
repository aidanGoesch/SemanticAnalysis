I am not sure what exactly caused him to pick up the habit but I do know he had a rough childhood. One day I walked into the garage and saw that he had completely rearranged it and I noticed a small glass pipe on one of the tables. I had never seen this type of pipe before but I did notice the residue built up inside. I confronted him about this and he admitted that he had smoked some earlier in the day and started cleaning up the garage. I asked him how long he had been using and he said he started recently. I had noticed some changes in his behavior recently. He started to stay up later and later at night. At times I would wake up in the morning and he was still awake. I thought he was stressed out because of work or that he needed to catch up on an assignment but I did not think much of it. Once he admitted to smoking meth I told him he needed to get help. This is a slippery slope and I didn't want it to get to an extreme point. This was 5 years ago. He went to rehab for a few months and everything seemed fine. He came back and attended some NA meetings and met some people that could help him out with his problems. Then he started acting odd again. He came home at odd hours of the night and when I confronted him, he became very defensive and refused to answer my questions. Then the arrest came. As a result of him going to rehab he lost his job. I had to pick up two shifts in order to make ends meet. When he came back he had a hard time holding a job. He bounced around from job to job until he met up with some people at NA who set him up with a decent job at a local fast food restaurant. He had been working there for 3 years and then he had the bright idea of stealing some money from the register to feed his habit. Three months ago, the manager confronted him about this, and he was arrested that very same day. I love him with all my heart but I can't stay with him if he relapses again, because next time I don't know what he will do.",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WV3EM98
