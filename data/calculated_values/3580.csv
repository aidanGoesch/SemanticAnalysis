I interned with PricewaterhouseCoopers in Minneapolis, MN for three months. I worked on an audit for the first three weeks of the internship. For the last two months, I was then stationed with the International Tax group. During my internship, I was exposed to many different things. Many of the things that I worked on during the duration of my internship I had never seen before. While this made it difficult, as I had to absorb everything quickly, I was able to learn a lot. There wasn't one day that was the same as another. I was constantly working on different projects. There would be some days where I would have three or four projects to work on. I sat in on many phone calls with foreign teams and had my fair share of meetings. Everyone I worked with was very helpful, including the partners. I really appreciated my time there. At the end of my internship, I was extended a full time offer. I will start back with the firm in the summer of 2021.",3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTE0I3IM,
