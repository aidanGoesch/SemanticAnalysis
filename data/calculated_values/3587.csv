He was stopping by to see how everything was going and if the business was thriving. After being assured, my father invited him into the house for a glass of gin. He kept looking at me standing off in the corner watching as they chatted with each other. He asked my father if he would like to make another transaction and my father said ""yes"". He went on to talk about what a pretty girl I am and how he would like to make me a concubine in his harem. I did not know what he meant. I am only 14 and have not seen much of the world. I have been protected by my family and not aware of the customs of our country.  After much negotiation back and forth concerning my worth, they reached an agreement. I was nothing more than a slab of meat in the window of the shop waiting to be purchased.  I was then commanded to pack my belongings for the trip to his home. Of course, my mother was upset but she told me to be brave.  She said I would learn to love him in time but I had my doubts. This is the custom in my country and women have no rights or say so in what happens to them. With a sadness and fear in my heart, I packed my bag and went with him to my new home.",,3KB8R4ZV1FTDDZ90FVLH60IPNFUBGK
