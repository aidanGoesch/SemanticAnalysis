We fight all the time and as much as I try, I can't make him happy or help him with his anger.  He has returned to meth one time since he's been out and it was terrible to watch.  He had full-on delusions and wanted to argue you with me over scientific principles that were non-existent.  He claimed that all plants have psychedelic properties and that he could make DMT out of the mimosa trees that grow near our house.  I found him passed out at the base of a poor tree that had been hacked halfway out of the ground with a garden trowel.  He seems to be doing better and has gotten into an outpatient treatment program in the last week.   I fear he has some psychological issues that need medication, but I dare not say anything about it to him.  Luckily, I work from home and can monitor him while he's here.  I moved after his arrest to a more rural area to avoid the drug culture that our old neighborhood was immersed in.  As for myself, I have no desire to use drugs, other than maybe some pot now and then to relax.  I feel like there are so many other people that suffer from addiction and there are no real resources to help them, save meetings and for-profit rehabs.  I have started a non-profit application so that people might be able to get to meetings and appointments.  It seems that people on drugs have no transportation to get to the help that they so desperately need.  Watching the man that I love devolve into an angry crazy caricature is heartbreaking to say the least.  He was a beautiful, intelligent, thoughtful, playful, poetic soul when I married him and drugs have taken that man away and left me with a shell.  I hope and pray that he can come back to his former self and I will use all my resources to make that happen.",32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WV3EM98,
