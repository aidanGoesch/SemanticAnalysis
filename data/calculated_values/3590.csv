It was a regular day and I decided to go to the zoo with my  kids. I was planning this trip for about a month now. My children were really exited to go to the zoo and observe the animals. My kids love being in nature. So we all packed up and we were on our way there in no time. It took us 30 minutes to get there and it was an easy ride. When I got there I parked my car in the zoo's parking lot. I bought the tickets and we all went inside the zoo. To my surprise, I met my friend with his kids at the zoo. I was exited to see him there with the children. We all joined each other and were exploring the place together. We walked around the whole zoo back and forth. Then we saw a sprinkler right next to the playground area and we all decided to go and play in the water. Our kids had super fun. They enjoyed themselves a lot and they had a great playtime. After that we had some snacks and watch animals for like another hour or so before we all decided to leave. It was an awesome day to remember.",,3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2HB2UO
