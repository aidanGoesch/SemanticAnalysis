When we got there we went to go look at the tigers and the orangutan. My kids loved seeing them and also seeing some monkey too. We went with a friend and she had her kid on a leash, but he didn’t want to sit in that so we switched. My daughter went on the leash instead and she enjoyed it. So then we went to see my favorite animals-red pandas. They used to have a branch that extended over the walkway, but they got rid of it because one escaped. Once we finished there we went to eat lunch. My kids had sandwiches and I had an awesome burger. We decided to get the kids dressed in their swimsuits to go to the splash pad. We went to look at the tortoises, and then let the kids run to the splash pad. There was a field trip and a lot of older kids so I was worried about ours since there were 2 toddlers. Thankfully they were nice to our kids. My daughter didn’t want to go in the water but my son and my friends son went in. She did get wet a little, and my son went crazy. Afterwards we went out separate ways and went home.",3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2HB2UO,3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2HB2UO
