As I drove home I was able to contemplate what I had just done and what I was returning home to.  For the previous month we were busy getting ready for ""school"",doing all the things we wanted to do together before they spread their wings and took off for their next adventure in life.  It was a busy and emotional time for all of us.  As we left it was surprising to see my son being emotional and not wanting to let go of his hug. I was very touched by this and tried not to cry.  Our daughter on the other hand was off and running and could'nt get rid of us fast enough. I returned to a quiet house with the dogs wondering where everyone had gone.  It was now just me and my husband.  We will now be able to do what we want to do for dinner and sit where we want to watch what we want on the big screen TV.  I am not so sure I like it.  I will miss the noise and excitement of the kids coming and going.  The past month was busy and fun and now I will be walking into a dull lifeless house. The refrigerator will now be full and no piles of laundry in front of the laundry room door. It will be different.",3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2IHU2O,3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2IHU2O
