It can be fun to get out of our comfort zone in a brand new activity. However, starting with one we already know and love will give. Make a quick list of the activities we are most comfortable with. Need some good ideas first. Take a look at our list of fun ways to meet new friends in a new city as well as ways to meet friends online. Personally I love the immersion dating nature of the show, not to mention how addictive it is to watch, and think we should all try it at some point. It is viscerally impossible not to like someone who genuinely smiles at you. This means smiling with our entire face, including our eyes. Try this as to greet friends and colleagues and observe their reaction. A smile will disarm defenses, boost your likability and increase the chances of a positive conversation before you say a word. Every time smile makes us start a good relationship. At last had a good partner. It’s time to get super clear on what you love to do. Because when you pursue hobbies and activities you enjoy, you have a good chance of meeting people with similar interests. When you’re just starting to get to know someone, foster intimacy by talking about something deeper than the suck weather. Gradually disclose something meaningful about yourself and see if your new friend will do the same. While not everyone has the courage to do it, most of us know how to pursue a crush. Swipe right. Send flowers to their office. Invite them to a concert of a band you know they’ll love. Ask them to check yes or no under the question Will you go out with me? on lined paper. Apply similar tactics when pursuing a potential friend. For example, send the person an email asking them to lunch or coffee next week, and follow up afterward to say you had a good time and mention something specific that was funny or memorable.",,3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1W9KOH
