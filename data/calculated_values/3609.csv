I had just graduated high school and had a party for this celebration. My brother was acting lazier than usual and was just down right slow. I remember giving him crap left and right and saying how mad I was. A week later I got the call. He was sick and had cancer they told us. I remember still hearing those words and felt so crappy about it. I wish I could go back and take the words back on what I said. Things were wrong between us. I couldn't look him in the eyes anymore. I felt so crappy and still remember those feelings. I would go and visit him and think how crappy I was to him. He would apologize for this and I would apologize and cry to him. This went on and on and finally I was able to save his life with my bone marrow. I really felt better at that point. Now years have passed and I am thankful for this.,,3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAHAPLOKS
