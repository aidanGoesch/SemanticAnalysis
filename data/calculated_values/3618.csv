I fear that if I don't write it down soon I may not believe it myself in another 1/4 of a year. As you might know, there are no leash laws in my community. The neighborhood dogs tend to spend the days visiting each other and ... being dogs. Most of them go back to the particular human family that ""owns them"" at night to be fed and cared for, but there are always a few that don't seem to belong to anyone in particular and just sort of make the rounds between a few different homes. Well, my wife stumbled on a post on facebook that a local stray who we had always called Rufus had been taken into the pound by animal control. He had been found under a nearby house when the homeowners investigated the source of a whimpering noise they had been hearing for a few days. Apparently there was a thorn in his foot that had become badly infected, and these people (not having money for veterinary care, nor desiring to have a dog) had him taken to the shelter. Well, I had always been rather fond of Rufus in passing. So when my wife suggested we cover the cost of his antibiotics and adopt him I agreed. A couple weeks of healing and good food and he was back to his rascally good nature. However, now that we ""owned"" him on paper problems began to arise. You see, my wife and I live on the edge of town and coyotes live in the valley below us. They don't really cause any trouble in town, but they are the reason that most farmers in the area have a dog to scare them away from livestock. It used to be that when the coyotes would start ""singing"" at night several of the town dogs would ""rap battle"" right back. A territory thing I suppose ... Well, Rufus in particular had always seemed to see it as part of his oikos to protect the smaller dogs and bark loudly to keep the coyotes at bay. Nobody ever seemed to mind, but once he became ""our"" dog that changed. Neighbors began to call the police with noise complaints. They demanded that we keep him in the house at night. Now, he was a very sweet dog, obedient to many commands like sit, shake, Eskimo Kiss, etc. but being rather a free spirit the one thing he would not do is come when he was called. He would come close enough to ""check in"" but not quite into arms reach until he was good and ready. Well, after a few more exchanges with the cops we started keeping him tied up with a cable when he went out so we could make sure that he came inside at night. Well, one night the local pack of coyotes were raising a right ruckus. Long story short, Rufus broke the cable and ran off to join them, I have been hearing his deep happy bark mingling with their song from the valley.",,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4CRTAVJU
