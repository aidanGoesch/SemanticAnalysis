It was a big decision in my life and the hardest one I ever had to make. I lived in a small European country, Montenegro, for 30 years of my life. I was happy in Montenegro but I started feeling that I am unable to advance too much in my professional life. My main focus was to get hired for a big company where I can learn more about web design and building websites for the clients because I have a Bachelor degree in this field. So, I finally decided to move and live in the USA where my husband used to live for the last 10 years. My husband was so excited that he will not have to fly 2-3 times a year to Montenegro just to spend time with me. When I come to Michigan it was very cold and snowy. Nothing like beautiful Mediterranean weather I am used to. I felt some uncomfortableness around my heart and thought that I might never get used on this coldness. I took my laptop and checked which company are hiring web designers. So, in the next 2-3 days, I built my resume and I applied for 3 companies I found most attractive. One of them was MPH Marketing Solutions company and one week after the application they called me for the interview. I was so excited. My interview went very well and they hired me. They showed me the office and introduced me to other workers. It was a small size company, very clean and organized. Workers with different racial and cultural background were very welcoming and I felt positive about my start. On the other hand, I missed my family and friends a lot. I talked with them every day using Viber, Skype, FB messenger but it was not enough. I would dream of my hometown and when I would wake up I felt sad and lonely. I missed my father who was suffering from Alzheimer and I was afraid he will not recognize me when I go back visit. I tried to be busy all day just not to think. So, two days ago I booked an airplane ticket for me and my husband and this spring we will visit my hometown, Podgorica. I am full of expectations and looking forward to seeing my friend and family.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI138SRFKS
