I mean I enjoy the job that I moved out here for it just seems like there isn’t enough room for advancement. So to be honest I don’t know what to do anymore. Recently I’ve been talking with my family on skype and they tell me to come home. I know they mean well, but I wish they could just come here instead. They told me I was crazy for doing what I did, and maybe they are right. But the craziest thing are usually the best things too! At least I hope they are, especially I. This case. I feel like giving up, like crying. I don’t know why this always happens to me, but I think I’m going to try and take some leave to clear my head. I want to see my family again and just get this weight and pressure to succeed off my back. In the end I guess I would be happy either way. To be honest as long as I keep my smile and my love for myself and my family in mind I know I will do great things in my life. I I just have to keep believing, and never stop.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI138SRFKS
