I was apprehensive about what the future held but I knew that this needed to happen in order for me to grow. It took me a while to go through my belongs and sort out what I had room to take with me and what I needed to part with. This was an emotional process in and of itself. I had lived in one place so long I had acquired many sentimental items and memories. To go through them all and decide what I had room to take with me was somewhat painful. Once I was through this process I packed up my moving van and headed out. The journey took about 12 hours and I finally in my new home. It was exciting to see new places, try new restaurants, meet new people. I feel that this process helped me learn more about myself and see things from a different perspective. I have learned from the diverse set of people in this metropolitan area and what their backgrounds are. I am now enrolled in a masters program and have a new job. Things are done differently here and cultural values are different than where I come from but I feel happy. I miss my family here but I plan to visit often and I hope they come to visit me as well. I think this process will move my career farther ahead than staying at home and I think if I am to return I will understand the way others do things. I am happy to have embarked on this new journey.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI138SRFKS
