It was very emotional for me, as being a woman anyone would understand. But I know the result from having it done was much better for me. It's so much better for my health because of the diseases I had. I won't suffer anymore as I used to. The surgery itself was tough, but after recovery I will feel much better. I'm sad in some ways that this ended up happening, but I'm glad I found a doctor who was able to help me. Life can still go on and I will bounce back from this. I am grateful I was able to finally come to a resolution with my health and move on. I can look forward to being out of pain and suffering now. In the long run, quality of life is what is most important so I can enjoy my days. I know this won't make me any less of a woman. I've always been scared of surgery, but I got through it! I am a strong woman. This is just another reminder of my strength.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI13IT0KFI
