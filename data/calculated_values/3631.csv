The car we got was not what I expected. We got a Doge super charger that was fast and loud. I was excited but my wife was scared of the car. I let her drive it to cracker barrel for breakfast so she would not be scared. We went to Pigeon Forge Tennessee for a long weekend trip. The car made us feel young again. Driving through the mountains on tight curved was exhilarating going so fast.  It was Christmas time so we went to Dollywood to see the lights. At night it ts so beautiful with all that is going on. We stayed up until when they closed which is highly unusual for us since we usually go to bed around 8 pm. We even had a late dinner at the resort we stayed at nd had a beautiful room that over looked the valley. Staying up into the wee hours of the morning was like we where 20 years old again. We got up around 12 and that has never happened since we where first married. We had a brunch and went to the theme park again for the day/ We rode on rides that we never thought we would go on again and it was thrilling. We then had a gourmet meal at a high end restaurant and where surprised again that our children had payed for our meal way back when we where on our beach trip. The weekend ended with a nice drive through the smokie mountain national park with stops along the way in little towns to pick up unusual things to remember our trip by.,3KOPY89HM9OI16VO88RELUCTOXFJ3J,
