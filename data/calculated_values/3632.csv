My children rented a house on the outer banks. My children and grand children came. There was ten of us. We spent 7 glorious days together as a family. One of my daughters and her family live in the same town as us. My other daughter lives in Colorado and flew here to be with us. We went to the beach , ate at some fine restaurants and had a lot of talks together as a family.. As I like to cook I made breakfast every day and enjoyed it. We went sailing and visited some historical sites. I surprised my wife with an ounce of gold for our anniversary. the  outer banks is about 7 hours fron where we live abd a world apart from the real world. We drove there and picked up my daughter in Ralieh and then we met our other daughter at the house. I enjoyed getting up in the morning and watching the sun come up over the horizon. The last night we where there we had a big fish dinner. My son in laws went to a great seafood place and picked up all the fish we needed to have a big fish dinner. The kids surprised us with a big anniversary cake that they bought at a local bakery.",3KOPY89HM9OI16VO88RELUCTOXFJ3J,
