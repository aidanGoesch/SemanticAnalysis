In fact I would say that it was the hardest decision I had to make in my life. I had so many doubts about my ability to love and and care for a child that I didn't help make. I wasn't sure if I was that kind of person. Me and my wife were trying to have a child for the past five years with no luck. She would get pregnant but she would have a miscarriage within 5 months. This happened a number of times. My wife as more relectant than me to adopt a child. At first we didn't even talk about adoption but her mother said something to us about it and we looked into it. We were both doubtful but with more research we began to feel better. Our confidence grew and we thought to ourselves maybe we can do this. We still weren't sure but we were moving along with the process. What made us really consider the situation was hearing stories from other people. Parents who adopted children felt just like us. They didn't know if they could truly love a child that wasn't theirs. But in the end they found out that they could love another child. And that was a major reason why we began the adoption process.,,3KOPY89HM9OI16VO88RELUCTPR0J3T
