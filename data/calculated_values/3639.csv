She needed extra care that she couldn't provide for herself. Her hematologist-oncologist ordered her to have an MRI of the brain after we noticed speech abnormalities. The MRI came back with no evidence of stroke, cancer or any other thing other than a mild sinus infection and some slight thickening in the brain lining. We continued to be very discouraged as she lost more and more of her ability to speak. She also became more confused and needed help dressing. It was up to me to help her with all of these simple things that she used to be able to do for herself. We had some difficult days. Soon, my sister and I took her in for a lumbar puncture to see if any evidence of her leukemia would show up in her central nervous system (CNS) fluids. It did not, but then they weren't able to get a full sample and said the test results were negative but also somewhat inconclusive. We were frustrated and baffled. The local neurologists were all booked up and weren't able to see her immediately. Finally, after trying to contact more doctors we took her back in to the ER, one month after her initial brain MRI. This new MRI showed that she did indeed have a diffuse cancer in her brain, and moreso on the left side, though it was evident on both the left and right. It had grown very fast. CLL rarely spreads to the brain, but my Mom was an exception. Now we had an answer but what to do next? As the doctors laid out what sort of treatments, all chemo, could be provided and the possible side effects, and contrasted that against the fact that no treatment would cure her and only possibly extend her life by a few weeks, if that, we decided against any further treatment. We brought my mom back to my home at the end of July, straight from the hospital and hospice met us at the house to sign her up for home treatment. The treatment basically to consist of palliative care until she dies of natural causes. I am under a great deal of stress but am holding up well. My sister, brother and father are all as supportive as they can be and visit quite often. It is tough for my 80 year old father to see his 74 year old wife decline in this manner. At the same time we are sharing many past memories, laughter and tears. I am thankful I've had this chance to care for my Mom at the end of her life and won't forget it.",3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMCHAMSV,
