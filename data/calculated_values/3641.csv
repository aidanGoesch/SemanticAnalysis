I moved to live closer to my in laws. I also liked the idea of living in a bigger city, which they do. I was not happy where I lived before. There was little shopping and not much employment opportunity. It was very exciting to come to a new state. It is a warmer climate than what I was used to so. I hope I get used to the heat. Most people that have lived here a while seem to do ok in the heat. I thought it was funny that I needed to use different and new make up and hair products here. The things I used to use just don't work so well here. It has been very energizing for me to be somewhere new. I enjoy going out in the evenings and visiting new places. I have met some people that live nearby and they seem very nice. I have been helpful to my inlaws who really needed some extra help around the house.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMERDMSK
