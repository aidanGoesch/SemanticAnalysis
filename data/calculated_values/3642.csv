We find the house and learn about custom here we very love here so far. Everything here is very different from where we used to be. Here are all the mountains, forests, live things, everything is green and we like it very much. Here they know how to enjoy their lives. They love sailing, they like camping, they don't like staying at home, they like traveling together and looking at beautiful wings and enjoying new dishes and new tastes. Every morning I see them walking together with their pets and often having a cup of coffee. They take their children to play places. Here but the small house and they decorated very cute and good-looking. They plant trees and flowers throughout their gardens. Everyone here is very happy they like to talk to each other when they meet anyone on the road. Here the trees are very big and very high. There are big rivers. There are very beautiful parks for children. There are tall buildings. Here the traffic is very pleasant to go on a trip. Here they enjoyed walking together. There are shops that sell very good food and look very cute. There are great shopping areas. I really like the libraries here that have so many different things that I have never seen before. I was very proud that I found a great place. We are going to learn and learn where each code comes from.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMERDMSK
