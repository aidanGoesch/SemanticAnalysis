I've been setting a lot of wagers over the last few months and have been facing a ton of losses. I can't believe I did this to myself. I even promised myself that I would only be a spectator at the French Open. How am I going to recover the funds that I lost? I know I have an addiction and I think it's time I get some help for it. I'm never going to save enough money to buy a new car or a new house if I keep doing this. I might have to stop going to these events. I seem to be tempted just being in a situation where I can make a bet. At least if I'm at home, I can't be as tempted. I wonder if I can find someone to talk to. I really want to start saving money instead and I am not helping myself in any way. I'll have to look for more work in order to get some more income. I just can't be tempted to bet that money too. So here's me saying it right now. I need help. I don't know where and how I'll get it yet, but I'm starting with step one and saying that I need help controlling my temptations and setting up long-term financial stability.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMFKXSMX
