But lo and behold, we got to do a milwaukee comicon. We had some big names enroll to speak, like some game of thrones cast, a couple marvel writers, and a local carnival offered rides. When day of the event came it was abysmal. We had way more people come than expected, and a lot of them didnt tickets. The rides didnt all have operators so the operators were switching between rides to make them run. 2 of the guests cancelled so our panels suffered. The restaurant that catered the event also ran out of bread so sandwhiches were off the table which many people were requesting. There were no written agreements as the organizers did everything on the phone. It was a mess and all around a bad time. I think people should just stick to san diego comicon. It wasnt all bad though. The guests who did show up were engaging. The vendors had some really cool booths, and a lot of good cosplay was had. It turned into a so bad its good type of situation. At least part of it was able to be salvaged.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMMNFMSM
