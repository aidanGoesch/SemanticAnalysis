How I got injured, is pretty annoying and embarrassing. See, I was doing my Crossfit workout of the day, and assumed I was doing one of the exercises correctly. Well, I didn't do it correctly, and pulled a nasty muscle in my back. I was so alarmed by the pain and by the limited mobility I had, that my wife drug me to the hospital to get it looked at. They pretty much said time and rest will mend it, and not to overdue it. That was it. I wasn't expecting anything else, but my wife was just so concerned, that I'm glad we got it checked out anyways. At first I was alright with knowing that I would be on rest for a little while, in terms of doing strenuous things. Then the annoyance escalated at not being able to reach a glass high up in the cupboard. How laying down on the bed was painful because of the muscles I had to use to do it. Not being able to do my daily work outs was a drag, too. I was embarrassed with telling people that I did this to myself by not properly executing an exercise, but my wife just rolls her eyes and tells me that crap happens, and that I just need to get better. This took almost a month to heal completely. Afterwards, I make sure that I don't mess around during exercising, and to make sure my form is perfect. I do not want to deal with that mess again.",,3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7Q1N8RMK
