I had a small break from my daily activities but it was not enough, at least it felt like that to me. I was immersed again in my routine while I was still recovering. The pain and functional limitation was the worst for sure. I was used to do almost everything, at home or at work. Naturally when I was faced to a smaller range of action and duties I did not feel like myself. The first days were like a period where I was learning how to cope with the current situation. Then after a few days after this initial period I started to slowly learn how to perform acording to my current possibilities. My coworker and family were a huge support during this time too. I did not expect them to be that helpful because I never imagined myself in this kind of situation. It was a relief for sure and a good experience when I think about it from this perspective. It is looking the brigh side, and that is what my granpa used to remind me. It is a solid way to approach any situation. Also, learning to adapt to this kind of accidental situations it is a interesting way to measure our flexibility. Even in the worst scenarios we can grow stronger.",3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7Q1N8RMK,
