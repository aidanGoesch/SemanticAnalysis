My truck rolled over an embankment. It rolled twice and hit a tree. The truck was crushed except for a small section of the driver's side, where I was. I got a broken ankle and some bruises from the seat belt. That is all. I was in the hospital for four days, mainly because I had surgery on my ankle. Afterwards I focused on physical recovery, then physical therapy. When I began driving again I noticed that I would become anxious when I looked at the edge of the road. I also was having some bad dreams about what happened. When it began to affect my mood and sleep, I went to see a therapist.  We usually talk. Sometimes we do EMDR. EMDR helps me process the accident without having to fully relive it. Therapy is helping and the dreams and anxiety have lessened.",3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7QSOPRMU,
