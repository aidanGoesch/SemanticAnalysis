I had it scheduled for Thursday at 3 pm.   I was dressed in my usually business attire.  I had on a nice pants, shirt, and tie.  Well, I was talking to a co-worker of mine and we were enjoying a nice conversation.  I told him a joke and he laughed so hard that he spilled his coffee all over my shirt right before I was about to go into my meeting.  I was pissed.  I know he did not mean it, but I was upset.  I yelled at him for a moment and then realized it was an accident.  I took a deep breath, went to the bathroom and tried to get out the stain as best I could.  I used the hairdryer to dry my shirt after I put water on it to get out the stain.  It worked a little but not much.  I walked into my meeting and decided to tackle the issue right away.  I made a joke about my shirt and what just happened.  What I remember the most is my two directors laughed their heads off so hard one of them made a big snort.  I felt much better after she laughed.  I then sat down and we talked about my work performance.  Things went great and I ended up getting the letter of confirmation and approval from my bosses that I was looking for.",,3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7QY4UMRW
