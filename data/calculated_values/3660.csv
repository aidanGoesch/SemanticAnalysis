I only think it's fair that she returns hers because she talks with more and knows more of what to get her while I'm floundering around maybe running into something that could be considered worthwhile. Then to make matters worse my mother has been getting a kick out of this because for some reason to her it's funny that we're fighting over who can give her the gift. I will give it to her though she did offer the suggestion of buying the matching massaging neck piece and then it would look coordinated at least. But I wanted to give the slippers because they are going to be used the most, and my sister has dug her heels in insisting it be her way. Ugh! I'm soooo mad about this at the moment. I mean maybe to people on the outside looking in it wouldn't seem like such a disaster but her and my sister were only a year apart mostly and they always were closer because of the age difference. To this day that hasn't changed I mean they're both on the same social media, go to the same schools, I mean they're inseparable. I don't know how to combat that bond of theirs and try to make it seem like I'm interested in that as well. I do suppose however there was the way my mother said and it would look like there was as much thought involved anyway but how do I back down from the sister? I mean it could start a whole new conflict if she wants to get her the other item, and I say I'll get it? You know I bet she doesn't even realize how lucky she is to have people fighting over what to get her? I mean I guess it's not really a big deal but it matters enough to cause all this commotion in the family. I wonder if there's anything else I could get that would be just as great? I just wanted her birthday to be special this year and I feel as though it's all blowing up in face. I mean I wonder if I'm over reacting? Maybe I should just go and get something completely different if it matters to my other sister so much.",3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N57BZ5L8,
