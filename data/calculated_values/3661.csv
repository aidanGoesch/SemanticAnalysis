I loved to wake her up early in the morning and sing her Happy Birthday before the sun had even started to peek over the horizon. 	  Being only August though the countdown for her birthday had not yet begun so my mom decided to try and beat it and get my sisters birthday shopping done early. So one Saturday morning my mom and I went to the mall to shop for my sister. We were at a store shopping for my sister when I saw a bright yellow advertising sign hanging from the ceiling which was an advertisement for Payless, that just happened to be on the opposite end of the mall from where we were. On the sign, there were the coolest slippers I had ever seen. They were massaging slippers in the shape of animals particularly the one on the sign was a pink unicorn. The slippers themselves were pink which made them even greater because that is her favorite color. As soon as I saw these breathtaking slippers I tugged on my mothers' sleeve and pointed at the sign. Without the slightest bit of interest she just merely glanced up at the sign and went back to what she was looking at, so I had kept my eye on that sign for the entire time we were in the store, not acknowledging a word my mom said to me the rest of the time. After my mother had finished and rung her gifts out I tugged on her arm to get her attention and said I had to go across the mall that I would meet her at the car. I hadn't told her what store I was going to or for what but she walked out the exit doors of the mall and I continued on my way to Payless. When I got there I looked around the store feverishly and still couldn't find the slippers I was looking for so I stopped an employee and asked her where they were. She pointed me in the direction of the far back of the store so I took off for that corner and when I got there I saw a pile of boxes with unicorn heads sticking out of them. So then I looked through the boxes for her size and when I found them I brought them up and paid for them and ran to the mall exit hoping I hadn't detained my mother in the car for too long. When I got there she had asked me what was in the bag and I showed her, she smirked and burst out laughing and offended I asked her what was so funny because I knew my sister would love them. She smiled and explained that my other sister had bought her a massaging neck warmer that was in the shape of a unicorn and was pink and she said that only sisters could pick out a perfect pair without even knowing what the other had  gotten.",3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N57BZ5L8,
