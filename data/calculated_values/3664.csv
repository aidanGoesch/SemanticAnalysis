She is still having lots of difficulties moving around. We will be seeing the doctor later today, she believes that her suffering was caused by long term affects from the c-section when she had me. It feels like I can not get a moment to myself. 10 am: Finished helping mom freshen up and helped her to bed for a nap. I finally have some time to myself! Now I am going to try to watch some TV and enjoy myself. 11 am: Woke up to a loud thud to find my mom on her bedroom floor, she tried to go to the bathroom by herself after she said she called for me several different times. I feel like the worlds worst daughter. 12 p.m: Fixed moms lunch for her, preparing to go to the doctor at two pm. 1:30 pm: Got mom dressed and headed to the doctor traffic is terribly backed up currently sitting in the middle of it as I write this. 5 pm: Made it to the doctor around three, then traffic was still terrible on the way back. We found out that the back pains not from the C-section, but they are from the Epidural. Mom will have to have to have some sort of therapy can not remember what it was called. 8 pm: Finished washing the after dinner dishes. Helped mom freshen up and got her to bed, now she is sleeping. Time to relax with some TV again and fall a sleep un interupted, I hope.",,3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N5IUEL5G
