I never had such an awful experience in my life before. I had gone to Agra for an urgent work. There were very few buses plying today as most of them had been put on election duty. I waited for two hours at the bus-stop to get into the bus. It was much crowded. I somehow managed to get some space for myself. It was really difficult to breathe. Everyone was sweating. People were pushing each other. After journey of two hours, I came out of the bus and took a sigh of relief and they will likely. Iâ€™ll never forget this journey in my life. and i will achieve more awards and more the popularity Due to the complications at birth, the doctors said that I had less chances of surviving; as I was losing my blood pressure at a faster rate. Despite all the odds, without being kept in the incubator, I made it by just clinging onto my mom and absorbing her body heat. I was not kept in the incubator; as the only available incubator in the hospital was not working. My mom had her labor pain at an unexpected time and had to get admitted in a rural hospital with less facilities.",,3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N5IUEL5G
