The day was August 14th to be exact.  My youngest child was starting kindergarten.  My baby was not a baby anymore.  I had trouble sleeping the night before.  I woke early that morning.  I did everything I could to hold back my emotions as I got him ready for the big day.  The time was finally here.  I drove him to school soaking up the last few minutes.  I had tears well up in my eyes as I walked him up to the school doors.  The most memorable part of that day was when he looked at me and smiled and told me everything would be ok.  He was comforting me.  That made my day and will be a treasured memory I will always have.  It is so hard to let go of your children and let them go out on their own.  I loved having him be by my side day after day, but now I can the pleasure of seeing what he can do on his own.  Letting go is hard but it is has to be done.",3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0BL42C,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0BL42C
