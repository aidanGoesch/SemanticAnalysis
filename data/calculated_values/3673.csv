It was great. The wedding was great. The food was great. Everything was just perfect. I can't believe I'm finally a married man now! I'm married! I want to yell it to the sky at the top of my voice. But that would be somewhat embarrassing. So I didn't do it. Anyways, it was a great wedding, and I'm sure that I will always remember it. I will be telling my children about this great wedding when they are older. The food was fantastic, even though it cost a lot to hire the cooks. But it was worth it. I just know it because the food taste so good even though it costed so much.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0LV244
