This was a memorable event because it was the first time I had driven through many of these states. This trip really got me out of my comfort zone and showed me how vast the U.S really is. It made me realize i had a pretty narrow perspective on the United States before the trip. Along the way my friends and I stopped at different attractions and restaurants. It gave me a cool new perspective on the middle of the country fly over states such as Oklahoma, Kansas, North Texas, and New Mexico. There were a ton of surprising things about the surrounding landscapes that I had never seen before. This gave me a new perspective on my day to day life that I did not have before. The total trip took just under 1 week, and is definitely something I would want to do again. I stayed at a mixture of hotels and Air BNB's, and got to see cool new things. I got to see so many cool places and new landmarks I didn't even know existed. I also met a lot of cool people along the way that had cool stories. This was the first time I had rode in a car for more than 6 hours at a time as well. Overall this was something memorable that I will never forget. Any chance I have in the future i want to do a similar trip, maybe this time in a different country.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIIICZE42T
