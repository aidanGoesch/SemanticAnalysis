I was not expecting such a great party. All the people I loved were there. I had a guest visitor and was so glad to see their face. I had not seen them for many years. I was very glad to greet them and they were so happy to see me. I brought them over to the couch and just sat and talked with them for a long time. The rest of my guests talked among themselves. It was an amazing party. I told them what I had done over the last few years. I told them how much I wanted to see them again. They told me that everyone was in on the surprise. Everyone knew she was coming to the party and no one told me. I am glad they did not. It was the best surprise imaginable. I will always remember it. I loved the party a lot. It was the best birthday ever.,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIIITRV249,
