It was a lot of fun. The most memorable event was when my brother came over. I was not expecting him. He lives in a different state and does not have a lot of money. It was a complete surprise. I was very glad to see him. We all played board games and shared stories. It was a very fun night. I got to be with people that mattered to me. Work, or distraction did not get in the way. It was a night I will always remember. There was my best friend there, my wife, my brother and two other close friends. It was an awesome time.  I will cherish it always.",3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIIITRV249,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIIITRV249
