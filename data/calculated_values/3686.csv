I wanted to visit the mountains, as it is very beautiful and peaceful. I spent time with family. It was a great trip and I enjoyed it. We had a lot of cookouts, and the neighbors came around. We played music and had a lot of games going. We would go hiking in the morning, and return in the afternoon. We loved doing this. They view from the top of the mountains was stunning. I always looked forward to that first glimpse. It was breathtaking. It was great to be with family. We will do it again. Perhaps next year. I will visit by then.",,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRE3IOD7
