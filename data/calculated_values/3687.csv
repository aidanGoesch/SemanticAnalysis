It was myself, husband and three kids. We went to South Carolina. We went to go visit my husbands family due to his aunt passing away. We were there to finish spreading her ashes. We went to many great places but the most memorable one was going to Pretty Place. The name says it all. The place is amazing. It way up in the mountains so the drive is sorta long since it's at the top. But when you walk in it's all open so you get to embrace nature all around in the center is a cross. It makes you feel at ease when here.  It sorta feels like all your problems just go away. But in the event that we were there for it was nice being with family and telling stories about his aunt. It was very emotional but at the same time it was nice to be with everyone and comfort everyone. The weather was amazing. South Carolina was a great time and I recommend everyone go and visit.",,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRE3IOD7
