I took the bus up from DC to Boston to attend. It was a long bus ride, but I took the overnight bus so was able to sleep for most of it. When I got in I was exhausted. To get ready I drank some coffee and went to the party. My cousins rented a local Italian restaurant for the party. It was a surprise and they were very shocked to see all of us there for the event. There was a lot of food. Seven courses in all. In the end I wasn't able to complete more than 5. I initially resisted having desert. But the rum cake they got for the party was so good that I was somehow able to finish two servings. I don't get to go home that often. It was nice to see my whole family together. It reminded me of the family get togethers we had when I was a child.",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRE3NODC,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRE3NODC
