This person also has the most amazing personality.  They are smart. They are funny and witty.  This person is just so amazing. We spent the whole day together. We went to some famous landmarks. We ate some good food. We talked a lot, and got to know eachother pretty well. Turns out this person likes and cares about all of the stuff I do. They care about animals and the planet just like me. They also love cars and music just like I do. We also share the same great taste in music. This person is great. I actually feel like they care about me the same way I care abot them and that is a lot.",,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRFX2DO5
