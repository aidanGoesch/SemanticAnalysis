She was so absolutely beautiful and rich in personality. Even though she was my type - I found he irresistibly attractive. She loved the music I loved. She even knew the lyrics to my favorite songs. She was perfect in so many ways. I felt like I was on cloud 99 with  her. She is one of the coolest people I've vibed with in a while. It was nice to experience a breath of fresh air. I thoroughly enjoyed her company. She is fun to be a around. We had a natural chemistry. From now moving forward, I always want the lady to be a friend above all before more can ever transpire. This has set the bar to the stars. I will expect the best and nothing less from this point forward.",,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRFX2DO5
