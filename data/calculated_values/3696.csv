What happened today had nothing to do with race or anything, any one around their could see i was engrossed and really busy on my phone. On this particular i was way behind scheduled on so many office assignments and i had to find a way to cover up.  I have been working my ass out lately at the office because i volunteered to cover up for a friend who had to go his girlfriend and Miami. their relationship was on the verge of collapse, so i had take one for the team. Unfortunately for me our boss told me a delegation from the headquarters where coming the following week, we had to put things in order and owing to the fact that my colleague travelled i had to cover up for him and at the same try and tidy up files for both of us. This  wasn't what i expected but lo and behold it is happening. So after a very stressful morning i went for a lunch break as didn't have breakfast that day, made and order for some food which i can't even remember presently and I was trying to get some things done on my phone before while my order was been prepared. I looked and saw a Mexican looking man in a green shirt in front of me, went back to what i was doing on my phone almost immediately. I noticed him mumbling something but i was too engrossed to pick out the words. The next thing i knew was him ranting at me claiming i wasn't talking to him because he Mexican and calling a racist. Now please tell me how does sitting in a restaurant and waiting for your order to arrive make me a racist. I had to call security on his ass for me to have some peace, that was when i noticed my order had already been brought to my table. I think people should learn to mind their business and leave people alone when they are not in the mood to talk. I had to go for 15 minutes walk before i could go back to my work. He basically made me waste 15 extra minutes of my precious time. The good thing is that i was able to finish all i needed to do in due time",,3L0KT67Y8F2CGCB2KNTI3PZTM3PYSN
