To start with my relaxing morning I drew a bath with a bath bomb I'd been saving for such an occasion. The water was nice, warm and smelled delightful. I soaked for about 30 minutes. After my bath I looked around the house and realized it was a mess. To put my mind at ease I start tiding up and deep clean a good portion of my apartment. Now that my home looked as good as I felt, I began to get dressed to go to eat. I had given Mel a call to meet me there and she agreed. Feeling good and looked even better I grabbed my keys and went off. I finally get to the restaurant and I sit there wait for Mel to arrive. She texted me and said that she was gonna be a little late due to an accident on the freeway. I go ahead and order some coffee and a pastry while I wait. To get myself ahead in work for the following week, I respond and plan with client's requests and answer any questions they might have. As I'm sitting there typing, I notice a man checking me out from a couple tables in front of me. I looked over and it was clear to me that he wasn't my type. As I looked we had a split second of eye contact. He smiles and approaches me at the table. As he's walking up to the table, I desperately grab my phone and continue replying to clients. He looks at me and asks if I wanted to go out sometime. I tell him no. He makes another attempt and again I reject him. He gets frustrated and completely goes off. He goes on and calls me a bitch making a scene in the whole restaurant. He starts using racial slurs and tells me that I'm not pretty enough for him because of it. Embarrassed and harassed, I try to go on about my day but couldn't stop thinking about the incident.",,3L0KT67Y8F2CGCB2KNTI3PZTM3PYSN
