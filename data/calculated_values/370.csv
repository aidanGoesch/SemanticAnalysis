I graduated with a degree in finance but didnt ever have an internship so that limited me. I moved in with my parents and started applying but everywhere wanted experience even at entry level. About 4 weeks ago though i finally got a call back and interviewed. The interview went well and I was offered a position. I am beyond excited for this and will be good to have my own money. I am planning on saving up for 3 months and then getting an apartment of my own. I will be sad to leave my parents house but it will be nice to finally move on with my life and start growing up and feeling more adult. I will be buying my parents a nice gift as a thank you for all their support. Work is going well and I am starting to get the hang of things. I wish it were easier for more people to get jobs. Many friends straight out of college have been having issues. I hope some day to become a manager at the firm im working at. Eventually I should work my way up but for now I am content where I am at. Overall life is looking up for me.,,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM2H3BIGS
