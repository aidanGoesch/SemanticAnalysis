I am going to move out with my boyfriend eventually and will have to get another job. I am nervous about it because I have bad anxiety. I'm hoping I do ok. I'm going to see if I can get councling. Councling would help alot I would assume. Though last time I had it, it didnt. So my assumption is really more of a hope. Worse comes to worse I get medication. I dont want medication because it upsets my tummy. I need a good tummy for a good working job. I also need good mental health for a good job. I hope my new job is good.
