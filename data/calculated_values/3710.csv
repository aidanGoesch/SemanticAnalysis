I did not know much of the details in how the funeral service was going to be performed. Basically, the man that attended my grandfather's funeral did so in a somewhat unusual or non-traditional way. I respected it and appreciated it, of course. I personally did not know him, but my grandfather did. But, anyway, once he finished speaking - he did not ask if anyone else had any words to say. Everyone was getting up and stirring about as he just walked away. I then immediately walked towards the front, and then I spoke up and said I'd like to say something. I was so afraid that I was being inappropriate, but I really wanted to honor him.  After I said my words, many people immediately ran up to me and started to thank me and I felt so relieved. I loved him so much, and I miss him. I think about him every single day. For the first few weeks, he was the first thing I thought of immediately when I woke up every day. I am glad that I was able to honor him.  Had I not, I would have always regretted it.",3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJABQINU6,
