There was a prize awarded to one random viewer.  I was lucky enough to win .  The prize was a small selection of the jewelry that she sells.  I was very pleasantly surprized when I found out that I won.  I often enter contests and giveaways like this and I never win.  The jewelry is not expensive, but it is very attractive and it was a nice set that I won.  There were 2 necklaces, 2 pairs of earings, and 2 bracelet sets in the selection.  It was a good pick me up for me as I was having a bit of a difficult week at the time.  I used to be very sceptical about entering contests because I never won.   Now I feel like I am more likely to win.  I think the possibility of winning is something nice to look forward to.  I am going to continue to enter contests and look forward to possibly winning.  If I don't win, I will know that someone else had the pleasant experience of being the winner.  The contests are free and it doesn't hurt to try.  Maybe one day I could even win a large or expensive prize.",,3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJADCUNUS
