This particular new company notified me of a phone interview I needed to carry out with them and I did that and was later invited for a meet and greet dinner. In  the long run, I was expecting this since it was a phone Interview earlier and the company would want to have a physical interaction with their employee. As usual, I found out the name of the restaurant, also took time to check out their menu online and found out the names of the persons I would be meeting at the dinner; the CEO and all that using a search engine, Google to be precise.             I took time to also study the company and the position I was applying for. With all this, I was set for the dinner as at the evening of that day by 6:00 pm, I was dressed professionally, On getting there ,I turned my phone off ,I interacted with my employers politely, observed good table manners and answered all questions trowed at me with as much confidence as I could. This was a wonderful experience for me. We kept on keeping a conversation and the employees weren't so strict after all. I also enjoyed the environment. The restaurant was cozy and the noise was controlled. I could have space and time to feel relaxed and think properly. I must say that digging into the juicy steak offered was difficult but since I knew the interviewers where expecting me to eat, I planned before hand. I also ordered for something that was easy to eat aside the steak. I stayed away from messy dishes. In all, I was involved in the conversation too. I asked my interviewers questions when I deemed it necessary. At the end of the dinner, they Extended me an offer . I accepted the job and gave notice.",,3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJAM8BNUA
