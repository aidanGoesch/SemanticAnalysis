A wedding that we had been planning for almost an year with my fiancee and both families. I had been saving for almost 5 years just to have a church wedding when i get married. All went well, all arrangements were in place until shit happened .There  was a disagreement between us ,the disagreement was as result of a call from my ex girl friend,the lady just called to congratulate me on my upcoming wedding. Sincerely speaking nothing was going on between us. It was a misinterpretation ,i wish she could have understand but she couldn't give me an earMy fiancee that that i was still seeing this girl but it wasn't that way. I tried explaining to my fiancee but she couldn't trust me,she shouted and me abused me and called me names. She removed the engagement ring on her fingers and through it on my face. It was a bad dramaThe priest and church leaders tried to intervene but in vain. She called the mum ,the mum game over we tried to talk but the lady was so emotional ,she didn't want to here anything from anybody. We  had to off the wedding that was scheduled to be the next day. My parent tried talking to her but she could t hear. It was a drama that caught the eyes of everyone in the church compoundIt was such emotional day to me and my parents all the money we had invested in the wedding just went like that. I felt so bad and disappointing ,i locked myself in the house for three days crying. I couldn't  eat was very affected ,till now have not recovered from what happened. Right now am  not even ready to get  to get into a new relationship. But i'm still praying that she will come to her senses and realize she did something wrong. Right now i'm coming into terms with what happened to me and i know i will overcome.",,3L4PIM1GQU20FXBP5YTDDFUX7E8YRY
