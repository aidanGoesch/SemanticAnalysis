The relationship at first started off real good. We saw each other every day. We did some things together but not enough to keep me interested. He was a good person and we would watch movies every night. The most memorable thing was he treated me right. He never did me wrong any kind of way. He didn't come at me crazy like some people did. He treated me right respect and we got along very well. When we first met, it took us almost a month to actually see each other in person. Anyone else would want to see me within a few days at that. The memorable event I felt good about it because it made me feel good not to feel that way than anyone else would make me feel. The whole memorable event made me realize to give people a chance that I wouldn't normally would. I look at it like this that I can't help who I like but at the same time I try to give people chances. I want to say this that I don't mind these memorable events because it keeps me happy at times when I'm bored or something.",,3L4PIM1GQU20FXBP5YTDDFUXZPKYRO
