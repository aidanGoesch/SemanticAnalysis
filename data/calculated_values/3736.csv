We had a small fight the morning of, and that evening when we were heading to her mother's, she was giving me the cold shoulder. My girlfriend and I have been together for over 4 years, and we rarely fight; I could count the number of times we have on my hand. So, this bus ride was extremely uncomfortable and sad for me. Once we arrived at the bus station, we were picked up by her step dad and brought to a restaurant. It was her mother's birthday, and so her step-dad and her mom had invited a few of their close family friends to the restaurant. The restaurant had a warm, cozy atmosphere, and everyone was excited to see us. The men sat on one side of the table, so we could talk about sports, our lives, and whatever else was on our mind; the girls sat on the other side and spoke about family drama (I'm not sexist, I'm just sharing what happened). As the drinks came in, her step-dad and friend of the family began to talk about their experiences with certain issues in their lives. Her step-dad's friend talked about his experience with severe anxiety and panic attacks, along with depression. I was surprised, because he was so extroverted, cool to be around, and happy-looking. I explained that I too suffer from these conditions, and that although I am on medication and receiving Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, I was still struggling but getting much better. He was a little surprised but was very supportive and explained that he has been in therapy for years, and has been doing amazing since he started therapy. For once, I was finally able to connect with someone in her family. I find it hard to enter conversations because they speak french, and I'm mostly English, so this felt nice. Meanwhile, my girlfriend is drinking and becoming more talkative. We looked at each other at one point and apologized, we kissed, and instantly felt better about that morning's fight. The food arrived, and we were all eating, talking, sharing stories and laughs. After the restaurant, we went to an ice-cream place and I got my favorite ice-cream cone: Soft serve vanilla ice-cream dipped in cookies-n'-cream. It was to die for. Afterwards, the family friends returned to their homes, and we went back to her mother's place. We spent the night playing games with my girlfriends younger siblings. Once they went to bed, we spoke to her mother about our recent struggles in each of our lives (finances, depression, anxiety, school grades plummeting, etc) and she gave us some helpful advice and support. She went into her life details and it turned out that she had a lot of similar experiences we had. That night, my girlfriend and I fell asleep wrapped in each others arms, at complete peace with one another and feeling like two peas in a pod.",,3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VM1ZMAD4
