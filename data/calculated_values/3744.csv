I really felt like I needed to be there and be there for her and the rest of my family. It has been a number of years since we all were together and it was very important. Last year my grandfather passed away so it was even more meaningful for all of to be there for her. I also looked at my own life and decided to change my relationships with my parents which have been stressed and difficult my entire life. My parents have been very controlling and my grandmother was always a close connection to me. I was always able to rely on her. She was my greatest connection and stablized me. I always have been her favorite I think. Its funny because I never apprecaited that until I had kids. Its so important to bond with people. I just want to help with her and make things better. I think this also will increase my time with her in the future. I am going to change my plans going forward. I want to help her.,3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMR3GADW,
