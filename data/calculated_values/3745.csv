It was a huge event with family members flying in from all over the world for the event. Some of these people I had not seen for ten years and others, I had never met. It was so amazing to have everyone gathered in one place and for me it was especially important because my Grandmother has always been my rock growing up. She raised me on her own and has always been more of a mother to me than my actual mom. Her guidance, advice and sense of morality has been my core for my entire life. To see how happy she was and how emotional she was as more and more people came into the room, you couldn't help but cry in joy. It just made me think about how important it is to have a sense of yourself and a connection with others. I have always had a hard time bonding and letting my guard down, but this experience further reiterated the need to be able to do that. Seeing all of my various family members and seeing them all connecting again made me so happy. It also made me realize that isolating myself from the world and from relationships was not something that was healthy nor was it helpful for the bigger picture of life. I know my Grandmother wants me to be happy. I know that I need to be happy. However, I need to change my outlook on things in order for this to occur. I need to branch out, maybe move to a new place, and have a fresh start in life. I think I need to be my own person and put myself in some new situations in order to truly grow.",3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMR3GADW,3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMR3GADW
