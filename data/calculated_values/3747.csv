It was the most emotional thing that I've been through recently.  Monkey was my best friend and companion for 12 years.  She got me through the hardest times of my life, like when I went through a divorce and moved across the country to start my life over again.  Monkey was with me every day, through all of the tears, and she always made me feel better.   She was not eating, and acting very strange, so I took her to the vet.  After running some tests, the vet informed me that Monkey had cancer, and it had spread throughout her body.  The vet told me that I could spend $5,000. 00 to give her some  treatments, but she would still probably die within 6 months.  After thinking it over for 2 days, i decided not to prolong things and to have Monkey put to sleep, so she wouldn't be in pain anymore.  The morning I took her to the vet to have her put to sleep, was the saddest morning of my life.  I'm crying as I type this, so it's still very hard for me.  I stayed with her as the doctor gave her a shot to first put her to sleep, and then another shot to stop her heart.  She was in my arms when she went to sleep, which makes me feel better. I have to keep reminding myself that she's not in pain anymore, and I did the right thing.  I keep second guessing myself, and wondering if I should've just paid the 5 grand to have her with me a little bit longer. I think that's being selfish though, and I dont think Monkey would've wanted to go through each day in pain, that would get worse as time went on.  People have told me that it will get easier for me as time goes by, but some days it feels like the pain will never go away.  Some days I don't think about it a lot, and other days, like today, it feels like it just happened. I haven't gotten another cat yet, but I'm looking into it, and will probably get a kitten soon.  For me, pets are just as important as people, and they have a positive impact on everyones lives.   I feel better knowing that Monkey is in Heaven, and I will see her again someday.",,3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNUB7E9X4
