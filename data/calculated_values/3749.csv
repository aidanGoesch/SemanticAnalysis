I’ve always seen myself in the small, upscale neighborhood of Isle but didn’t know if I would be able to afford it after college. I learned about Isle when I visited a childhood friend of mines new home when I was in high school. The neighborhood is located on the coast of one of the Great Lakes and embodies perfect coastal town charm. Because the homes here have beachfront property, I knew it would be expensive to move here. I made a plan during my sophomore year of college to move to the town. I started by narrowing down jobs that I could apply for close to the town that would allow me to make money. Once I located a couple of businesses that I’d be happy to work for, I started researching internships that I could take during the summer between semesters.  Next thing I knew I was applying and interviewing for the internships. I had hoped that these would help me get a foot in the door. I was lucky enough to land one of the internships I wanted. So for the next three years, I did the absolute best I could in classes. I studied hard and made sure to take each course seriously. During the summers, I interned for the same company in hopes that I would receive a job offer. It was getting towards the end of my internship during my senior year and I still didn’t have an offer. I started to worry that maybe I hadn’t done enough. In fact, I got so much anxiety I called my parents every night to talk to them and have them reassure me that things would work out. And they were right, just one week before my final internship ended, my supervisor sat me down and offered me a job. While I kept it calm on the outside, on the inside I was screaming with excitement. I accepted the job and began looking for a place to live in my favorite neighborhood of Isle. I’ve only been here four weeks now but it was definitely the right decision for me and now I’m ready to take on new goals.",,3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNUU0O9XJ
