We met and the same day we met I believe we fell in love. we spent the entire day together. after that we were inseperable. We traveled the US together and we had the best of times we have ever had with one another. I was stupid and I ran away. Because of that she has gotten with someone else and married them. I know she is not happy. I know she still thinks about us everyday and I know she dosen't want to be where she is, and with whom she is with. I have to find a way to get her back. I am not interested in anyone else whatsoever. And I think she thought she could just ignore her feelings. She does a good job of faking it, But I know the real story. We have had some of the best times, but also, some of the worst times. I know though she still loves me, and I know I am still the love of her life. I have been patient. I have not even dated since I left. Why I left? I was scared of what had happened, and I was scared of hurting her anymore then I already had. But now I know she just wanted it to work. I believe if she were to give me another chance it would work. we could work things out, I do believe it could be even better then it was before. Im gonna wait. I havent heard from her, but I send he emails from time to time, so she knows Im waiting , and That I still love her.",3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA01357M69ZD,
