We had argued a million times in the past but always worked through them. we traveled the world together , and never really had many arguments we couldn't get past. I don't know what happened. I just got angry and said , well or thought. the hell with this I'm leaving.. I should have just got away until we both had calmed down. now I am always along and its sad. I only think of her, I cant eat , I cant sleep . I'm just beside myself with anguish. She wont answer my phone call, or letters, and I try every day to get in touch but her ex answers her phone and tell me to get lost.. hes not good for her, and she knows it, we have even discussed it a hundred times. So now I'm gonna have to find a way to get her back....also I am taking to her family for help. They want me to get her back and they also pass messages to her from me. I think she has made a grave mistake not allowing time to pass to see how this is such a bad choice on both of our parts but we shall see.",3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA01357M69ZD,3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA01357M69ZD
