I was working at a famous restaurant in a major U.S. metropolitan area known for it’s dining scene. The place was crazy busy as usual, with an hour wait for a table; the bar was three-deep; everyone was working full-speed-ahead. A couple walked in, obviously tourists: Fisherman’s Wharf sweatshirt, sensible walking shoes, the kind of skin that suggests years of working outside. After making their way through the crowd, they walked up to the host and asked if they could sit one of my just-vacated tables. The host replied, “You can if you’re Tippen!” The guy handed the host a buck, who proceeded to escort the couple to their seats. Suddenly, I was told later, a man walks up to the host and asks why “those people” were seated ahead of him and his wife, while they had been patiently waiting for well-over a half hour. The perplexed host explained that the host he called out the next name of the list: Tippen. “But I’M Tippen!” the man asserted. The host apologized, walked up to soon to be confused party of two, threw the dollar down on their table and blurted, “That’s not the way we do things around here!” It wasn’t until the host walked back to assuage the passed-over guests’ feelings that the homonymic connection between “Tippen” and “tipping” would light up his brain like a bolt of electricity. The couple was allowed to finish their meal in peace. I don't think anyone ever explained to them what happened. I do recall they seemed rather befuddled and perplexed when I first went up to them. The host had initially told me to ignore them. One can imagine they are still reminiscing about their weird experience is San Francisco.",3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA01358G9Z9V,
