My family and I went to a restaurant to celebrate my brother's birthday. We ate and drank and had a really good time. The next morning I woke up feeling a little weird, not exactly sick, but not myself either. I decided to skip breakfast that morning before heading off to work because of the way I was feeling, and because I'm not a big breakfast eater anyway. Things went downhill from there. I had no appetite that day, but decided not to force myself to eat, thinking that my appetite has to come back eventually. I was wrong. The day after that I felt worse, and again didn't eat. After the third day with no appetite, I decided to make an appointment with my doctor. She ran some tests and asked me what medications I was taking. To my surprise, she told me that not having any appetite for a few days is not all that unusual. She did list some pretty scary things that could be causing my lack of appetite, but said she didn't think it was anything serious. She told me to try to force myself to eat, and to come back in a couple of days if there was no improvement. Well, I tried to do what she said, but I just couldn't make myself eat, because I couldn't even stand the sight of food at that point, and  I missed my appointment with her two days later because I just didn't feel like leaving the house. The next day I began to feel faint. My sister-in-law was with me because she had heard I wasn't feeling well and had come by to check on me. She immediately suggested we go to the emergency room. After seeing how pale and weak I was, they decided to admit me right away. After being admitted, I spent three days in the hospital and they ran more tests, but still couldn't determine the reason for my lack of appetite. In the hospital, they had me on an intravenous drip, and were somewhat successful in getting me to eat a little. Also, while in the hospital they put me on medication to increase my appetite. After the three days I was well enough to go home, I am still on the medication, and my appetite is back to normal.",,3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA0135A5P9Z1
