I think about that from time to time. it was a benchmark in my life, really. I remember some nutso woman on Facebook telling me, ""Just force yourself to eat! That's what I tell my daughter and sister-in-law when they make such a nonsense bitch! Just EAT!""And that woman was crazy. Forcing yourself to eat probably works most of the time for most people. But what I was suffering from was almost ... an ANTI-eating illness. My body didn't WANT me to eat food. And that is truly weird. I should do some Internet research and find out what was going on with my system.	And I still find it .... interesting, that after taking the medication I was given to make me eat, I now eat regularly with no problem. (I just wish I had better food to eat!)I wonder if my current weird eating habits now have anything to do with my previous problem? I love toast with scads of margarine spread on it. And I'm suddenly really like strawberry. Strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, strawberry whatever. :)But just so long as I am EATING, it is much, **much** better for me, health wise, than what I was going through a few months ago. Thanks for this opportunity, and have a good day!!",3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA0135A5P9Z1,
