A struggle that made me stronger in the long run.  When I graduated from high school, I had no idea what to do with my life.  I took a job at a local diner frying up greasy food for obnoxious drunks and others, but the pay was poor and I was tired of living in my hometown.  I desired adventure.  I enlisted because someone told me that I could travel around the world and get paid good money and benefits without a college degree.  To make a long story short, the Army was no picnic.  I did my four years and decided to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I gained a lot in the military, but it didn't fit my personality.  I figured I'd take the money that I received for college and get that degree that I'd been avoiding.  Unfortunately, things didn't work out the way that I had hoped.  College wasn't for me either, so I dropped out after a series of failing grades and lack of interest in a major.  The college money from the military, as well as my savings,quickly ran out.  I ended up sleeping on the couches of friends and eventually, they got tired of me.  I got another greasy spoon job, but it didn't pay enough to afford rent, especially deposit and utilities.  I could have stayed at a cheap motel, but I figured I was better in the streets.  After being robbed a few times, and run off by cops, I decided to swallow my pride and go to a shelter.  The local city mission took me in, fed me a few times a day, and helped me find a better job.  Even though on the surface I was better, I was struggling with depression from my experiences and had a breakdown.  The shelter helped me to get some mental health treatment, and in six months I was ready to move into a small efficiency apartment.  I didn't have furniture, and I slept on a air mattress but it was mine and I could afford it.  In a few years, I had learned a trade, saved some money,  and moved to Florida a few months ago.  I have a good paying job, a much nicer apartment in a good neighborhood.  Things are looking up for me.",,3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA0135J0WZ9X
