We live near a river and have always been a bit concerned about flooding and have spent a few sleepless nights keeping an eye on the water. A couple months ago we were expecting the same experience. Things turned out very different however. We had experienced a couple days of rain but nothing really serious. It was a Friday unlike many others. My mother always tends to worry about flooding and went several times to check the water level. She seemed a bit more nervous but I assured her everything would be fine. Around six PM the river had filled beyond capacity and came out into the field. This had happened several times before so I wasn't terribly concerned. This time turned out to be different. The rain began to pick to pick up and soon the field right below our home was covered. This also had happened a couple times, and while I wasn't afraid at this point, I did start to feel concerned. The rain continued to increase. Suddenly water started to rise near the back of our home. This had never happened before. We debated leaving but by this time it was dark out. We tried calling 911 but learned many were trapped and no one was currently available. We would have to wait. Within the span of 40 minutes our house was completely surrounded by water. It was terrifying. Everywhere you looked all you could see was dark water.  I think it was probably the most afraid I have ever been. Help never showed up and thankfully towards morning the water began to recede. It was a night I will never forget and hope to never relive.",,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFS8ZHDB1
