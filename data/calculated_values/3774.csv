I was particularly excited since most of the people at this house I had no idea who they were since it was for a friend who i am close with, but not his group of friends. So we all got to the house and of course, nobody was there since I had gotten off of work late. I find out that we are all over on at a bar down the street so I head out over that way. I meet everyone and the beers start flowing pretty generously. That evening we all took a turn for the worst as we all struggled to make it to bar close and then back to the air bnb where we were all staying. That night I ended up going home since the Air BNB didnt have any AC in it. I mean, who gets an Air BNB with no AC?! It was super humid, so it was tough to stay there. That morning, some of the bros came over to my house and we had a few beers. We headed back over the Air bib since that day we were all going to go to a brewers game by way of the party bus. Well the party bus was of course an hour late to pick us up and actually had no AC just like the air bnb which we thought was all really funny. So we partied all day at a tailgate and met lots of new people. Since none of the people who were at this bachelor party really knew eachother, it was fun to see everyone's differnet traditions and norms for getting turned up in a parking lot. We learned tons of new games and pretty much drank a truck load of white claws during teh course of the day. You know as they say, Aint no laws when youre drinking claws. So after the game, which im amazing we ever made it to teh seats, we made it back to the bus and then out and about downtown. The night ended just as strong as it had begin. That evening we all got back to the house, had tons more white claws, and i parted ways with the group since it was way too hot for me to stay there. I met new friends with whom i exhanged numbers with and i cannot wait to hang out more with them in the coming future.",3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSZXEBDJ,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSZXEBDJ
