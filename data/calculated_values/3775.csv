It happened about 3 months ago or so. My beloved grandpa whom I love dearly got sick. And my dumb cunt of a grandma wanted to divorce him years ago. However, knew she wouldn't be getting anything as he made her sign a pre-nup. So when he gets sick what does she do? The fucking evil bitch lies to the doctors. I believe that she took advantage of the situation by telling them stuff that was going on that wasn't going on. He was pretty much in a daze because of all the different medicine. And naturally she was the power of attorney and so whatever she told the doctors they were going to listen. He didn't even have a chance to defend himself. Now he's in some fucking mental ward. I don't even know what to think or what to do. My own grandmother lied to me, lied to all of the family. She lied to herself, she betrayed us all. I am so hurt and I don't know who to trust anymore. I'm very reserved now, and feel like a hermit crab sitting in my apartment by myself drinking jack daniels and eating burnt toast...",,3LJ7UR74RIZZ2S5DNKOPO6LGEZ34NJ
