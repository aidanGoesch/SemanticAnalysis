It is easy to trust those around us, such as family and close friends.  Recently, my grandfather had a stroke.  He lost some of his motor skills and memory.  It may have changed him, but he was still a precious man.  He and my grandmother have been married over fifty years, and it would seem that there would be love and empathy, but there was none from her.  She had zero admiration, only hate for her husband.  She has claimed that there have been some significant events surrounding my grandfather, such as him urinating in the closet, running away, and chasing her throughout the house beating her.  My grandmother voiced her hatred for my grandfather stating that he had cashed a life insurance policy out during the 1980's for $5000, and she would never forgive him for that.  She simply could not let go of that, and her two daughters followed suit with their hatred toward my grandfather.  He had given all of them everything he could financially and from his heart.  His efforts were in vain because of the lies my grandmother told, she was able to commit my grandfather to a psychiatric ward.  It is a mental institution for the criminally insane, and he is a veteran.  He is unable to stand up for himself, and my family made him property of the state.  My grandmother also made arrangements that when he dies, the local university can have his body for science.  She has dared the family to have a funeral or memorial service.  A week ago, my mother called and said that she heard from my grandmother that my grandfather clinically died, but was revived.  He is all alone in a strange place, and he is very sick.  I am devastated.  The whole situation has made me consider how someone can make up lies about you, and there can be legal ramifications.  The very people that you firmly believe love you are the very people that are distrustful.  It has also opened my eyes to how important an advanced directive and a will are in order to protect people if they are ever incapacitated from evil people in their lives.  It is certainly impossible to know who to truly trust.",,3LJ7UR74RIZZ2S5DNKOPO6LGEZ34NJ
