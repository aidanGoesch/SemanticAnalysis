It occurred within the last month actually. It may not be something others would find very unique or special but it was to me. Throughout this past July and August, my long distance significant other came to stay with me for the longest time we've spent together. We've been together for 3 years but this has been the only time we've spent 4 straight weeks together. He's currently in school while I work full time. We're a bit over 4000 miles apart. We don't have many opportunities to spend lots of time together so this meant a great deal to me. We didn't actually do much of particular interest. He stayed in my apartment with me and my sister. We just enjoyed our time together. We talked about everything under the sun. Watched shows together we had put off so we could do it together. I taught him a new card game. We played other various video games together. Cooked together. He helped dye my hair. I introduced him to my mother and stepfather for the very first time as well. I wouldn't have changed a thing and I'll always think back on the time fondly.",,3LKC68YZ3BPTTFO9Y5ULYN4CMD7WOW
