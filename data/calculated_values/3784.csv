I was at the local Bar and Grill hanging out with some friends.  We was drinking and playing some pool, when all of a sudden my phone started ringing.  I answered the call and it was another friend on the end of the line.  He told me that I and my band had been chosen to open for musical group on an upcoming musical tour.  I couldn't believe what I was hearing.  My other buddy at the bar with me took my phone and placed it on speaker.  He held it up high so everyone at the bar could hear the news. The Bar and Grill played the message over the intercom PA system.  Everyone at the Bar cheered with delight.  But the best part was when the announcement came who we had been chosen to open for.  None other than the great band Def Leppard.  They had recently been in retirement but decided to do a reunion tour.  It  blew my mind to think that they had chosen me to be their opening act.  Me as well as the other patrons in the bar celebrated into the wee hours of the morning.  It was a great night had by everyone there.",,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EU86ILGU
