He is the sweetest guy. He makes me smoothies every morning. We hang out all the time too. We watch netflix and chill. It's so fun. I just love having moved in with him. It has been the best experience and decision of my life. It's so cool. I'm really glad that I thought it was a good idea and went for it because my life has really increased and I'm so much happier now. It's so awesome. I really love it. It's such a good time to be alive and I'm so proud of my decision making skills. One thing and probably the only thing that bothers me is the mess in the bathroom. It always smells in there like he went on the floor. I don't know how to bring this up to him but the stink really bothers me. I hope he can learn to control himself in there better..,,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUWQUGLT
