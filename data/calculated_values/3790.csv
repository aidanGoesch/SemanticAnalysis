I then was placed on disability social security and suddenly found myself retired. Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I.     Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier. Her name was Debbie. While talking with her on New Year's Day 2019, she mentioned she was lonely, as was I. She said she was very single and living with her son in Daytona Beach Florida and invited me down (I lived in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio at the time.)      I planned to visit her, as I was nearing the end of my operations, and pretty sick of Northern winter weather. So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year. I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss. I found and find her very attractive still.     When I got back up north, I still played in my mind the idea of moving down to Daytona Beach. My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio. No job, no children, friends were far gone. Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down.     I found a home in June of 2019, that sounded great! It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past.     When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live. There was no house. I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home. The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it.     And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now. And the relationship with Debbie is more of a friend thing than a romantic one I was hoping for. But, I plan to now make this my home and see what happens.",3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUY72GL1,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUY72GL1
