It's been gone for 4 months and I still regret selling it. I know it is trivial to miss a car, but I have so many awesome memories while driving it.  I remember the day I bought my Chevy Corvette. It was 1970 and I was 23 years old. I had landed a great job and decided to buy a new car. I got to the dealership and fell in love with it the moment I saw it. I knew that was going to be MY car. It was so slick and I just knew that I would look so cool driving it around town. I would definitely be a hit with the ladies. In fact, it helped land my first date with the beautiful woman that is now my wife. 30 years and a 1000s of memories later, I had to say goodbye.  It was a relic of my youth and I knew selling it would go towards a good cause. I had decided to start a college fund for my new grandson. One day I'll tell him about my electric blue 1970 Chevy Corvette and maybe he will fall in love with cars too.",,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUZ97GLB
