I was elated to have her. She is the most beautiful thing in the world. She is a little tiny thing, but huge in my heart. She has a full head of hair, and it is so cute. The whole family is excited. She loves wrestling my fingers, and I love it. She was pretty big for her age. That happens a lot in the family. She has brought happiness. She is so cool. We have been so happy. She is looking around her. She loves seeing new things. Her eyes glow and she smiles. It is so cool to watch. She fills everyone with happiness. Her beautiful hair glistens in the sun too.",,3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYTI3WF8
