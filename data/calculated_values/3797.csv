After all the time spent waiting, she's here, happy, healthy, and beautiful. She's absolutely perfect! Everything went smoothly for the most part, and her mother is resting comfortably. I could not have asked for more. I'm so thankful for every blessing I have been given. After 9 long moths of waiting, we got to meet our baby girl. She is the sweetest most adorable baby girl I have ever seen, but I may be biased! After having a toddler that's 100% boy, and can destroy things with great ease, I hope she is a much more calm experience. At least until her teens, then there's a whole-nother set of problems to worry about. I look forward to the future to see what they'll both become. You never know what life has in store for you. As I write this i think about how short life really seems when you get to my age, and that all you want is to see your family be happy and successful. Time to go now. The little one needs me!",,3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYTI3WF8
