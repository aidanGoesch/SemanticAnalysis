It was a family outing and it sounded boring.  I hadn't been to the zoo in ages and there was a reason for that.  It was hot outside and I wasn't in the mood to sweat.  They brought out the fishing gear and my heart sank.  I hate fishing.  Sitting there waiting for some dumb critter it impale itself on a hook isn't my idea of fun.  Against my will I went.  It was hot but I dressed for the occasion.  I go a lot of sun and managed to stroll through the zoo without a problem.  Later, at the part, a couple of fish fell for the bait and we caught them.  I couldn't believe it.  Once we caught them, we didn't know what to do with them and it was funny turning them back into the pond.  They slashed and got a few of us wet.  In the end, we had fun and I was glad I went.  Everyone was very tired after we got home.",,3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYTIXFWL
