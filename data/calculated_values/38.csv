I was hesitant about going, because while I like hanging out with Erik, I do not know most of his good friends that would be going to the party. Many of my other friends also were not going to be there because they were travelling that weekend. Despite this, I decided to show up and spend my entire day at the party. I didn't even prepare a backup plan in case I was having a bad time and needed to leave abruptly. I was fully committed to having fun at the party. Well as it turns out, I had a great time. I instantly made some new friends to keep close to for a majority of the party and we played a lot of games to help integrate everyone together and get everyone included. Everyone I met was nice and friendly and everyone made everyone feel welcome. I had a great time and wound up staying at the party from right when it started right up until it ended. This was a pretty big deal for me because I am very shy. I am especially shy around new people. However, I was able to break out of my shell and enjoy myself. I'm happy I did. I had a lot of fun and made some new friends that I will be in contact with more going forward. I cannot wait for the next get together with all of these people.",30BUDKLTXEHD45W08Q4G3BXLQRX5E2,
