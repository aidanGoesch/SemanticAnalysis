We had noticed he had been acting out of character but kept our suspicions to ourselves. But once we found this public documentation, we proceeded to tell one of our other supervisors. The information finally made it to our HR department but was held there with no other information to us. They brought the main owner in who then looked over the information and said they would get back to us. But instead of having a meeting, decided to have both of us write out statements. Things got tense around the office because some how, not by us, others found out about the situation and were angry. When we are drug tested, if you fail, they either won't hire you or you are to be terminated. Well this supervisor tested positive 3 days after he was hired so we don't know how he passed on the first place. A week went by and we were told they were not going to do anything to him. At this point, my department became even more upset. Other department supervisors found out and went to the owner as well very upset saying they have to do something. Finally, they had meeting one by one with my department. Nothing has been done and the person is still working and driving a company vehicle. So far the only thing to come out of this, is that we are being made to feel punished and like we did something wrong by protecting the company.",,3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYVZ6WFB
