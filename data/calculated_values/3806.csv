I have about four classes left which is super exciting and just recently I took my latest pre-practicum. It is essentially a face to face test where you test your counseling skills to see if you are competent in those areas.  I did well but it would a bit of a struggle at the beginning. The main reason for the struggle is that I had not done really any practice on my face to face counseling skills.  I did pass the test and it was a fun trip.  The convention of sorts was held in Phoenix Arizona and I drove there which took about four hours.  It was a fun trip as I went with my wife and we stayed in a hotel close to the area were I would be doing my studying and test.  I enjoyed everything about the event for the most part.  I am very excited to get my degree and begin a new adventure into counseling but I am not done yet.  I will have to complete 1000 hours of internship before I can officially be a licensed counselor.  This is a daunting task that I am not looking forward to because they require you to complete 20-30 hours a week.  Although in theory this doesn't seem like much but when you work a full time job 40 hours a week and have other responsibilities throughout the weeks its something that can really have a huge affect on my life.  I know its going to be hard because essentially I will be working 60-70 hours a week.  The other problems is how will I be able to fit those hours into my work schedule.  This is something that I have thought about and I am confident I can do it but it just seems like a lot of things could go wrong.  I will definitely have to be ready to take action and be able to get a decent amount of sleep throughout this time.  This is going to be very hard but I have a lot of faith in my ability to succeed.,,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFG5TX2XI
