Refrigerator is a very must thing in everyone's house. Because we can't able to go supermarket everyday. so we have to buy some vegetable in a week or monthly once. We kept in refrigerator. But since two months we were very struggle to keep vegetables in milk in our house. So we decided to ask help to our adult child. They save their packet money in their wallet. we don't have other option than to ask help to our children. After they decided to help us we bought double door refrigerator to our home. we went to home appliance mall with our children. and select refrigerator what they like. They were very happy with us to decided their choice. we pay for our new refrigerator. Now we are so happy and proud with our children.,,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFG5TYX2E
