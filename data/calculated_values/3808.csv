We had to use coolers filled with ice for about three weeks. Our son webcam-med us. And let us know that . Him and his sister. Wanted to purchase the new refrigerator for us. I was a little reluctant at first. Because our kids are young. And just starting out. But they insisted. So I let them.  We purchased a brand new Frigidaire refrigerator. Using my son's credit card. And still today. I am overwhelmed with the fact. That our kids wanted to help out. And give back. I feel so blessed to have they children. That we have. I know all my efforts to raise children with good character. Have paid off. I am a very proud parent.,,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFG5TYX2E
