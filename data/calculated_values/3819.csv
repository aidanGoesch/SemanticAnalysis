The roar of the Harley between my legs. The wind blowing over me. What a rush to finally be out on the road, driving up PCH. I think back to five months ago when I got my motorcycle license.  I was so nervous. They have you drive around a little track at the DMV. This is the hardest part because I had to ride my motorcycle around some obstacles. Getting on and finishing my turn was scary. I was the fifth one out of ten people that Saturday morning. Thanks to Governer Newsom, I was able to complete my test on a Saturday instead of taking time off work. This test looks easy, but getting on the bike and actually doing it is a whole nother story. But I did it! I passed that little DMV obstacle couse, finished my turn and got my motorcycle license! And now here I am, driving from up the coast with no destination in mind other than being on my bike.",,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFGVX02XJ
