Sure, they are still young, but they are so independent in many ways. There's no more changing diapers, hourly feeding. throughout my kiddo’s first year of school, I've already watch them change. she has become more confident, come home telling me stories from the classroom and increasingly sprout her independent wings. And while I am thrilled to see her soar high,I also struggle to accept she is not my super-dependent baby anymore. I am more likely to struggle with this adjustment then she is. I am also changing. Not only is my child’s world evolving as they grow, but my world is also changing. Accepting this reality is key. i will only continue to explore new worlds, have adventures, and expand our minds. But no matter where she may roam, even those not-so-""scary"" elementary school hallways. she will always be my ""baby"" and I will always be her mommy. Kindergarten moms, I will be with you in spirit as you drop off your little ones. Enjoy the moments and be ready for a whole new parenting job.",32N49TQG3H4RCMU3YCK7BQ1TQN1VAM,
