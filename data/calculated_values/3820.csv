When I was 18, I had to leave home to study in another city, so my mother thought that I had better got a motorbike so I could easily travel to school. They intended to buy me a pretty one, but I could only get it after I successfully passed the driving exam. I signed up to study in a training course, and it took me about a week to learn all the theory and traffic law. However, the most difficult part was to pass the practical exam, which required me to ride my motorbike over some obstacles. After another week of practice, I finally got to the driving lot. There were a lot of people there, and all of them were as worried as me. I felt that my heart nearly jumped out of my chest, and I could not keep my hands from shaking. I had been through many tests in different subjects in my student life, but I thought that was the only one that made me freak out. The 8 line was the most difficult part, and many people failed to pass it. It made me even more stressful, but my father told me to watch them closely so I could avoid the same mistakes. My name was finally called, and I could not remember exactly how I walked towards the lot, got on the motorbike and finished my turn. I heard something but my vision was blurred, but I was attempted to complete the ride well. My dad almost yelled when I got out, and I was so happy that I hug him really tight. Maybe it is just an ordinary license that anyone can get, but for me it is such a great process and effort; and I will never forget about that event.",,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFGVX02XJ
