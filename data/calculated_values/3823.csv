I began the day waking up early at 4 AM to get some work done. I ate breakfast, hopped in the shower, then packed a bag. After double-checking to make certain I had everything, I pulled at my phone and ordered an Uber. The driver made good time, and, after some delay at the TSA checkpoint on account of my expired driver's license, I boarded the plane. The flight was uneventful, and, after navigating the airport, which had been redesigned since my last visit, I summoned an Uber to take me downtown. I arrived with plenty of time to spare as final preparations were underway. Eventually, people started filling in, until over a hundred people had taken their seats. The Attorney General gave a presentation about the number of lawsuits he was filing against the US Government and the Trump Administration and concluded his remarks after taking a few questions.  For the next few hours, several panel discussions took place, with the audience members frequently peppering the panelists with questions. Once the event had concluded, I stuck around to nibble on the snacks the caterers had prepared and schmoozed with several of the other attendees. Soon, though, I had to excuse myself to grab an Uber back to the airport so I could catch my flight back home. Once again, TSA gave me grief for the expired license and I had to endure a groping, but I was eventually allowed through and made the evening flight with time to spare. After landing, I grabbed an Uber home without much trouble. I needed to unwind, so I tossed my bag in my apartment and headed over to the corner bar. I bumped into a friend and recounted the day over drinks, then called it a night around midnight. I returned home and was sound asleep in no time.",,3LPW2N6LKUOUT1TMYQJL7TJODS3U5B
