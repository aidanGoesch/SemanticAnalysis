We were in the house and her water suddenly broke. I rushed upstairs and got all the stuff we prepared ahead. Everything happened so fast. When we arrived in the hospital my wife was taken to the Operating Room as she need to undergo C section. I was very anxious and was pacing about. After a couple of hours in waiting finally the babies were out. What seemed to a joyful moment suddenly turned into a sad one, as one of the twins needed to be resusitated and was taken immediately to the intensive care. It was really devastating for me and my wife. One baby was doing fine while the other one was fighting for her life. It was difficult to celebrate and be joyful. We spent a couple of weeks in the hospital. After a few weeks one of the twins recovered very well. We were now ready to go home. After several weeks of being apart it was a very happy moment for our family to be together. The babies have recovered and are healthy as well as my wife and I thank God for that.",,3LPW2N6LKUOUT1TMYQJL7TJOMRN5UD
