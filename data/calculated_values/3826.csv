It was our six year anniversary, and of course we decided that we had to go get something delicious to eat. Of course we were going to get sushi! Nothing makes us happier or makes us feel better than going out to get some delicious fresh sushi at our favorite spot. We had slept in all morning, and stayed in bed for most of it because it's freezing cold outside, Alaska was having a terrible cold snap and it was 20 degrees below zero! Our crappy electric heaters were barely keeping up, so we piled extra blankets on the bed and tried our best to stay warm. We smoked and decided it was finally time to head over to our favorite place, Sakura Sushi! Excitedly, we ran out to the car quickly to get in and warm up as fast as possible, but the worst thing happened, it wouldn't turn over. Now what are we going to do? We don't even have a ride over to our favorite spot, which is a bit inconveniently 10 miles away. Disappointment flooded over us as we realized that it would be a huge hassle to ask someone to give us a ride that far. I asked, ""Wait, remember that new place that your Mom brought us to last week? It's only a few blocks down the street, I know it's cold but we could bundle up and totally make it there!"" Ben hesitated but nodded, knowing it was the best chance at a delicious anniversary dinner. We ran back inside and grabbed our scarves, wrapping them around our faces leaving only a tiny hole to see from. We started walking and realized it was even colder than we thought... there was no choice but to huddle up together as we walked and hold each other to keep as warm as possible. We finally made it there, red faced, and ready to order some hot tea. The waitress was impressed that we were willing to walk over in such cold weather! We took a chance and ordered something that we had never had before, and out came the most delicious sushi we had ever consumed! We agreed that this was our new favorite place, and we were so happy that it was right next to our apartment! It was also so nice that we were cuddling in public, as normally we are very shy and don't like any sort of public displays of affection. It was a new milestone for our relationship, and we are even closer now, casting aside our fears and starting to do things like hug and hold hands in public! I had such a wonderful anniversary and I'm very happy that we get to bond more and more every year! :)",,3LQ8PUHQFME103IH5BVGDNY3NSDHIK
