The most memorable part of the purchase is who I purchased it from.     When I was a child I lived in the mobile home park and my friends parents had one of the newest mobile homes in the park. I liked their trailer when I was a kid. When I moved back here as an adult I quickly realized that the same people who were here from my childhood 35 years ago were still here. One family that was still here was the family that had the (back in the day) newer trailer. Now the trailer is old and dilapidated. So, when I came back, I purchased the largest trailer in the whole park. I put it back together and sold it after about 3 years. I chose a new trailer in another city to start remodeling on. I got to the final details of the transaction and the woman who owned it did not get her stuff out on time for me to hand my completed trailer over to the new owner. So, I searched frantically for another home. That's when I discovered that the family I had known as a child had recently listed their trailer for sale. I quickly purchased and moved.      I'm almost done remodeling the vintage trailer now. The parents of the kids I hung out with as a kid stop by and check out my progress every few weeks. It's kind of fun to share with them the remodeling of the trailer.",,3LQ8PUHQFME103IH5BVGDNY3X5LIHT
