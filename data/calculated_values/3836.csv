And while this may be true, These feelings were mixed with those of regret and fear. Fear of the unknown in the new chapter of my life I was about to enter, the workforce. This is why we work so hard to get into Harvard , right? Still, there's always that anxiety when welcoming drastic change in life, and this may be the most drastic change of mine. I only wish I could have gotten to know my fellow classmates better. I'll never know, but I feel like there were lifelong friendships that could have been had if I put myself out there. And as I was on that stage I'll never forget how excited I saw all my peers, i'm sure each story they had to tell was just as exciting. I won't give the excuse of how busy I so frequently was, or how my involvement with band made things that much more unlikely. Speaking of band, I've had so many good and bad stories to tell. My most memorable would have to be while performing at a tournament. One of the band teams was so off their own instructor quit mid performance! I felt sorry for that group, it was so embarrassing to watch. We on the other hand got second place among stiff competition. That speaks to how close we are as a group and how in sync we were. When I was in band I never felt out of place, quite the opposite. So as I looked again at that stage and see everyone whose name was called I can't help but wonder, could I have formed just as strong a connection to he and she. I guess I'll never know, what I was sure of though was the next chapter in my life I would make the most of it.",,3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVR2AFZ2J
