I don't even know why. It's still been pretty recent, one month, from when it happened. I felt, at the time, that I had to tell him something, I guess. An old friend of mine's Mother had passed away. While he was torn about the whole thing, it made me think about the times I spent with her. She took good care of me even though I wasn't technically family and we had a lot of good times together. That was a long time ago, though, and that probably made it easier for me to settle with the fact that I could not even make time to attend her funeral. I was surprised by how he handled my rejection well enough, but also how I was even able to accept it afterwards. I guess I'm realizing a part of myself that lacks the empathy that I wish I had. So, running through events quickly in my head, I probably was thinking about the significance or connection I had to the event but instead should have been thinking about how my friend would feel about my attendance. I think this event gave me a good perspective on what I am and what I think I should become. I need to be able to hold the people that I care for, and the people that care for me, closer than I do. Maybe there was really no way I could attend the funeral. Maybe I couldn't repay the people I love. But, I think I could have realized and felt that what I had done was unusual.",,32N49TQG3H4RCMU3YCK7BQ1TQPPAVT
