I planned to run a total of three mile today. I started my run normal as usual with a little back paint to my lower back. I ran enough to warm up and get rid of the pain. While running I noticed a woman walking the same path but in opposite direction. I said hello and kept on running. Im not into chubby women however, this one caught my attention for some reason. So, every time that I passed by her I would say something. Trying to get her to talk. We had brief conversations. When I say brief I mean really brief. I should have asked her for her name. I did not. If i were to ever run into this person again. I might ask her for her name. She was supper pretty.",,3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVRU3V2ZG
