My cousin Anna, who I hadn't spoken to in years, was getting married. Our families notoriously hated each other, so I guess this was her attempt at an olive branch. At first I wasn't going to go. But then I talked it over with my mother and she thought it would be a good idea to attend. She said when I was younger Anna and I were very close and that Anna probably missed me. I sent the RSVP back saying I would attend with my boyfriend. I was pretty nervous walking into the reception. I hadn't seen many of these relatives in at least 5 years. Some of them had big fights with my mother. I wasn't sure what everyone thought of me. I quickly found my seat and sat down so I could observe the room. I noticed right away that everyone was drinking heavily. I figured it was in my best interest to stay sober. The night proceeded without any issues. I talked to my cousin, it was great to see her. I also talked to a few aunts and uncles that I hadn't seen. No one mentioned my mother, which was great.  At the end as I was walking out I watched as one of my aunts vomited all over the table. I couldn't wait to tell that part to my mom!",,3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVRUNEZ20
