It was a very nice, sunny day. I saw a little dog wandering around. He looked like he was lost. He also seemed very hungry. I happened to have a cracker in my pocket, so I gave it to him.  He seemed so appreciative of it, licking and kissing me. I let him follow me home so I could feed him. I already had a dog at home, so I had some food there. My dog and the lost dog were instantly friends. The new dog made himself right at home, and he has been there ever since. I did post an ad online about the dog in case someone was missing him. I was happy to be able to keep him after no one claimed him. I could not imagine life without him. He was the piece we never knew was missing from our family until we found him that day.",,3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQC9LAAKM
