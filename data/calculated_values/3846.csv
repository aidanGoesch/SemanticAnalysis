Not really going anywhere in particular.  I saw a puppy run across the road in the distance, so I pulled over.  I was worried that he might be hit by a passing car because rush hour was coming soon.  When I got near him he ran right up to me, he wasn't scared at all.  Had to be someone's pet.  I picked him up and walked to the closest house, hoping that he was theirs.  He wasn't so I checked some more houses in the neighborhood.  Nobody seemed to have ever saw him.  Or wanted to claim him.  He seemed in good health and didn't have fleas so I took him home.  My other dog seemed to fall in love with him.  I took him to the vet the next day to have him checked and he had a good bill of health.  I had it in my mind that I would put him up for adoption.  Well, that never happened  and that's how I wound up with another dog.",3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQC9LAAKM,
