Several weeks ago I had hated talking about mushrooms that make you feel wonderful, they make you use sub-regional things while transporting you for a period of time to a parallel world where you are the King. When I heard it, I felt very intrigued and excited about how it was or how I felt trying these substances and experiencing their effects on me.Â Until I found a person I recommended that if I was going to do it I needed to drink orange juice and chocolate in case that as they say my ""trip"" is not as good as expected. I dared to do it I went and bought the mushrooms and apart from that a lot of chocolate and orange juice to prevent things from going wrong, I came to my house and turned on the stove I boiled water and prepared a magic tea with psilocybin mushrooms. I was very excited to know what effects it would have on my body, after the tea was ready I sat in my chair, and for a few minutes while I waited for it to cool a little, I thought about my life, and how crazy it is to do this to Conventional people like most people in the world. After a few minutes that my cold cooled, I drank it almost completely, while I could feel it, the effects were beginning to emerge on my body, and when I finished almost completely my tea, I had the best and craziest experience in my lifetime. I left my apartment and headed with the effects of mushrooms to a park, and I could see everything with sharpness and colors too bright, people looked different than I usually see them. There was happiness everywhere, then further steps I could see a tree with violet leaves was something incredible, everything was so colorfully beautiful. Without a doubt I could enjoy that experience to the fullest after this, I began to feel a little dizzy and uncoordinated it was there when I knew that I had to do something to stop the effect, unfortunately I had to say goodbye to that colorful and beautiful city and see again The somber city of always. I ate chocolate with a good glass of orange juice and the effects started to go down, but something unexpected happened when the effects were removed and it was that my eyes opened and I managed to see and understand the good things of the world, the good things of me .I understood at that moment that this was my true self, a happily crazy person who lived submerged in a world of complete happiness and total freedom. It should be clarified that before, when I was a little younger, I suffered a lot of contempt from my friends at school, this brought to my life what they read now, an even better person, freed from any external opinion other than mine. And without a doubt today I feel much better with myself than ever, I can feel comfortable with what I do, I am not afraid to do any madness. After this I can gladly experience this sensation so wildly, it was a great pleasure for me. Fin.",,3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQCL8CAKA
