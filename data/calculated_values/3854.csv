It was sometime in July/August, and it was the first time I had tried something truly magical. This magical experience I had was due to me eating a few grams of Psilocybin mushrooms. It was sometime at night, and I had just gotten everything I needed to try them. I planned on making a tea out of the mushrooms, I read somewhere on Reddit that if you boil water and let the mushrooms sit in the hot water all of the bad alkaloids that cause nausea wont be there and that the effects wont be as strong. Anyways, after brewing the tea I decided that I should sit down and start enjoying my freshly brewed magical tea. About halfway through the cup, I felt butterflies building up in my stomach. I think it was just my nerves getting to me, but I was starting to feel pretty anxious about the whole situation. I did not know what I should be feeling or what to even expect. I decided to lay down, and not finish the tea. This is when the effects begin to really kick in, it had been about 45 minutes since I made the tea. It's hard to describe how I physically felt, but I think the best way to describe it is that I had absolutely no energy to get up. I was glued to my bed. Instantly I started to get very introspective, thinking about literally everything and anything. I was thinking about all the times I got angry, all the times someone did something for me, I started thinking about all my family members. It truly was a remarkable experience, as it showed me that all the problems I thought I had weren't really problems at all. I felt as I had complete control of the world around me, I felt connected to everything and all of my everyday stresses vanished just like that. Nothing mattered at that moment, this overwhelming experience of freedom brought tears to my eyes. I could not stop crying these tears of joy, I don't think I ever felt so free and happy then I have at that moment. I remember telling myself to right down all of these feelings because I did not want to forget about this moment. The next day I felt an overwhelming glow about myself, and I just wanted to help everyone around me. This experience for me was very memorable, and brought a lot happiness into my life.",,3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQCL8CAKA
