This happened over the summer, and was very memorable to me because I went with my children. We have never been to the fair before, so my children were very exited. Looking at all the majestic rides, the regret on spending so much money instantly flew out the window. While we were walking around, they headed off to the first ride, and I stayed behind with my mother and my 2 years old son who is too young for any of the rides. After about 30 minutes, my children came back, all giddy and happy . My second daughter asked for some cotton candy, and we went over to buy some. I wished I had went on one of the rides, but it was very late in the night. As my daughters walked over to the Ferris Wheel, I walked over with my 10 year old son to the Ice ride. The line was extremely long, but in the end he loved the ride  and wanted to go again. This moment was very memorable to me because I was able to watch my children have fun and the event was a very nice outing. My daughters had finally returned from the Ferris Wheel, and I encouraged them to ride the Ice ride. They rode on, and getting off they excitedly talked. Since it was very late in the night, my family and I decided to call it a night. We took some pictures, then drove off to Burger King. When we got home, I told my husband about the events. He was very happy we had fun. I myself was happy and glad that I spent the money I did. It was nice for us us to go to the fair as a family for the first time.",,3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQCLB6AKA
