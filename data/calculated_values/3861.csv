It was like a dream I had been waiting to come true for awhile now. About 3 months ago I got a raise and a promotion at my job. But today was great because I started working on my own, my training is finished and I can move forward in my new job. Before then I was feeling really down and possibly looking for a new employer. I didn't feel like I was making the progress I would like to in my job. I didn't feel noticed. I had briefly mentioned my wanting to move up the corporate letter to my boss during a review, but I didn't see a promotion coming along anytime back then. To my surprise Becky the HR coordinator called me to her office out of the blue around 3 months ago, and along with my department manager Will they discussed that I was being promoted and that my salary was going up substantially. I was shocked. I think I might have almost cried when they first brought it up to me. They told me that it would be a rather long training schedule for the new position as they wanted me to succeed in my new position. I didn't quite know what to expect. Several months later here I am leading my own team. I am confident. I am happy to come into work everyday. I am glad that I put in the effort to move forward in my career. I can't wait for my next chance to climb to the ladder further.",,3LS2AMNW5GCO9ISNMWVF6YMQXI7QOE
