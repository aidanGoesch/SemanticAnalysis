It was very surprising. I did not expect my salary to increase 20 percent. I also did not expect to have two competing offers within the same company. This event was significant to me because it set me up financially to take care of my family. I am now in a place where my wife and I are able to afford a home. We have been renting for so long. We want our children to grow up with a yard. It also makes me feel more secure in my job. I now know that I do not have to fear a lay-off. I am in control of my destiny. I am positioned for success. It is nice seeing my hard work payoff. I am happy in my new role but part of me is longing for more. I have already starting looking towards my next promotion.,3LS2AMNW5GCO9ISNMWVF6YMQXI7QOE,
