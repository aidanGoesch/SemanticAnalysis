Well, here we go with the explanation.  I kept going to my usual doctor and he kept doing the usual:  telling me to lose weight and stop smoking.  Anyway, as you know a few months ago, he wasn't in the office on my appointment day and I ended up just seeing his P.A.  She ordered some more detailed lab work because she was actually concerned about everything I was describing.  Well, the blood tests came back (as you already know) and she called me and wanted to refer me to a hematologist.  Went and saw the blood-doc a month ago.  Why so long?  Well, it takes forever to get in to see these guys around here.  Anyway, the new doctor, Margaret, took more blood and I just got the results a couple of weeks ago.  It seems that I have a little genetic problem and that resulted in being diagnosed with a pretty rare form of leukemia.  It's called Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia or CMML.  She also said that I have a specific sub-type, CMML-2.  This is NOT good!  Hell, I'm only 52 and now I'm being told that with a lot of totally miserable treatment, I MAY have 2 -5 years left to live.  Maybe more if I can qualify for stem cell transplant.  Heh, I may even get as many as 8 years.  This isn't fair at all, if you want my personal opinion!  My wife and I still have 2 children at home.  Sarah is 13 and Mary is only 11.  We have to tell them what's going on and it's gonna absolutely destroy them.  Oh, and I should tell you that we just recently got good news as well (well, good is a relative term, haha!)!  We're expecting again!  I may be 52, but you know that Em is 18 years younger than me as well.  She's hoping that maybe our expecting another baby will give me even more reasons to hang on and live to see this new child.  I don't know how I'm going to handle this!!",,3LS2AMNW5GCO9ISNMWVF6YMQYCQOQK
