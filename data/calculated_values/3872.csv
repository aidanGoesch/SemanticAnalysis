We always tried to be on one, but it always seemed to slip away. But today, that dream was finally realized. I took my entire family on a carribean cruise vacation. It was really the happiest day of my entire life. There were a lot of families aboard, which was an added bonus. Both tim and hanna got the company of other kids. I saw them happily build friendships with other children while exploring the cruise on their own. After years i felt relaxed and laid back. I felt like i could pamper myself. The trip was especially valuable for our marriage. Jon and i got to spend quality time together. It had been a long time for us since last time we did. He even gifted my a pearl necklace. I wish this day would never end.",,3LWJHTCVCD8U35FUNTCPJ4DC0VGQFF
