We loved every moment of it. We enjoyed visiting the ports we stopped at and learnt a lot about these places. My favorite stop was Curacao. The town is so pretty and colorful and has so much history and stuff to offer the visitors. Also, we got to swim with turtles here. I must admit, that was my personal favorite thing. We also got to know a few nice people on the boat including our waiters and room stewards. All-in-all, this was a very memorable vacation for our whole family. My kids both loved their program and wanted to stay with their friends all day. Which was kind of nice for me and my husband too as we got to spend so much time together and connect like we could never back at home with our busy schedules. Since we were returning guests with Carnival and celebrated our anniversary on the boat we got some nice perks from guest services. We got free bottles of water and a few free drinks at the bar. The food was great every night and it was easy to get into the dining room. Carnival has a new app that you can use to text and reserve tables in the dining room etc. It is very easy to use and handy. The whole experience was very pleasant and we all would go back in a heartbeat.",3LWJHTCVCD8U35FUNTCPJ4DC0VGQFF,
