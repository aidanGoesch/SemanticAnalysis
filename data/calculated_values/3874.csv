It was a fantastic time bonding with my family. We went on an 8 day 7 night cruise to the South Caribbean out if Miami. The stateroom was clean and spacious and we even had 2 bathrooms. I have never seen that on any ship before. The food was great. We ate something different and tasty every day but we also had out favorites that we went back to as well. The shows were fun and other entertainment was great too. My son made some friends that he is still talking to. The best part of course was that we spent the whole time together and had some real good conversations and bonding time. My favorite part was swimming with turtles in Curacao. That memory will stay with me till the end of my life for sure. I also enjoyed watching my kids explore new things. My little girl had lots of un with new experiences and my 12 year old had a great time building friendships. It was nice to see him getting out and building social skills.,3LWJHTCVCD8U35FUNTCPJ4DC0VGQFF,3LWJHTCVCD8U35FUNTCPJ4DC0VGQFF
