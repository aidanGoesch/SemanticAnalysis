One of the best days of my life and everything i had ever hoped for. The days went by slow but the weeks went fast, finally the day has come where i can say im done with school for the rest of my life. My family and my friends were all there to congratulate me on this achievement.  I promised my fiance and my newly born daughter hailey that her dad would finish and not quit like in the past. I wanted to show her how much hard work and time goes into making a difference in your life and i wanted to make them both proud. I want to be the best father and for her to have a good role model that shows that when things get tough you dont just quit. As i walked across that staged and got my diploma it was surreal. It felt like that moment would never come,all the long nights and hard classes have came to this conclusion and i did it. My parents took us out to eat after to celebrate. Im older than my brother yet he graduated college first because i skipped a few years. Life doesn't always go as planned and it doesn't always go the same for everyone but you do your best thats all you can ask yourself. I feel so blessed to have had the chance to go to college and finish. I have accomplished my goal to make my family and friends proud and most importantly i made myself proud. i never thought i could do it but i did. Till next time.",,3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAI3QVKBD
