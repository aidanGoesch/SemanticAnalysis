Honestly, we ignored him because he tends to be dramatic and he seemed fine. Then one day he started feeling these sharp pains in his chest so he went to the hospital. We all expected he'd be home later, we didn't expect he would be in the hospital for 3 weeks. It turns out my dad had a heart attack a few days before going to the hospital. He has had heart attacks before, he had minor surgeries as a result, and he was fine. This time it wasn't that easy. He had some tests done the next day and it was discovered he had severe blockages in his heart. He needed 5 bypasses performed. To say my family was shocked would be an understatement. I remember I was driving my mom to the hospital to visit him and we still didn't know what was wrong. My dad called and said something about surgery. Emergency surgery, we didn't really understand what he was saying. When we finally got to his bedside it was explained to us how serious the situation was. He might not survive. He might survive but die soon after anyway, due to his age and smoking history. I remember this day so vividly because it was the day I really had to face the reality that my Dad might not live much longer. It was the day his ""Superman"" exterior really started to crack. He was scared. I'd never seen my dad scared. We were all scared, it was the beginning of a very long and emotional month for me and my family.",3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIJJ7BKI,3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIJJ7BKI
