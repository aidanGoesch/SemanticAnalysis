Since she was a little baby i was waiting for this moment, because she has a personality that makes me feel like I have my sister back when she was young. That is regarding because for several reasons my sister is not longer along with us, and she is like the memory we have about my sister. Now why that date was so important for me? Well, I am no exactly in my home country. I am living abroad because of my career, but for that date I wanted to jump from my place to her place, just because i cannot miss that once in a life event for my niece. I overpay a flight ticket, i layover for about 12 hours ins another country, i got event sick because of the meal, but you know what?, i don't regret at all. At the end of the day i saw her face, i saw how happy she was in her party celebration, and also she was happy to see me there. I could dance with my little niece, which is such my little baby as well , and i will remember that for the rest of my life. I said to her that when i was in the airplane, i saw her mother in the sky, she told me to carry her, and said i love you in behave of her. My niece was so happy, she hug me and i whisper: your mother is so proud of you honey. I am pretty sure my sister was also dancing in the heaven. The night was too short, but the memories are infinites, because each second was valuable. I have to travel back the next day, without anything in my bags, but my heart full of love. Family is the treasure that will always makes your life valuable.",,32N49TQG3H4RCMU3YCK7BQ1TRANAVY
