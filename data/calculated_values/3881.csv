I thought I would have a few more years before it was needed. I scheduled the surgery on one of my eyes first. The other eye would have surgery later after the first one healed. I was so nervous the day of surgery. I was fortunate to have a family member with me because you can't have the surgery without someone being there. Everyone at the surgical center was very nice and tries to put you at ease. I had an eye exam before the surgery to confirm the type of lens to be used. I was prepped for surgery with a mild anesthetic. It's a very strange feeling to be awake for the surgery. I was very much aware of what the surgeon was doing which was a big surprise to me. I could feel everything, but there wasn't pain with the actual surgery. I was surprised that I was able to talk to the surgeon and staff. It was a very strange sensation to know when the lens was being replaced. I was very glad when it was finished even though it didn't take very long.",3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIUWBBKN,
