I wanted to take her. However it's tough for us because we don't have a lot of money these days. I talked to her about it and told it would take a while to save. I did all I could and saved up a ton of money. It took a lot of extra work. I put forth a lot of extra effort in my job and put in extra hours. I also sold some things that I had laying around the house on Ebay. Finally I had enough money and I asked her where she wanted to go. She said she wanted to do a beach vacation. We looked at different beaches. We thought about Florida. Finally we decided on Orange Beach, Alabama. It was a great place. We had a ton of fun while we were there. She was very happy and thankfully for all that I had done for her.",3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34D63BBWZ,
