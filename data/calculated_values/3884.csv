I spoke to here and asked her what it would take. I knew she had been depressed recently. She said to me that we need to go on vacation. I agreed with her. I spent the next few weeks trying to save money. I worked a side job. I sold a few thing around the house. Finally after all the work I had enough money for us to go on a good vacation somewhere. We talked about it and we decided to go to Dollywood for a few days. We drove there because it's only a few hundred miles. We rented a nice hotel nearby the park. It was a lot of fun for us there. We rode a lot of rides. We had a good time looking at all the attractions. It was a very relaxing and fun time for us.,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34D63BBWZ,
