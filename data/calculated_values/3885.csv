He was clearly devastated, and obviously I also felt bad for him. I was also mad because it seamed like his was abusive and controlling. It's like if he was her property. I tried to convince him of leaving her. He is somehow attached to this person that just hurts him. It is unbelievable how bad it can get with a controlling person and a submissive one. Even though I feel bad form my friend I also feel betrayed by him. He is a drug addict and he never told me. We were suppose to be really good friends. However, I'm not going to freak out, I'll just try to help him like a good friend would do.  I am going to do this, also, because i am in love with him. I was always in love with him. However he married someone else and that  was the end of it. But now, now I'm going to take my chance and I'll try to be happy with the man that makes me happy.",,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34D7Q6WBQ
