It was to merge some of our databases in order to sell them to an important business partner. We had been working on it for over a month now and the deadline was nearing. We got to work the next day and nothing seemed out of the ordinary. Then we finally got ready to start our work for the day and were met with a terrible surprise. All of our work was gone. We don't know what exactly happened to it, but it appeared to have been deleted somehow. We were all absolutely devastated by this revelation. Some people panicked and others just sat there in disbelief. We tried to gain our composure and thought about what to do next. Somebody thought to go to IT and ask if there was a way to revert our systems back to when the work was still there. When we got to the IT office, they told us that it would depend on when the work was deleted, because they only store previous states for so long. So then we waited for what seemed like an eternity, but was maybe an hour or two. Ring ring! Our team leader picked up the phone. They looked concerned, but then their stoic face gained a smile. The work was recovered. We were all ecstatic. We learned the important lesson of being careful and backing up our data, as well as keeping calm under pressure. It was a very important day in all of our careers.",,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34DH3KWB4
