Me and my colleagues tried our best to sort it out immediately as we were running out of time to complete the project. I felt so bad as i promised to complete the project on time. My colleagues too were trying their best to solve the error but it was not happening. Suddenly i got an idea that, ""We should  keep aside the issue and think about possible solutions"". So i insisted on having an hour break for time being. Everyone had enough time to think on the solutions in a relaxed environment. Once they returned back,everyone came with different solutions. We discussed all the solutions and found the solution we were looking for at ease . Everything got solved all of a sudden. Finishing project on time was a great experience and a big surprise too. It was a wonderful day for everyone. This incident also taught us very big lesson on ""how we should handle each issue with team effort"".I too was very much satisfied that my idea worked out with less effort on right time. On top of this incident, we were able to identify our strengths. We cherished a lot as the project brought a big reputation to our team. I was very much overwhelmed by our teamwork.",,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34DH3KWB4
