He was such a sweet boy, and lived a good, long life.  Tucker was like my son; he made me laugh and made me happy.  I got Tucker from a shelter when he was  only 5 months old.  At that time, he was a bit of a street urchin.  He was always into mischief, and occasionally required time outs in my bedroom.  That was part of his charm.  I always dreaded Tucker's growing old and I prayed he would just go in his sleep some day.  That was not to be.  He became ill, and it turned out he had kidney failure.  Once I knew that, the decision was easy.  I never wanted Tucker to suffer.  The decision was easy, but the act was not.  I held him while the vet did her thing, and he quietly passed in my arms.  One of the saddest things to do.   I cried, my two daughters and their significant others all cried.  Tucker was so loved.  I was glad that he was no longer suffering, but I missed him so much.  Still do.  I still cry when I think of him.  But I wouldn't do anything differently.",,3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3MMKZ52
