I can't control what my brain does either. It's very scary but extremely exciting at the same time. During my last mania my brain decided that I should check out some ads online for sex with strangers. I had very little ""luck"" but did finally hook up with a stranger who I gave my phone number and address to. We started meeting a couple times a day for a few weeks until I found out a few things about him. This was shortly after my mania subsided and I was thinking properly again. First of all, he was being drug tested for cocaine. I know he didn't work so I can only assume it was for probation or parole. When I found that out I asked him if he was an IV drug user. He said no, but his girlfriend was a heroin IV drug user. First of all, in my right mind I would never meet up with anyone who had a significant other. Secondly, it's not even in my nature to  have sex with someone I wasn't intimately involved with. So I told him I was uncomfortable with the situation. After that, he became verbally abusive and threatened violence. It lasted about a month until I finally changed my phone number so the harassment would stop. Part of the problem was that he knows where I live so I had to be very cautious when leaving the apartment building. It's getting better now but it is still in the back of my mind.",3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3O90Z5U,
