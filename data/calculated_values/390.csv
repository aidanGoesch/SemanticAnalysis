We went to King's Island. My son is five, but large for his age (big enough to go on every ride in the ""Kiddie"" part of the park), but he has a developmental disorder, with issues predominantly centered around attention and language.  This has given him some social delays as well - and so often in exciting places (like an amusement park) it can be tough to maintain his attention on something that I want him focused on.   Also, there are times when he doesn't have the language to communicate his needs or express what he's thinking about.   Despite this, he's adventurous and likes to try new things, so going to an amusement park is sort of ""up his alley"" but also a type of situation that can give me anxiety due to the language and attention challenges. This trip was amazing.  My son was completely excited and had the time of his life.  We had worked on the word ""brave"" and he continued to use this term to describe himself at the park.  He'd go up to one of the kiddie rides and express that he was going to be brave and then I'd watch him just rise to the moment.  I'll be honest, I'm getting emotional just remembering the look on his face when he was utterly terrified of a ride, wanted to be on it, and didn't want me to ride it with him.  He told me he was going to be ""Brave"" and the determination and maturity as he faced his fear, and handled it was amazing.   And beyond that, the pride he had when he got off that little ride fills my heart.  There were some language difficulties, when I was asking him about some of the adult rides, ""What do you think of that one?  That looks big! That looks scary.""  He clearly misunderstood my intentions and got into a panic, becoming really scared and shouting ""I don't want to ride it!""    He calmed down when my wife explained that she wasn't going to make him get on the big rides.   Although, honestly, he gave me a skeptical look as if to say, ""You won't Mom, but I dunno about Dad...."" He was amazing, and it was a fantastic experience this summer.  It helped us see how far he had come in his development and with his language use.",,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G36N8EK7
