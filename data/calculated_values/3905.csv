It was like working for a zoo with angry and slow animals. Or better description is a reality show with catty people. If they did not like some one they tried to get you fired . They did this with me on more than one occasion. Thank god they are not the brightest banana's in the bunch. I was able to catch them and call them out. The manager were also all rude among other things. They would talk down to the guests and make them feel unwelcome. I was getting really tired of that situation. I had to get out before i got into trouble or worse. So I believe I did the right thing and quit. I am having a really hard time finding another job. I know though that with time I will find a good one I can enjoy. Hopefully one with benefits.,,3M1CVSFP61RZ7EYMCDQX532LAM2AQ6
