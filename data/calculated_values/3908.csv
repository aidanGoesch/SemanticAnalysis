She had some free play at a local casino and asked me to stop on my way home and meet her there. Sounded like a fun plan as I always liked the casino and usually had a pretty good time. If I won some money I could stop and have dinner in Raul's restaurant. All in all it could make for a fun evening. As I drove there in 5 o'clock traffic I began to notice how crowded the area was, I had forgotten about a large convention that was in town. I arrived ,found a good place to park and headed into the casino to locate my wife. Soon I located her and she was winning . A few minutes in my friend Jim  just happened by ! A complete coincidence! WoW! Jim was planning on eating at Raul's would we like to join him ? Sure ! We played the slot machine for a few minutes and the walked toward the restaurant. Jim had reservations so there was no wait. The Host called us and we were walked to a small room at the back of the restaurant. When the door was opened there were my friends from work, from the neighborhood and school.""SURPRISE""  was shouted by everyone. There was a big cake, a table full of presents, What a surprise ! I had forgotten it was my birthday! Soon the music started out came the dancing girls! Man can my wife plan a party !",,3M23Y66PO3TAXS1WE4YQKYF0PKE6SX
