My husband was going through plenty pain and experiencing bad things health wise. Due to the fact that my husband had to have surgery and I was unemployed, I had to double my efforts to find employment, as we had very little saved up. I really had to work hard to get everything that we had. I tried to find work any and everywhere to get some money. I went through a time of depression and my relationship with my husband deteriorated a little because of it. I really downed me even more. That was someone that was really important to me. we spent a siginificant amount of time together. we really knew each other and could get along very well. I didn't know what to think when I realized our relationship lost some touch. I couldn't get myself together for a while. so eventually I did get my life together and I and to understand things change. I couldn't keep downing myself about hard situations. I had to push through and live happy every day to get the most out of it.",,3M23Y66PO3TAXS1WE4YQKYF0V0I6S3
