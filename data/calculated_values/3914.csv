It started when my cat vomited constantly for a full day. I knew something must have been wrong but hoped it would turn out okay since I couldn't afford a vet at the time. However, he didn't improve. For days after, he couldn't keep food down. He eventually stopped eating entirely and stayed in one place all day. Once he urinated on himself instead of getting up to get to his box, I knew I needed to do something so I wrapped him in a towel and took him to the local vet. Kidney failure. That's what she said was wrong with him. They would give him medication and monitor him to see if he got better and I was told I didn't have to pay up front. He improved after three days. I got to take him home and he sat in my lap all day. Then I was awakened in the middle of the night. He was convulsing. A seizure. Then another. And another. Every ten minutes. I took him back and explained what had happened. They took him in again and said they would watch him. I went to work. A phone call. Even if they could stop the seizures, brain damage was so severe that he wouldn't be the same. They recommended euthanization. I couldn't leave work to be there when it was done.",,3M23Y66PO3TAXS1WE4YQKYF0XPCS6Z
