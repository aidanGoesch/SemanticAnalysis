We both enjoy playing games, so we started playing one together. I got to talking to her and realized  that I really like her. We have a lot in common and she's super sweet. We decide to start dating each other online. She likes in another country though, which is kinda hard. But I took some time off and went to visit her. She showed me around and we went out on dates and had a great time. I got to know her even better. She's awesome and we had such a wonderful time together. We are going to meet up again soon. If things go well, one of us is planning to move to be with the other one. I think I might choose to be the one to move, in that case. I'm so happy. Things went so well.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA40AQ6RL
