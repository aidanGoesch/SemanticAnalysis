I thought it was so sweet of them. I always think it's nice when people make an effort to remember things that are important to you. For my party, they had all my favorite foods. That was great since I love to snack! The music was good too. I saw a lot of people I knew and that made me happy. I love being surrounded by friends. I'm definitely a ""people person"". Birthdays are important to me since I love celebrating. I don't even mind that I'm celebrating getting older. As long as it's fun, it's good for me. I didn't celebrate my birthday much after I graduated college. Mostly because I worked such demanding jobs. But I have a less stressful job now. And I can celebrate!",3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA40F86RD,
