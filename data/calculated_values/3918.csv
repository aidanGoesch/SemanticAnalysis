It made me so happy that they remembered and thought it was a special occasion. They told me to come to my friends apartment to celebrate. I showed up and there were all the special people in my life. I was so grateful. It was a special movement for me. They had lots of food set up, including all of my favorites. The music was good. I kept walking around the room hugging everyone. Last year I didn't have a very good birthday. So this meant a lot to me. We were there for a long time. It was dark when we finally went home. I'm grateful to have such good friends. They make my life better.",3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA40F86RD,
