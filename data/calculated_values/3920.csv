Her pregnancy wasn't to hard, she'd been caring her child well until the last week of birth. I remember when I was carrying her, I had to be induced because she was two weeks late. She was a trooper, all the family was with her as she gave birth. So many hours in labor but she didn't waver. and oh my goodness what a beautiful bundle she had. She was a small baby herself when I birthed her, but this child of her's, this baby boy was just the cutest you'd ever seen. He was long, lanky and absolutly screaming when he arrived. There were four generations in the room that day. Great grandmom, Grandmom, me and my husband, her parents, her younger brother, husband and her step kids. So many people. But it was so worth the wait of this baby bundle. She was such a trooper, all the pain was taken in stride as we all took turns holding my daughters hand and helping her through it all. I just can't imagine everything that was going through her mind. I know when I was giving birth to her I was thinking about everything I'd teach this precious child. Maybe that was happening throughout the whole ordeal. I know she'll make the best mother ever, and this child will be the luckiest child to have such a loving mother. My daughter was the most loving daughter there was for me, I can only imagine just how much joy that son will bring her. She's such an amazing woman.",3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA48V36RC,
