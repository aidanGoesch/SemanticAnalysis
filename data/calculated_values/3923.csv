I was so proud and so was my wife. But i got very emotional about it because seeing my son progress so fast, makes me proud to be a father. My father who recently passed, never got to meet his grandchild. Cancer took him away from us but i would like to think he's looking down on us. I hope he proud of me and his grandson. My main goal is to just be a great role model and father like my dad was to me and i hope he is proud of me. So when i see my son him take those first steps, i get a sense of pride and a sense of purpose in life. I wish my dad could of met him. My wife has been very supportive to me, she always helps me when she can. Our little bundle of joy is growing up so fast! its crazy how fast time flies! I often wonder if this feeling is the same my dad felt when he became a father. i would not trade anything at all for that feeling. I miss you dad.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA4ALIR6U
