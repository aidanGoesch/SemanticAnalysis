On the 2nd day of the month I found and removed two ticks from my back. Not thinking much about it I never really considered that they might have infected me. About four days later I started feeling bad and within a day had a raging fever. Great I thought, I've probably got the flu although it seemed a rather odd time of year to get the flu. I was very sick for 3 days and finally decided to go see a doctor. The diagnosis, a virus. Wait a couple days and if the fever doesn't get better, call them back. In two days I felt much better. Another week passes and suddenly I started getting this strange rash all over my body with a bulls-eye rash on my back at the tick bite site. I refused to believe it was serious and waited. Several more days passed and one night I developed a raging fever. This began to worry me and my wife was beside herself, emphatically trying to get me to see the doctor again. Finally I relented and made the call. The diagnosis this time was Lyme disease. My joints swelled, my head hurt and I was sick with a fever for several more days. The doctor prescribed antibiotics and in a couple days I began to improve. The process is slow though and I still have residual symptoms. Some people have these for months or even years. Only time will tell how my case proceeds.",,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRQJQBQX
