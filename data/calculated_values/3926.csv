Some time ago I guess she planned it out because it was a surprise for me. It was a trip to one of our favorite places to visit Costa Rica. We had visisted there before about two different times. We had a blast each time we went experiencing different things. It took us a few days to prepare for the trip but it seemed like it went by quick. We were really exicited to go our energy was so bright during that time. We already had planned out our finances. To be ahead of ourselves we saved a year's worth of income. We didn't have to do much else but pack clothes. Everything else was going to be purchased when we got there. After going to the airport and boarding our flight to costa rica things just continued to get even more exciting for us being that it was only a matter of time to get there. I am very thankful for my girlfriend she is everything to me. I now know why we have been together for five years.,,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRRD7QBI
