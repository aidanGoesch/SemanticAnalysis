As I was sure she couldn't be more thoughtful, loving, and kind, she surprised me with a weekend getaway to our favorite place. We woke up in the morning and exchanged words, kisses, and gifts, as we had officially been dating for 5 years! After we had woken up we made breakfast and sat and talked about what we should do for the day as we had our whole day free. She smirked and acted as if she had something to say but was holding back. After a moment it's as if she burst and with a wide grin she explained how she had a surprise planned and I had an hour to pack. Excited and nervous, I quickly threw clothes and necessities into a bag and before I knew it we were on our way! We drove into the city and on the way we listened to our favorite songs, laughed, and talked about our days' plans. We checked into the pre-booked hotel room and jumped on the bed. After settling in we left and explored the city. Although we've been to the city numerous times, it's always exciting to visit our favorite spots and look for things we'd missed or forgotten about. We ate plenty of great food, saw plenty of cute dogs (our favorite), and had a day full of love. It's always nice getting surprised and I was so taken back by her actually planning all of this without me knowing! She's not usually one to be able to keep a surprise so this was very out of character. Overall we had a great anniversary and the only thing that could top it would be an engagement... which is soon to come!",,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRRD7QBI
