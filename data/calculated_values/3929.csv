Me and my cousins used to ride bikes at old man Fischer's house. Fischer was a retired pest and varmint trapper with a sprawling estate and a nice paved drive that looped around his house and cut through the pines. My cousins were visiting during a Fourth of July party, and I reminded them in advance to bring their bikes. I can't help but feel responsible for the events that transpired. If I hadn't made the suggestion to ride bikes, none of this would've happened. Well, after dinner we rode over to Fischer's house and raced around his track. The sun was just about to set, and the sky was glowing brightly with orange and yellow. I rode my bike around a group of trees and my cousin Marty cut though an embankment just as my other cousin, Sue, reached down to fix her pedal. She didn't see it happen, but Marty lost control after his front tire his a rock and sent him flying over the handlebars and directly into Susie's face. Susie scrambled to her feet and screamed, with blood streaming down and gushing from her mouth. I went over to help her but she was flailing wildly. She struck me around the face and sent my glasses flying. They bounced off the side of old man Fischer's home and landed in such a way that the setting sun's light concentrated in one of the lenses and set fire to Fischer's home. His entire family perished in the inferno that day. Shucks, I wish I weren't such bad luck.",,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRS13BQC
