It doesn't feel like it. Months are gone, but his memories still lie with us. I wasn't that close, but it's still made a significant impact. I am still here today, and that's what matters. His death made me realize we can die at anytime and that if you want to do something, go do it. Because the next chance you get won't be the same one. That feeling you have of uncertainty, just do it. And if you fail, that's okay. At least you now know and you can move on. If you don't pursue that uneasy feeling, you're left with feelings of regret. And that's worse. So it doesn't matter what your circumstances are. If you see something you like, do it. If it makes you tense, do it. Give yourself a buffer to let all the nerves out, then go for it. Regardless of the outcome, you will become a better person for it.",3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRT24BQG,
