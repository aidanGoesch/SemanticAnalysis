We had been expecting this time to come any day now. Once it arrived, it was nearly impossible to prepare for! My wife was already in pain. I could see the look of anguish on her face. No amount of childbirth classes could prepare us for the real thing. And here it was! Staring us right in our faces. I quickly sprang into action. Jumping out of bed and nearly tripping down the stairs to start getting things ready. Or course it was the middle of the night, and everything was pitch black in our modest home. My wife was slowly making her way downstairs too, much slower than I. Before I could turn to help her on her decent, she let out a blood curdling scream. The baby was coming. And right this very second. I had no time to prepare. I helped her lay down on the floor and we both began all the steps we had been taught. At that moment, I truly new how powerful a woman was. Even though I felt her anguish remotely, I was in true awe. She was my hero as she brought our son into the world.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIE7VTNX4
