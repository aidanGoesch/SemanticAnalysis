Its happened  eight months but its still feels like yesterday. I could remember every thing as a clear as though it was yesterday. My mum literally means everything to my siblings and I. My dad had drinking problems he always beat my mum so my mum left with us. That every day was a special day for i and my siblings am the first of three. Dealing with her death wasn't an easy job for me especially cause i had to take full responsibility of my siblings. Mum had  been really sick for quite some time she had cancer. she was always sick every now and then. At a point I  sincerely thought she wont go through with it cause the sickness really did got to her really. I was scared at that some point . but on the day of her death was the worst of all I could literally see the light leaving her body that was how bad it was. I had doubt she was even actually gonna survive it. My siblings and i were with here i can remember her telling us how much she loved us. she told me specifically to take good care of my siblings if anything had happened to her. at this point in became really scared on how we were gonna survive. a little while she started struggling to breathe  my sibling called the nurses to come help us. I literally saw here took her last breathe. The picture is still really clear in my head it is a day i will literally never forget,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIE7VTNX4,
