I've always had a lot of anxiety. And when I went to college, it only got worse. My first roommate was a nightmare which didn't help. Then during my junior year, I actually had a really cool roommate. I sort of came out of my shell. We played D&D and I got to meet a whole new group of people. But even though I was having more social interaction, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety. Then one of the guys from D&D talked about how smoking week actually helped him with his anxiety. So I decided to give it a try. And it actually helped a little. That is until I got some bad stuff and ended up in the hospital. I mean I was totally freaking out. I don't know what was in it, but my anxiety went from bad to worse. I started having such bad panic attacks that I had to quit school and move back home.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEGOONXU
