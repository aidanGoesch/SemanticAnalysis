At the end of my lessons I usually chat a bit with my teacher, as it's difficult to fill up an entire half hour lesson with nothing but teachings about guitar and going over scales and such. During each lesson he gets me to play through whatever song or scale or technique he had been teaching me the week (or multiple weeks) earlier. This particular lesson while we were talking he paused for a moment and brought up that he'd noticed I was really struggling to learn a particular song, and that it had been ""beating me up"" for several weeks as I was attempting to learn it. I had been practicing the song a lot but I wasn't getting much better at it despite my best efforts, and I was concerned that it appeared to him that I wasn't actually practicing it enough due to my abilities not improving much over time. He remarked that he admired the fact that I was determined enough to keep sticking with it and carrying on despite how challenging it was for me to learn the song. He also told me that as he was old enough to be my father, he felt it was appropriate to tell me that he was very proud of me with how far I had come with learning guitar, and that he has many students who drop out after only a few months of taking lessons. I thanked him and was left a little bit speechless by his words, it was unexpected and it meant a lot to me that he was really seeing my progress over time - especially when I was worried because I myself wasn't seeing much of my own improvements. As I was leaving at the end of the lesson he reminded me to keep working at it and that I would eventually be able to play it, it would just take time. His comments renewed my desire to learn the song and I was motivated to continue learning it over the next few weeks. I got to a point where I was able to play it with minimal mistakes and better timing than before. I was quite touched by it because not many people are so genuine and open with their thoughts or compliments about others, and I don't often receive praise like that in my everyday life. It can be frustrating taking up a new hobby, especially if you're not good at it and to hear recognition that you're doing well and still progressing can alleviate some insecurities about your lack of ability. It can also motivate you more to keep pursuing it even if it is difficult. I am someone who grew up without a father figure in my life, and hearing such praise from someone I look up to and is a role model to me made it even more meaningful.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEGPPNXX
