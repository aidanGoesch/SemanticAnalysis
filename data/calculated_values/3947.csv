We had been to Paris before, but we were still very excited. We booked cheap flights that had a lot of stops and one of them was in Spain. Once we were in the Spanish airport, about 10 minutes before our gate was going to be announced, we received an email saying that our flight was cancelled. We didn't know it at the moment, but the gate we needed to go to in Paris was having some kind of unknown issue and a few flights were cancelled. Nobody at the airline seemed to know what was going on, and after hours of waiting in lines, talking to airline employees and pulling our hair out, we were herded onto a bus that was headed to Barcelona. It was about an 8 hour bus ride. We arrived at the Barcelona airport around midnight, but our bus driver had never been told what to do with us once we got there. We did about 5 laps around the airport while the driver waited for an answer from somebody, anybody. He eventually dropped us off at a terminal, drove off and left us there. Once again, no one at the airport knew what was going on and it took hours to get everything situated. We ended up sleeping on the floor of the airport, behind a customer service booth. We only got an hour of sleep before airport security woke us up and told us to move. Early in the morning we got our new flight. 2 hours later we landed in Paris, about 18 hours after we had originally planned. We had missed all of the pre wedding activities the night before, but managed to take a taxi to our AirBnB, shower, change clothes while still being able to arrive 15 minutes before the ceremony started. It was a beautiful wedding and despite the struggles and frustrating experiences we had in getting there, the time we had with our friends made it worth while.",3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEWMONX6,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEWMONX6
