I accepted a job with my kids school. I have been running an in home daycare for about 7 years now. While I love what I have been doing the days are getting longer. My kids are growing up faster than I could have expected. I was shocked when the school called and said they had a job they could offer me but it would only be part time. Now I am very excited to take on the challenge I really had to discuss with my husband if we could financially swing this. I make decent money right now but it doesn't allow me the freedom to just focus on my kids. This is a very important time in their lives as they figure out who they are and the type of people they will become. I feel as though what I have been doing worked for us while they were little but now they will both be in school full time, it is time for me to figure out what I want to do with myself as for as our future. I think working at their school has the perk of being able to work and being sure if they don't have school I don't have to work. We will have the same schedule  and be able to spend the one on one time I so crave. They are only little for so long and it is time to focus on them. I am very excited to start this new adventure. My family is excited and in only a few short weeks we will be adjusting to our new schedules. We can not wait to see what the future holds for us.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEYVSXN4
