I think there is a certain appeal. It's a rush of knowing earnings are possible. It's a risk but with high reward potential. But that's probably how they get you. A few months back I signed up for a lottery ticket. I bought it, and didn't really give it a second thought until weeks later. As it turns out, I had actually pulled a ticket that was worth a lot of money. So much so that it helps with bills. It was something I certainly didn't expect. I think it's best to approach it casually. Those who are avid goers risk a lot. It's not fair, but that's inherent to the game. It's fun, but high risk. I just hope that fortune strikes twice.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N3XPKLU
