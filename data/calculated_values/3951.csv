I had gotten into the habit of buying lottery rickets. Each week there are two drawings of the state lottery, Mega Millions and Power ball. In addition, I buy about 19-15 scratch off tickets a week. I always do quick pick, and am not in the habit of checking the tickets. I generally tack the tickets to a bulletin board in my study. When there are many tickets there, my partner usually asks me if I have checked them yet. When I am tired of hearing that question, I check the tickets using an app on my phone.  Last summer, I was lucky enough to win a few thousand dollars. I was very happy when I saw the ticket, and called the lottery offices  to get instructions about what to do to collect my winnings. I had to travel to a bigger city near me, and go to a lottery office. I filled out some forms, and they validated the ticket within 30 minutes.  My total after tax winnings were around $4000. Around that time I was  behind in my rent, so I believe that I used most of the money to get caught up. I felt very happy for about 3 days, and then this became an experience like any other.",3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N3XPKLU,
