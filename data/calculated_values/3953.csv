What a dream come true. I could not belive that this day was finally here. It was a dream come true. The odds were stacked against me but I knew that I could do it. As I thought back on my experiences, I remember it being a tough time but at the same time it was fun. Many people to me that I would not finish due to my family background. I was so glad that I showed all of the people that ever doubted me. I knew I could do It. When I first started I did not understand anything. I eventually got the hang of it and got through it. Now the fun really starts I get to find a really good job. I get to have that dream job of fixing any car that is broken. I'm hoping that the job is worth all the time I took to learn this work. All in all I say I did a great job!",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N422LKJ
