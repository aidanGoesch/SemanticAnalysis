It was a very strong moment of my life because I thought I was never going to meet a person, but this year things changed and I met the most wonderful woman in the world. This woman taught me the true meaning of what it is to love. I will always thank God because I feel he rewards me after such an outrageous event of my life. As the phrase says; After the storms come the rainbows and thanks to my new wife I feel that she will be the permanent rainbow of my life.Â I am living a full life with her, I can already say that I have become accustomed in such a short time. She clung to me as I clung to her. With my previous wife I always had difficulties, from the beginning but I always clung that things were going to go well but it was not so. That dark moment of my life gave me a lot of wisdom so that I would never trust another person again, but right now I feel more confident than ever with my new partner. Thank God for allowing me to meet her. Thanks to her for coming to my life at the worst time and above all, thanks to me for not decaying and giving me this new opportunity. In those days I felt alone, I went to the bars to drink a lot of beer. My family was telling me I was a failure. My friends didn't want to see me like that and they invited me to a party. This party was where I met the love of my life. Thanks friends!",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N5OIKL7
