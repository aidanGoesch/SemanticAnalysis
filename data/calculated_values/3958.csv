I had only been married a short time (under a year), but I asked for a divorce and separated from my then-wife. This separation occurred around the holidays, so it was especially lonely and depressing. Having to spend Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Years alone was a very dark thing to experience, very lonely. I had a great support system, and got myself into some healthy habits (gym, therapy, hobbies), but it was still an incredibly difficult time in my life. There were times when I wasn't sure things would ever get better. My divorce was finalized five months after separating, and I knew I needed to take the time to be single and get myself in a good place before I started dating again. As luck would have it, right when I started feeling like ""myself"" again, I met a wonderful woman. I am still with her to this day, and have a strong, fulfilling, and satisfying relationship. In the end, I learned that although I went through a dark time, all bad things will eventually pass as long as you're willing to put in the hard work to see them through. In going through the pain of a separation and divorce, I learned to appreciate not only myself, but my girlfriend. The little things she does seem so much more meaningful and important, because I came from a bad relationship where I had none of them. I now know what it's like to feel love and respected, but first, I had to learn to love and respect myself. That's something that could only come from recovering from a divorce. I hope my story ends up serving as an inspiring tale to those around me who don't believe there is light at the end of the tunnel.",3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N5OIKL7,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N5OIKL7
