We took him to the vet, but the vet wanted to put him down. it turned out he was not a good vet. We took the long back dog back home and cared for him. We visited a few other vets. They gave us better advice. We did therapy sessions with the dog. Eventually he started to show recovery signs. We are happy that he is recovering. He gets stronger every day. We are showing support in all ways. We help the dog physically. And also emotionally, by showing love. It goes a long way. He is happy and getting better. We are also very happy to see this happening.",,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3NZUKE4
