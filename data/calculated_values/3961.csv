It happened 4 months ago but it seem like an eternity. I like her husband and I glad for me. Nevertheless, they are so far away. They moved from North Carolina where she lived with us all the way to Canada. I think about the things we used to do everyday. For example, we used to go shopping together every week. We used to go to church together. I miss all these things. I miss her laughter and crazy sense of humor. I miss her facial expressions. I miss having her close to be able to run ideas by her. I miss her help around the house. I understand that I must let her go sometime. I just wish it wasn't so soon.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6NFK9KL0
