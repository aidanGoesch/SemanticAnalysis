My friend and I lived in a city, probably, I'd say, within a 10-15 minute walk from where I currently work. One day, on my way home from work, I noticed a house with a bunch of cars in the driveway, parked on the street, and some even in the yard. My blood began to boil immediately. See, the problem is, my friend wanted to live on his on, but most importantly, he needed to get out of his house. After having no luck I let him move in with me under a couple of conditions. The main one being, No Parties! No parties without consent, actually. So when I was walking home, tired, exhausted, and just ready to relax from work and saw all those cars.....I. Was. Pissed. Thanks to how stressful my job currently was I had run out of patients for the day. So I stormed up to the door, unlocked what turned out to be an already unlocked door, and walked into the house. To, not, my surprise, there was an ocean of people. I did know most of them oddly enough. People were smiling and saying something to me but I couldn't hear them through the anger. I rampaged through the house until I found my friend in the kitchen....standing next to a cake....that read, ""Happy Birthday! To the Best Friend a man can have.""Thank you, friend.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6NFOPKLO
