I think that to me, the event that was the most memorable was able to help a friend achieve one of his dreams. My friend has always wanted to be able to move out and live on his own since he graduated high school. I always love to help out friends whenever it is possible, but this situation was tougher than normal. I frequently would help him search for apartments for rent that were within his price range, but most of the time it was unsuccessful. Around 4 months ago, we had finally started seeing potential options. Once he finally found the potential one, we went and toured the complex. Everything had seemed to be going great, but we eventually found out that he would not be able to rent the apartment due to having no renters history. Now I already live in a different state than he does and I live on my own, so this gave me an idea. After giving it a lot of thought, I decided that I would offer to have him come live with me. At first, he had declined because he is not the type of person to accept handouts and he still would not technically be living on his own. I talked it over with him, and after a long conversation he accepted my offer. I've never seen him as happy as he was in that moment which really touched me. Since moving in with me, his quality of live and overall happiness have drastically improved. Even thinking back on that moment makes me emotional because i love seeing people extremely happy. Helping him out and having him move in with me has been one of the best decisions that either of us have made.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6NFOPKLO
