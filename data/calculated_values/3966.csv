I was his best man. I was handed over the family ring, and I was supposed to take care of it. I always used to keep it in my pocket in case I needed to show it to someone. One day it just skipped my mind, and I gave those pants to the laundry. After giving them up, I realized it had my brother's wedding ring. I was shocked and devastated. I went rushing to the laundry and asked the guy on the counter about my pants. I had lost all the hope that I would find it. He brought them to me, and I immediately checked its pockets. To my expectations, it was not there. However, the guy at the counter was smiling at me and asked me, ""Are you looking for this?"" He had the ring with him and you can't imaging how relieved I was. Till this day I had not told this event to anybody else. The event still give me goosebumps. I wish it never happened.",3MD9PLUKKJ0F5PT28DEFI2YP7P2ZN4,
