He was sick and not doing to well. I usually don't get along with him very well and he usually tells me about how I make the wrong decisions in life. I tend to tune him out and not pay attention. When I went to go see him I felt different. He did not seem like the same person. It seemed like he was interested in talking to me and seeing how I was doing. He talked to me about our family history and I listened intently. I was very happy to hear him talk about his past. I felt more connected to him and felt like he wasn't trying to tell me what to do. I was pleased to be able to have a relationship with my dad that was less confrontational and more open. After we were done talking we sat at the table and had dinner and I had a good time. My mom was there and I could tell she was happy that we were getting along. When I finally had to go I thanked them and hugged my dad. I felt like we really turned a leaf on how we got along and from then on things would be different.,3MD9PLUKKJ0F5PT28DEFI2YPD56NZY,
