I woke up to him paralyzed one morning. So, took him to the vet, as one does, and she told me to ""put him down. he won't have a good life. He'll never get better. etc"" since I could not afford the over 10k for back surgery. Went home, cried about it, thought about it, looked up paralyzed dog forums all night long. It was a pretty bad night. Not only that, but the paralysis was very sudden. The night before, he was limping just a little bit. I thought that he'd stepped on something outside during our walk. The day of the incident, other than not being able to move his back legs, he was happy and fine. So, I went back and told her that no, I was going to try. Somehow got him on steroids, did crate-rest with him and did laser treatments. Though, I was told by her that ""This won't make a difference. He'll get urine scald. He'll just suffer."" My vet really knows how to depress the hell out of me, I might say. So, I purchased bed wetting pads and barrier spray for his belly online. He was happy to be home and I was just worried about the future. I did not know if what I was doing was going to make a difference. I was also worried about the money, since, maybe I should have just used it to kill him and have him cremated? I cried a LOT and barely ate for a week. And? He got better.",32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3NZUKE4,
