Jessica and I have been dating for over six years now, with today being the seven year anniversary of the first time we met. She didn't know what was coming when I invited her to meet me after work at a restaurant a few blocks away from the park we met at. I made it seem like it was just going to be a fancy dinner. But, when she got there I acted like the place was full and we had to go somewhere else to eat. Jessica even got a little annoyed with me for not making a reservation. But I led her over to our park, the bench where we had met and my friend had the picnic basket there, just like I prepared. We sat on the bench and ate and drank champagne, watching the sun set. Finally, I got down on one knee and reminded Jessica that this was the same spot we'd met 7 years before. I asked her to marry me and my heart stopped when there was a second of silence. But then she yelled yes! It was so amazing and the best part is she wasn't expecting it. Then, to top it all off, I took her to my apartment where all our family and friends were waiting to celebrate with us. Jessica told everyone all night long how happy she was and how even though we'd talked about marriage, she didn't think I'd propose soon. Or remember the park bench. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for us.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQAD31HUGT
