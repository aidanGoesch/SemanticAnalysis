We live have been living together for three years now and have been very happy together.  Last year we went to five different weddings of mutual friends.  I had never really even entertained the idea of getting married myself until last year.  Well around christmas last year I found myself ring shopping despite my previous notions.  It was overwhelming at first and daunting, trying to find the perfect ring.  I waited for three months with that ring in my desk, it was very difficult to not just give it to her just randomly.  March 9th was a Saturday and I planned just a typical date night as I didn't want to give any hints to what I was going to do. After dinner we just came home and played some cards and enjoyed a bottle of wine.  I spent the rest of the evening laying it on thick about our relationship and what it meant.  I it all seemed to go right over her head and she didn't pick up on what I was getting at.  Incredibly as we were talking about us she made the comment, ""well actions speak louder than words"".  I seized that opportunity and proposed.  The whirlwind that has followed has been intimidating yet fun at the same time as we, but mostly her have been planing the wedding. The reaction from her family was and has been great as the really seem to like me.  They all thought it would never happen as we had been together for so long. The nerves and trepidation I had about being married are now gone and I wish I had done it sooner.  It has kind of changed the way that I look at life in a more positive way.  Things are have a different order of importance and relevance compared to even just last year.  I look forward to my new roles in life and being able to share the world that her and I have created for each other.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQAD31HUGT
