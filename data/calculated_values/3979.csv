I still remember holding her in my arms and rocking her to sleep at night.  I remember singing lullabies to her.  Now, she has grown into a beautiful woman and has found the love of her life.  About a month ago she invited me to go wedding dress shopping with her and her best friend  I was excited to share this special moment with her.  I didn't know if I would still be around when this day arrived, considering all of my health challenges.  I felt very blessed to be there on that day with my daughter.  We walked into the wedding dress shop with smiles on our faces, happy and eager for the entire experience.  I thought back to the day I picked out my wedding dress as I watched my daughter examine the dresses on the racks.  Within ten minutes of looking, she grabbed three dresses she wanted to try on.  They were all very traditional type dresses with puffy skirts, like the kind of dresses you might see on a disney princess.  She went to the dressing room and slipped on the first dress and came out for us to see.  She was glowing with happiness.  She looked like a princess.  The dress fit her just right.  The beadwork was beautiful.  The store attendant brought her a crystal tierra to try on.  My daughter's eyes filled with love for that tierra.  She slipped it on her head and gazed at herself in the mirror.  She was smiling the largest smile ever.  I  soaked in this moment and formed a memory.  I wanted to remember this day forever.  My daughter said, ""This is the dress!"" without even trying on the other two!  We all stared at her and agreed that she looked absolutely gorgeous.  A tear slipped down my cheek as I didn't think I would still be healthy enough to join my daughter in this wonderful adventure of hers.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00GU5
