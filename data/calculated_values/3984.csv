It was an awesome experience to watch him learn how to move on his own. To be able to put him down and let him do his own thing was a welcome experience after several months of carrying him everywhere. I love to watch him explore his world and interact with things. He is growing so fast and I am so proud of every little accomplishment he achieves. I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog. We have had to move a lot of things to higher places that he cannot reach. I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press. I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in. I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time. It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills. I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk. That experience will present its own challenges and I look forward to facing those with him. Every time his independence increases and his reliance on me decreases I feel like my experience as a parent gets better. I love being with him and his personality shines as his abilities increase. I can't wait to see the person that he becomes.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00UGJ,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00UGJ
