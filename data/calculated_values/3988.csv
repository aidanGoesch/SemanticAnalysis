I wanted to do something special, obviously, but it is hard to do that with kids in tow.  I reached out to my mother-in-law for help, and she kindly agreed to take our kids for the weekend.  I also double-checked the work schedules for everyone and it seemed like my thoughts could come together for once!  I decided to grab a reservation for a weekend getaway.  We went to the White Mountains for two nights of fun and reflection at a quaint little hotel I saw online.  I was beautiful and right by a small lake, and not too far from home.  I'm not always a reflective guy, but after ten years of marriage it felt good to spend time just relaxing and talking with my wife.  I really love her and the experiences that we have had together.  Sometimes with kids I forget this.  I don't really know how I got along without her before our marriage.  We sat under the stars one night with our glasses of wine and just talked about how blessed we have been and hopefully will continue to be.  She listened to me talk about my stresses and dreams.  I did the same for her, and then we just laughed about how lucky we are.  I hope that I am writing another journal entry like this in ten years.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC2FGUO
