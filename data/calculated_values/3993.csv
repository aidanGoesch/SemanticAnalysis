It's a very well respected company and I know several people who have moved from my current company to the new one and loved it.  I've been hoping to get on there for a long time. I was feeling optimistic when I applied because this job is basically what I'm currently doing at my job so how could I not get it?! Little did I know when I applied how involved the application process would be. They don't do things like any other company I've interviewed with before. The first round of the interview is all video/audio and not in person at all. I had to answer questions while being recorded, because interviews aren't awkward enough. Most of the questions allowed multiple retakes but a few had limited retakes. The pressure was awful - if I messed up I was out of luck. After I finished the video ""interview,"" my confidence was shaken so I was very surprised to be called for another interview several weeks later. Still, this wasn't in person - it was via phone with the hiring manager. I was told the next step would be in person with the team but instead was asked to supply work samples. My confidence was back after the work samples as I was very proud of what I'd done. I kept anxiously checking my phone for a call on the next steps and was surprised when I got a call offering me the job! I figured there would be more rounds of interviews but I'm so glad there's not!",,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTJA7MVP
