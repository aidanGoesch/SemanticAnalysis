It was a real scare for me and my family. At the time that it happened I didn't know how to react or feel about what was going on. I just couldn't get a grasp of it. being that my mom was badly sickend and she didn't have much time to live. we had asked the doctors if there was anything extra they could do. we wanted to pay top dollar for anything that could maybe save or even prolong her life. Unfortanetly there wasn't anything they could further do to try and help her. It was devastating to hear that. we just couldn't get over all the times we've spent together. everyone was very sad at the hospital. It was bad some of was going through it emotionally and physcially that made things even scarier. It made me think to my self about being strong and doing that benefits my life and body. I decided to be on the healthy side of things for the rest of my life. That situation really made me decide to change my life.,,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTLRIMV0
