My sister was diagnosed with stage 2 melanoma and my dad was being tested for colon cancer. I am so very blessed to say that my sister beat cancer and my dad's tests came back negative. This made me decided to change my life and to not take life so carelessly and for granted. Life is short and you never know when your last day will be. Since then I have lost over 50lbs, I have completely changed how I eat, and I am also beating a health problem that I was diagnosed with. I was told I was on the verge of getting rheumatoid arthritis and would need a cane to walk with, I would have to be on medication my entire life, and that's just how my life would be. I was getting ready to accept it. I did not. I turned my life around. I am healthy, happy, and LUCKY. Lucky to have been able to receive such a message and still have the opportunity to turn my life around before it was too late. My sister lives across the country and we haven't seen each other in almost a decade. This ""health scare"" also made us decide it is finally time that we somehow figure out a way to see each other. So we are counting down the days, 17 more days in fact, until we all reunite on a week long vacation at Disney World.",3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTLRIMV0,
