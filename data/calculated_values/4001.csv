No one ""lied"" to me, but the American Dream, at least for myself, was filled with untruths. The idea, of course, if that if you go to college, get married, have kids, buy a house...etc, that you will experience a life full of joy. A short time ago though I realized that this was not the life for me. Of course I realized this too late. I already have a wife, kids, house and lots of college debt. I now spend my days working to pay interest to the same people who probably made up the story on how to be happy. So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend. We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy. Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it. Find another job. Move. However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy. Well, at least not if you have a conscious. There is a scene in the movie ""Office Space"" that really strikes home. In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life. I feel him. My memorable event was not something that happened ""to me,"" but an awakening inside me. I now find myself thinking about this each day, planning how I might change things, trying to find the courage to become the person I want to be, to live the life I have always wanted. Too bad I have been living the life others told me would make me happy.",3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMTNVMJ,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMTNVMJ
