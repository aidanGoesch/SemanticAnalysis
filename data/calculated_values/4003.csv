I can't believe that much time has gone by.  It seems like it just happened yesterday.  I miss her so much.  Some mornings, I wake up ready to start the day and some mornings I just want to lay in bed and cry.  I try to go my day as if life is good but truthfully, Its so hard to get through the days.  People tell you that she's in a better place and she's not in pain anymore but that doesn't make me feel better.  I don't want my Mom to be in pain but I want her here with me.  I know that's selfish but it's true.  If I could turn back the time, I would not go on that trip.  I know decides when we leave this earth but maybe she will still be here.  I don't know for sure.  I wish she could talk to me and let me know that she is okay.  I go to the cemetery to talk to her and sometimes it helps and sometimes I miss her more.  I try not to let my family know this hurts so bad so they won't be affected but this can get easier to me.",,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMVVMVM
