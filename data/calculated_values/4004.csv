I decided it would be a good idea to grab something to eat. As I walked into the kitchen I saw a huge platter of food on the table, I couldn't resist. I loaded up my plate, way too much food, however, it looked delicious, and I was starving. As I get closer and closer to finishing my plate, I realize I have a lot of food left. Not wanting to embarrass anyone, I attempted to eat all of the food. I ate, and ate until I couldn't anymore. Before I realized it, I was about to throw up, I sped to the bathroom, everyone knew what was going on.  Ruining my Christmas, I heard my family laughing at me as I ran to the bathroom. After leaving the bathroom, I went straight to my room to be by myself.  I was embarrassed, even though everyone else thought it was funny, I thought it was extremely embarrassing. It changed how confident I was at family events. I wanted to be very cautious from here on out, to ensure nothing like this happened again. With 10+ family members over at our house, I decided it'd stay in my room for the rest of the day. I didn't want to embarrass myself.",,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTVN5VMY
