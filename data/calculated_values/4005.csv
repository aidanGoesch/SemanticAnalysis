I was was at home visiting my smug grandma. My entire conceited family and snobbish sister was there with her arrogant baby. I said I cant eat this much ever again. I puked and had to leave the party because I was so sick. I spent all night on the toilet puking out the massive amount of sugar I consumed. This event hurt my confidence a lot. I had trouble sleeping for weeks after. At work and around other people I lost a lot of confidence in myself and began to withdraw into my own mind. Eventually I learned to move on. Use it as a learning experience. And try to gain my confidence in my self in other ways. I tried to take up other hobbies. Because when I become good at something my confidence rises. And I am able to interact with others more.,,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTVN5VMY
