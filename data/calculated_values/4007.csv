She actively volunteered at the local senior center twice per week and  went on her own to her hairdresser every week. In early July she unexpectedly fell hitting her head on concrete. While we waited for an ambulance she never lost consciousness and spoke of getting up. Two neighbors came to assist as torrential rain began to come down. We were all soaked. She spent four days in the hospital where they detected a brain bleed. She seemed on the mend with even the neurologist amazed at what great shape her mind was in at her age. Just six weeks later, during the wee hours of the morning she experienced trouble breathing. We again went to the hospital via ambulance where she remained for ten days. This time the prognosis was far less promising. She was diagnosed with congestive heart failure, acute aortic stenosis and kidney disease. The following weeks saw her decline under home hospice care. She became completely bedridden and unable to consume regular foods. Everything has to pureed to avoid aspiration.",,3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4A48P3MW
