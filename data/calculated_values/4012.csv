She was mad at me because she had asked me to walk to the store to pick up a few things. I agreed to make the walk, but I did not leave the apartment in a hurry. I still had some things I wanted to finish, like eating my sandwich. This greatly annoyed my girlfriend because she thought I was just doing it to be a pain in the butt. We did not argue about this until I had come back from the store. All in all, we probably fussed about the issue for a few minutes before it seemed the issue had been resolved. I was wrong. Later on that night my girlfriend unexpectedly slapped me across the face and told me it was because of my behavior earlier. I was very shocked because this had never happened before. I did not react much because I was so taken off guard. She did not react much either. She just simply told me to continue watching TV and acted like it never happened. Later on that same night she proceeded to hit me three more times. This was for a different reason than the argument we had had earlier. I did not hit her back after any of these attempts. She apologized the next day, but it feels like this memorable and striking moment may have done something to change the dynamic of our relationship for the foreseeable future.",,3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4ATM33MR
