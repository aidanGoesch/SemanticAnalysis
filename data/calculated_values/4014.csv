The timing was unexpected as was our third child. We had been terrified to find out my wife was pregnant at first. It was in August of 2018 when my wife told me. My father had just died and I was dealing with some severe depression -- plus insecurities as a man. It was somewhat ironic that we were pregnant. Our older two had had some health problems with food allergies. In fact, my wife had been bedridden for about a year in 2016 from toxic mold. We were still trying to rebuild our life when we found out she was pregnant with baby number three. Despite having two children, I was absolutely in awe of my third child, a boy like my oldest. He was healthy and happy. In the weeks that followed, he continued to be healthy and he thrived as he grew. Although he is allergic to dairy, he can have a special goat milk formula. Christmas recently passed and it was joyous with all three kids. Our third child is over seven months but already wearing eighteen month clothing. This year was perhaps the best Christmas ever. An unexpected child who is the joy of our life and two older siblings that absolutely adore him. We are also three years removed from my wife's sickness. My older two kids have outgrown most of their food allergies. Life is good and I am thankful to have the opportunity to write about this. This reflection has caused me to realize just how much life can change in a short period of time.",3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXJYEDLG,
