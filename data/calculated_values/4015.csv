Although we have two older children, this birth was significant to us. As a family, we have been through a lot. Our oldest was born with severe food allergies and he would scream for six to seven hours a day. He eventually outgrew much of this but our second child, a daughter, also had some issues with food allergies. Needless to say, my wife and I were a bit stressed over the prospect of a third child. The day of the birth came and my wife began having contractions. Now on our third child, the hospital trip was largely uneventful. We arrived and checked in and waited for her contractions to become more painful. It was around 3:00 am and we were both hoping that the day would be over sooner rather than later. Around 5:00 in the morning, my wife began to get closer and her water broke. From here on out, it was largely a waiting game for us. Our room was situated with a view of the Penobscot River. The sun began to slowly rise and it was the most spectacular view I have ever seen. Rays of sun casts pink and purple hues over the river and accented the landscape around the large town of Bangor, Maine. My wife had a doula on hand who also did photography of the event. The day was very special and stressful at times. After a couple hours of contractions, my wife's contractions intensified. Within the space of thirty minutes, she dilated to the point that she was ready for birth. The process itself was painful with no epidural. I helped encourage her through the birth of our son and prayed for. When our son was born, it was beautiful. Although he screamed as most newborns do, he quickly calmed down. He was able to nurse right away and for once it seemed like we had a happy baby. After having two fussy babies, our third baby was nothing short of a miracle.",3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXJYEDLG,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXJYEDLG
