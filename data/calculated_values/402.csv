It's not often that I completely embarrass myself in front of all my coworkers, but I definitely succeeded in doing that this past holiday season. About 6 weeks ago I went to a backyard cookout hosted by Mike. When I got there, Mike surprised me by asking me to watch his son during the cookout. I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in. After about a half hour of talking to his son, I was starting to get a bit bored and stressed. I decided to sneak a beer from the cooler without telling Mike. When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son. I said to myself, what the heck, and decided to have a few more beers. By the third beer, things were getting a bit out of control. I don't remember doing this exactly, but according to my other co-workers, I took my shirt off and was running around the backyard pretending to be a unicorn by sticking the can of beer to my forehead and pretending it was my horn I guess. While my coworkers were not amused, Mike's son and all the other kids at the cookout were laughing hysterically at my crazy antics. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the burgers that Mike was cooking up the whole time as he unsurprisingly kicked me out. At least I didn't lose my job.",,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAP7C5P6R
