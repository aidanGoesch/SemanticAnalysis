I’ve become much closer with my friends and family since. I now understand that life can be so short and unpredictable. My cousin that passed away left behind 2 kids that i would love to spend more time with. Just waiting to actually visit that town. I have developed a much better relationship with her sisters as well because before she passed, I really didn’t talk to them. Now I actually try and make a concerted effort with speak with that side of the family as often as weekly. It makes me happy tp think how my cousin would feel if she knew that her passing would bring out family closer together. I still don’t really talk to my dad about it. I really should reach out and form a better relationship, but I have no desire to do that. Sometimes I won’t what it would be like to be dead. I always wonder what it would be like to feel nothing. I’ve been talking to my therapist about these thoughts and apparently feeling that way is common upon college students. I really do love and miss my cousin and definitely wish I could have one last conversation. I just wish I had her back for one last conversation.",3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXLFHDLJ,
