As a child my mother was a single mother. There was 4 of us kids in all. My father left when I was 2 years old. My mother was with different men every other day, and didn't care to much for us kids. As I being the oldest I had to step up, and help out for the rest of my siblings. One day I came home from school and noticed my mom was drunk and acting erratically. It was then that my life changed forever. She began to use me to get what she wanted. She would start advertising me to the men she was with for money. Years of this went on until I got old enough to realize it had to stop. I reported my situation to a family friend who took my siblings and I in into her home. It was then I realized I had far more problems mentally than I thought. I started having nightmares, waking up trembling, breaking out in sweats. I couldn't sleep at night, and I knew I needed help. My caretaker at the time took me to a therapist, who recommended me to a ptsd specialist. I was diagnosed with PTSD. I was definitely relieved to know what was gong on, but now it was how can I treat it to live a normal life. The specialist recommended me to look into medical cannabis. I took the recommendation, and obtained my medical cannabis card for ptsd. Then my life improved significantly for beyond what I had hoped.",,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXVDRDLZ
