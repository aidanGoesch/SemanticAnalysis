Since going on it I have been able to get off of all of the other medications I was taking.  My energy and willingness to participate in life has also changed drastically in this time period.  I had spent most of my life since 2012 basically sedentary and having given up hope after the passing of my wife.  I spent years trying to get help through pharmaceuticals and counseling to be left little more than a zombified prisoner in a group home waiting to die.  It has been a change in my life that I never expected to be this drastic.  A lot of me wanting the card was I just wanted to be able to get high and escape.  I knew it might help some, but if I am honest with myself I wanted to get high.  That being said I am now walking 5 miles 4-5 times a week, am actively hunting for a job, my cleanliness and grooming are also hugely improved to daily cleaning and showering(I would straighten the house maybe 3 times a year and was living in squalor and was only bathing a couple times a  month), and there have been other improvements in my overall outlook and quality of life as well these are just some major ones.  There have been a few negatives, mostly just being a bit more forgetful, but nothing compared to the side effects that left me sleeping most of the day and tired the rest.  I have energy and I have hope that I can find some sort of life that I can at least be content with in the near future all of which I would have laughed at you and probably been very hostile if I was told this was possible before.  So I have to add sentences because whoever coded this messed up.  It says it must be 15-25 sentences or 600-3000 characters.  I was over 1600 characters at 8 sentences when my story was finished so it should have been fine.  But it seems the coder made this an and statement instead of an or statement or something like that.",,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXVDRDLZ
