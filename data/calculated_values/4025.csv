It was a big step in both our lives. A room became available at a friend's place, so he decided to take it. It was quite sad for me to help him find his belongings that he wanted to take. That said we had a lot of fun finding old toys and books in his room that he had forgotten about. We talked a lot during that time. Remembering fun times. I was very sad when he left, but he told me he would be back soon. I missed him from the very moment he was gone.  He came back very soon. The washing machine at the new house wasn't working!  He has returned quite a lot since then. Always with his laundry! I miss him a lot but I am glad that he is on a new adventure in his life. Everyone is happy.",3MTMREQS4W44RBU8OMP3XSK7PPIWAQ,
