I can't believe this day turned out to be the way it did. Saw the horror of a life departing from this world. Me and john were riding along the freeway. We were travelling to Detroit, a getaway that was planned months ago. The day progressed as usual. We stopped across a departmental store to get some snacks for the trip. To our horror, a car rode past us so fast that we knew something way wrong straight away. The driver had a seizure, we were told later. The car ran into a fast food truck as we were watching. I can still hear that noise when i close my eyes. The car hit the truck real bad. When we got there, we saw the horror. The fast food vendor was lying there, in a giant pool of blood. he was gone. His wife crying uncontrollably, holding her man, broke my heart.",,3MX2NQ3YCAGMA5NH3VU8R0ISEKA5XV
