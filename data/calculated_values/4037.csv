I was divorce for 16 years and not knowing i will found another girl who will complete me and love me as much as i love her. I meet this girl online and she was living far from me ( other country) , i love her smile, her generosity and kindness. I knew i love her before i meet her and when we first meet yes it is true, i fall in love more than i think of. We did everything to be together (her moving in USA) and now we are happily living together and officially married. It was 2015 when we talk online and i visited her after a month of talking. 2016 i came back to her country to see her again and getting to know each other more. 2017 when i came back again and we travel together everywhere. i know she is the one for me and i know she loves me so much too. That visit was so memorable when i propose to her and she said yes. After the proposal i came back to USA and i petitioned her so we can be together for good. We been through a lot but we never give up. We know that giving up is not an option. 2019 she got her visa and she flew to USA and still cant believe we are together already. The long wait is over, now i can hold her, kiss her and tell her how much i love her everyday. 5 months ago we got married and its one of my happiest and memorable moment in my life.",3MX2NQ3YCAGMA5NH3VU8R0ISG995XA,3MX2NQ3YCAGMA5NH3VU8R0ISG995XA
