It was such a beautiful day, and I was & still am so happy that she found her person. But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her. Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable. Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy. I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out. As if standing up in front of all those people wasn't enough pressure. Now, I thought, I'd have to either do it with a giant wet stain down my front, or change and be the only person in the wedding party wearing old, ripped jeans. I even thought, for a moment, about just sitting the whole thing out. But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman. Luckily, our wonderful grandma made it to the wedding that day. Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out. It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest. I know it's probably not as big of a deal as I make it out to be, but I've always been prone to anxiety. My cousin is so important to me and I just couldn't stand the thought of ruining her big day. She's waited so long for it. Thankfully, it all went according to plan and she's got perfect, champagne-stain-free photos to look back on and remember forever. I'm so happy it all worked out in the end.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJ2N44GN
