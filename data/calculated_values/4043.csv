We saw lots of animals and nature. It was so beautiful. There were lots of places to stop and take pictures. I think my husband started getting a little bored though. He started trying to entertain himself. My husband thought it would be funny to pretend to be Sasquatch and give me a scare! I however, did not think that was funny. We stopped hiking for awhile and had a picnic lunch. My husband brought all my favorite food which was really sweet. It made me forgive him for trying to scare me earlier. When we finished lunch, we packed up our things. Our our way back to the car we hear a noise behind us. I turned around, and started telling my husband not to try and scare me again. But it wasn't him. It was a bear. We stayed as still as possible and luckily to bear moved on to more interesting things. That was our anniversary adventure.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJAUD4GI
