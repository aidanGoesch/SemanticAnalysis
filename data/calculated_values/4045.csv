At the top of the steps I felt my feet give out on me.  I fell down the steps and hit my head. My parents tried to help me up after the fall but I felt lightheaded and could not stand up. My parents had to call 911. The ambulance came and took me to the hospital. The doctor did a lot of test on me and thank goodness nothing was broken and I was fine except for a lot of lightheartedness. The doctors wanted to keep me overnight for observation to ensure I was fine. That night I was sore and could not sleep from everyone checking in on me. My mother stayed with me to keep my company and to make sure that I did not need anything. After being released I spent two weeks recovering. My mother took the time off of work to be with me and assist me with anything that I may need. I spent those two weeks down stairs recovering and after that time it was so nice to be able to walk up the steps and sleep in my own bed. I am going to more careful after this happened. This was the first time I ever had to spend time in the hospital.,,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJBYIG48
