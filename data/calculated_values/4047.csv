I landed on my head and ended up being basically knocked out cold. Luckily both my parents were home at the time and called 911. The ambulance came out picked me up to take me to the hospital, although I was told I had kind of regained consciousness before they arrived. I work up in the hospital to my whole family being there, at least that is what they told me as my memory of the day is hazy, which was nice. It was the since I was liked 4 years old that I had ever been in a hospital. I basically just sat on a bed while they ran tests on me. Luckily nothing was bad at all, I had no broken bones or trauma or anything. I did have to stay overnight in the hospital just so they could evaluate me to me fully sure I was fine since I was still very lightheaded. My family left to go home, although my mother did stay overnight at the hospital with me since she insisted. I got discharged in the morning and came home. I then spend the next two weeks recovering as I had to let my head recover. My memory was also not very good during that time but everything is back to normal now. My brother took a picture of me when I was out of it on the hospital bed. It is funny to look back at now, although I still basically have a fuzzy memory regarding the events of the day. This was the first time in my life I have had to deal with a serious injury, as before this the worst thing to happened to me was just stuff like stubbing my toe. It was also my first time having to deal with hospital bills in the aftermath, that was a lot of fun. Luckily, I had insurance so it was not as bad as it could have been.",3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJBYIG48,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJBYIG48
