Going on adventures is something that I have always loved to do. So I planned a trip to go to South Dakota to visit various landmarks. I didn't want to travel alone, so I decided to take a childhood friend along for the trip. She is really good at finding different places to go explore and see. On our way to South Dakota we started planing what places to visit first, as we travel through. I have always had a passion for history so I definitely wanted to explore all the historic sites I could. It turns out people there still celebrate celebrities there that have been dead for 200 years. I thought that was awesome. It means alot for people to celebrate lives that has made a impact in our society.  As we visited these historic places we would see pictures of some celebrities and their background history. We also came across different sites where you can actually see their accomplishments It was an amazing experience to witness. To know that these people will never be forgotten brings a smile to face. It was an adventure worth taking. I have many memories that I hold to remember this trip. I am glad that I took the time out of my job and got to take the trip with my friend. It twill be an experience I will never forget.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJDNJG4P
