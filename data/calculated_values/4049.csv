I visited a burial ground with the graves of Wild Bill Hickock, Calamity Jane, and Seth Bullock.  There were flowers there that present-day people left there to commemorate these legends.  I took a tour down downtown South Dakota, and watched a reenactment of when Wild Bill was shot in a saloon.  Then, I got to visit that saloon.  The whole city of Deadwood has a nostalgic feel like you are transported right back to the time those characters in history existed.     Also there are many shops to visit.  Some people talk to you in an old-time manner, and you feel like you are talking to an old shop keeper of the time period.  The hotels in the area are designed like casino themes much like the time period that they were probably casinos.  There is a lot of memorabilia to buy.   An actor in the play we saw had given us a free deputy badge to cherish. it took a long time for us to travel there by car.  We drove about 15 hours to get there.  It was well worth the wait though. It was unlike anything I have ever done before, and I would recommend anyone do it who is a history buff from that time period.",3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJDNJG4P,
