My father needed to revisit the same hospital for a post-operation check-up.  He could have driven there himself this time, but he doesn't do well in big city traffic environment.  My mom insisted on joining, and she couldn't drive either, because she has a horrible sense of direction and gets easily lost.  So, once again, it was up to me to make the lengthy drive.  I knew the potential for the three of us to trigger various stresses in one another.  It's only worse when all three of us are together.  With just two, there's a bit lesser chance for a blow-up. The drive would be different this time, which posed a potential challenge.  There was construction happening that forced us to take an alternate route.  So, even though this was only a check-up appointment, and not an actual series of tests or an operation, the detour added a dimension of unpredictability. While I was bothered by having to go through this experience a sixth or seventh time, I knew it was important.  Letting either of my parents make the drive themselves would have been selfish on my part, and made things worse for them.  From what I remember, this was one of the smoothest of the hospital trips so far.  And we had a decent time eating and shopping afterwards.",32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAP7MRP6X,
