I had heard about these only in T.V. shows and was interested to see them for myself.   Most of the landmarks were people-related.   They were related to  figures in the ""Old West"" who were famous and had been written about in U.S. history books.  The most memorable thing that I learned on this trip is after 200 years of being gone,  these people were still being remembered.  I visited Wild Bill Hickok's grave, and people of various walks of life had left fresh mementos on his grave like he died yesterday.   I watched play about how he was shot that occurred in the middle of the street.  Traffic was shut down for the play.   They used a gun shooting blanks to give this event weight, and I got goosebumps from that.  Then I visited the bar where he was actually killed.  The bar is marked as a historical landmark.   This is the first historical landmark I have ever visited.  They have updated the bar, of course, and put slot machines in it for modern-day visitors.   It had an old-time feel though, like they still left a couple original pieces in it from the 1800's.",3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJDNJG4P,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJDNJG4P
