My cousin and grandfather have the same birthday. Myself and my two brothers are all born in the same month. This always makes celebrating easy, but a big event. This year we decided to go to an amusement park. I've been there before, but most of my family hadn't been there in years. Even so, I knew we would all have a great time. As it turned out, some of us had a little bit too much of a good time! My cousin has always been kind of a problem drinker and we all hoped he would control himself this time. This was not the case. The day started out great. A lot of catching up and laughs. It was around lunch time and we all decided to get something to eat. A few others had a drink, nothing unusual, but my cousin went overboard. For the rest of the day he was very loud and even got kicked off one of the rides. We still had a lot of fun and made some great memories.",,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MPJVD45
