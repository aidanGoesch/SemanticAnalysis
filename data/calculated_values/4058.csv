My younger brother's birthday was also a couple days prior in May. Family from Hawaii decided to come visit us so that we could all celebrate each other's birthday's together. They visited for a whole week. We had a lot of fun. We ate a lot of good food. We went shopping together. We even decided to go to Knott's Berry Farm together. It was a special trip for the birthday celebrators. We left the house early. It was warm but not too hot that day. There were a lot of people at the amusement park because it was currently summer. I didn't kind though because it is normal. We rode a lot of fun rides together. We even ate the signature food of the amusement park, funnel cake. We had a lot of fun. We made a lot of good memories. The most memorable moment was about this trip was the water ride. This ride also happens to be my absolute favorite. There was no wait time and that just made it even more better. I went on the ride with my younger sister. I had a lot of fun. I screamed a lot but I enjoyed it. My clothes got wet but it was refreshing in the warm weather. It was a great day.",3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MPJVD45,
