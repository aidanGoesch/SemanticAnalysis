It was devastating to me because I spent the majority of my childhood with her. My parents had to work about 12 to 14 hours everyday. They worked at a restaurant so they were always tired after work and went to sleep right away. I did not spend much time with them, so my grandmother too care of me a lot. The funeral was large because she had quite a few children and all of them attended. My grandmother had a lot of friends too so it was nice seeing all of them paying their respect. I did not talk much during the funeral. All I could do was think about all the good memories we had together. It was nostalgic. Seeing her body in the casket felt unreal. I could not believe that I could no longer spend time with her anymore. It made me regret not seeing her much when I was an adult. When they lowered the casket down in the grave, I cried a lot because the moment was truly the last time I would see her. I just hoped she was in a better place now.",3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCJD4N,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCJD4N
