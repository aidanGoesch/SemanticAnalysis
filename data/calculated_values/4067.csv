It was the summer that I felt I would know my place in life. I've always felt like I had a good grip on the games education, work, and in my personal life.  Holiday parties are usually boring and mundane but I knew this would be different because of the expanded invitation list.  It was my 5th wedding anniversary and was also a combination party for the 4th of July.  The list included family, neighbors and many of my old friends who happened to be in the area this time of year. I thought it would be great to reconnect with many old acquaintances and friends and catch up with them and reminisce about old times and what's been going on with their lives.  I have been a good been a good pen pal (old school) with many of them so I kind of understand where they are at in their life.  Now I get to see the fruits of their labors -  their wives and their children have come here in full knowledge of having a great time.  They came and they arrived in droves and caravans.  The pavilion tent was set up and the catering was in place.  The chairs and tables were set up picnic style and everyone took their place.  This was by far the biggest party I've ever thrown.  Conversations were amazing, the details were vivid and the stories of the past just kept rolling off like a waterfall.  It was at this time I realized that the things that I thought were important Lake success at work and amount of money that I had in the bank were just a part of my life, they shouldn't have been the focus like I always made them.  Seeing the families and how close they were made realize how lucky I really was as a dad and hey, I had the extra time and effort to do the same.  I'd always been self-serving and self-centered but I was just playing the part of the leader of the family. I guess I really didn't understand what that meant to all the others around me until one of my best friends told me that his daughter was suffering from an advanced form of cancer. He spent every waking moment with her hand put everything else on his life on hold.  It was at that time I realized that if that ever happened to me, I'm not mentally equipped and I would have to find that type of determination in my soul which I currently don't have.  It was at that time I felt that I was no longer just the most important person in the world.  Being a father is much more than just being a someone who supports the family with material needs.   I would have to fundamentally change everything about me. I knew there was a reason I was looking forward to this day. The good news is his daughter is going to pull through and live a healthy life but it is changing me in ways that I couldn't have imagined.",,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5K32RMH0
