He had a big barbecue and a lot of people brought fireworks for afterwards. I ended up running into some old friends who I hadn't seen in close to 10 years. They attended a family reunion the day before and decided to stay over another day to visit with old friends in the area. We had a lot of fun (and a lot of drinks) while we were catching up. I've always thought one of them should've been a comedian. He is always making people laugh, and that night was no exception. The more intoxicated he became the funnier (and more offensive) he got. We celebrated and watched fireworks well into the night. If I remember right, it was somewhere around 3 AM by the time I left. That was the first time I had let loose and had a lot of fun in a long, long time. It was a good reminder of what my teenage years felt like. After sobering up and taking some time to think about it I realized that I needed to make some changes to my lifestyle. All I had really been doing was working, either at my job or in the gym. The lifestyle of a natural bodybuilder demands a ton of discipline and a huge time investment. I became so committed to these goals over the years that I basically stopped trying to have fun. I just didn't feel like I had time for it. After that night I decided that needed to change, and my life has become more enjoyable since.",3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5K32RMH0,
