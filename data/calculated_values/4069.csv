Everyone came over for a big barbecue and to watch a fireworks display after. When I arrived I couldn't believe that a couple of my old high school friends were there. I hadn't seen these guys in nearly a decade. It turns out they were in town for a family reunion and decided to stop over and celebrate with us. It was great to catch up with them. We had a lot of laughs. One of them was always the class clown and he got pretty drunk, hilarity ensued. People were shaking their heads, others were rolling on the ground laughing. I won't repeat any of it here because it could be pretty offensive. We watched fireworks well into the night and I ended up getting drunk for the first time in about 15 years. I felt like a high school kid again (at least until I sobered up later). It was just a really positive, almost magical night. One of those times where everything seems to come together and just make sense. When I looked back on it, I realized that I haven't been living my life the way I'd like. I have just been going through the motions. Since then I've made it a point to try to enjoy life more.",3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5K32RMH0,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5K32RMH0
