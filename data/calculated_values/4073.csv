We quickly got ourselves ready at home and hurriedly packed ourselves into our small commuter sedan to start our day. On the way to the mall I asked my daughter, ""what is it like being 7? I'm sure it beats being 6 still!"". Blushing, she responded,"" I'm one step closer to being as old as you mommy! I wanna be just like you one day"". Her response melted my heart, I knew she always looked up to me for guidance and strength during times she wasn't feeling strong spirited, but it was even more meaningful to actually hear her say it out loud. As a single mother of 5 years, I always wanted to be strong for my little girl, and after her dad walked out on us, I knew she needed a strong role model in her life. Therefore, I made it my life's goal to do just that. Once we stopped at the mall in the next town over I started feeling this chest pain again that I experienced for the past two days. It wasn't something I was overly concerned about at the time, but it certainly did cause me enough pain to end the conversation I was having with my daughter. I didn't want to show her that I was in pain because mom's aren't supposed to get sick. Continuing to ignore the pain, we entered the mall ready to have a great day together when all of a sudden, the intensity of the pain grew even more. The pain was so bad that i dropped to my knees to the floor and yelled for someone to call an ambulance. it felt like my ribcage was about to cave in on itself. In a daze, I woke up in the ER in what seemed to be in a split second of travel. I was relieved to see my daughter standing beside me holding my hand because for her to witness the scariest moment of my life, I did not want to to feel afraid.",,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KDCYHMW
