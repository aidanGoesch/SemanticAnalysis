One day they became so strong, I knew I'd had better go to the ER. Moms arent suppose to get sick I kept telling myself. The doctor came in and ordered a bunch of tests. I had EKC's, chest xrays, blood, urine..you name it I had it..Now waitng for the results, I wasnt ready to hear the results. The doctor came back in and said not only did I have a slight heart attack, but I have 4 blockages. he explained that I need stents, and I couldnt wait..I said fine. The next day was surgery day. I was scared but knew God was watching over me..I said my prayers, hugged and kissed my family and left. fter what seemed like days, I was in my room, with littlle pain and thankful for God and staff for being their for me. After it was all over, I wanted to see my kids and tell them I loved them. My husband knew I loved him. I just felt the need to remind my kids. They were so happy.. They hugged me so tight. I was blessed to have more years with them. They know we have better days ahead. Make everyday count. We sure did too.",3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KDCYHMW,
