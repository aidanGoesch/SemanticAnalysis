I had a mild heart attack that caused nerve damage on my left side. I knew I had to make some life changes. That's when I knew I had to work less, stress less and pray more. I had always worked hard and alot of overtime. I never realised what I was doing to myself. I thought as long as I stayed active, I was doing my body good. I guess I didn't know my body as well as I once did. Age does make a difference. My body was aging and I wasn't as young as I use to be. After going to the ER and hearing the Doctor tell me I had a mild heart attack, I was in shock. He told me that I may have a major heart attack following or even mini strokes. I felt this may have been God's message to slow me down. I know he was telling me, he was there for me. I needed to pray more and stop trying to take care of everything myself. He was right! I now take things without stress and focus more on my health.",3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KDCYHMW,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KDCYHMW
