My husband rushed me to our local hospital, although I had planned to delivery at a larger hospital in a nearby city. Our local hospital isn't very well-equipped, and there are no gyns on staff, and sometimes, there isn't even a doctor there. But I had no choice, It was close, and I was suffering, so we went. Fortunately, a doctor was available, though she wasn't an ob-gyn. The baby was coming so fast, there was no time for an epidural, so I couldn't have any pain meds. Also fortunately, my baby, Charles, was healthy and continues to do well a week later. I wish I could say the same for myself. The pain usually goes away after delivery, but that didn't happen. I had and still have very bad low back pain. Sometimes it is excruciating, so bad, in fact, that I find it difficult to stand. My husband's mother is staying with us to help take care of Charles, and she is a godsend. I don't know what I would do without help right now. I have an appointment to see an orthopedic specialist but not till next week. Until then, we are just taking it a day at a time. This should be such a special time to enjoy my new baby, but it's not. We are all just getting by, day to day with the help of my mother in law. I haven't heard of anyone else having exactly this experience, and I really can't believe they even sent me home from the hospital. Honestly, I have to wonder if I would still be in this much pain if I had been able to give birth at the larger hospital.",,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KN9TMH0
