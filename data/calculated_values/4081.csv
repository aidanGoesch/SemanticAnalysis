I had the absolute worst day I have ever had in my life!!! So I went to the landlord to tell him that my pipes in my bathroom were leaking and he needed to get a plumber here to take a look at them. No big deal right, I thought I would just fill out a form and my name would be on a waiting list. I was so wrong about that! As soon as I walked in I could already tell that he was in a bad bad mood. He gave me an evil eye as soon as he saw me, he spoke to me rudely and asked what I wanted and why was I bothering him. First of all, I am not bothering anyone, this is his job and that is what he needs to do. I was polite though, I am not going to be rude about it, anyway. I told him that my pipes were leaking and I needed someone to come look at it. He asked me if I had looked at it myself because if I could do it myself then I should be here asking him. I was taken a little aback and I told him that it was his job to do this and I expected it to be done soon. That was the wrong thing to say to him, because he jumped up out of his chair, yelled at me called me an idiot and stupid and that he should rip uo my contract to the apartment because he was tired of me being needy. I was completely floored by this and just ran out of there. I was so completely mad that I almost wanted to call my lawyer and sue him or something. I went to the local coffee house, and called my friend who talked me down a little. Once I felt better about the situation I decided to go back home and try to ignore my landlord. Well, he was there waiting for me in the entry way with a completely different look on his face. He apologized profusly and told me that he had just found out some bad news and said that he hopes I forgive him, and that he will have the plumber up there in the morning. I forgave him because I can understand someone having a bad day, I went upstairs and went to bed.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26BCFUK2
