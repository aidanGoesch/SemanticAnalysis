There were problems in the water system of the building before. I took care of this problem myself because it was simple. then the electrical system began to fail and I don't understand the electricity business, so I gave the building owner notice, but he passed away. but the big problem broke out 3 months ago. In heavy rain, the roof of the house was very bad and the upper floor of the building became unusable. this was purely a structural problem of the house and as a tenant I had no fault of use. the situation again I gave notice to the landlord. at first he wanted to pass. but when I insisted he came and saw the problem in place. I had a really serious damage and, according to the contract, he had to pay compensation to me and get the roof repaired. he would have to pay a substantial amount for these expenses. he told me that, despite the contract between us, he would not pay anything, that if I wanted to sit, I had to accept the building like this, that the rent rate would increase very much due to the shopping mall to be opened soon, and that I was so stupid that I could almost know that I was sitting for free. the landlords in this neighborhood kept saying how positive the new shopping mall would be. but things did not go as expected by the landlords. The company that made the shopping center went bankrupt due to a serious loan debt. The shopping center construction unfinished passed to the lending bank. The bank did not want to continue to the shopping center construction. due to this event, the rental rates in the neighborhood decreased to lower amounts than before. What did my landlord do? albeit forced to repair the roof, he paid me compensation for my belongings. There was only one requirement to extend the duration of the contract for another 5 years. because he knew perfectly well that when I evacuated this house, maybe 1 or 3 years, he can't rent this place to anyone. How do I know? no one has been sitting in the building next to me for exactly 3 years, but the owner of that building has to pay dues for the site costs.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26BCFUK2
