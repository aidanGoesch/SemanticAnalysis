He was being a jerk and other stuff was going on with him emotionally, I think. Anyway, I was walking with my friend close by to my building. This guy and the owner have known each other for like 25 years! They had been fighting lately. I guess they were kind of antagonizing each other. They're 2 old men in a really, really small town, you see. Anyway, they were in a fight, and when the owner saw me with me friend, he started yelling. He yelled that my friend was NOT allowed in my house (his property but I pay rent). He would NEVER set foot in there again. I was upset and told the owner that we needed to talk about this. I wanted him to explain to me what was going on, since I had no idea about their fight at the time. He shouted that no, he would not explain, and that if I hung out with my friend I am an idiot! He called me an idiot. Then he stalked off. I was so mad I didn't accept his (half-hearted) apology the next day, and then we were in a fight. I told him he can't just decide who is allowed at my house. He said he would rip up the contract and he didn't care. I thought about leaving, but after about 3 days we were able to talk civilly (my husband facilitated a lot of that because I was still angry) and we decided to stay. I'm glad we did! We were able to end things at that place on good terms, and move into a better situation. We are still cordial/friends with the owner.",3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26BCFUK2,
