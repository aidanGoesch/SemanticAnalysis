In the end, it was the most wonderful and exciting thing that ever happened in my life.  This story,is my story, of the birth of Robin Marie Johnson. It was our first baby, we were nervous, excited, and afraid.  We read all the books, we went to all the classes, she took the right vitamins, and ate healthy.  But nothing could have prepared us for that 48 hours at Mercer hospital.  I thank all the doctors and nurses and most of all I thank Emily my wife, I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful woman a part of my life. We had been to the hospital a couple of times already with false labor pains, so when she told me it was happening 3 weeks ago, I was excited but skeptical.  We loaded up the mini-van and drove the 23 miles to Mercer.  She was brought to a room and they did some testing and we waited and waited and waited.  I finally went and found a nurse, we had sat in the room for 4 hours and no one would tell us what was going on.  She explained that there were three woman in active labor right now and that my wife was just in the beginning stages of labor.  A doctor would come talk to us when they had time.  That was 8 hours later.  We had nurses constantly check on my wife but we weren't able to talk to a doctor till nearly 12 hours after we were checked in.  It turns out it was a full moon, crazy night and in total 42 babies were born in 48 hours.  The hospital averaged 6 births a day.  The doctor told us he would have normally induced, but he just didn't have the time so we went through a long slow process.  Robin has 41 friends that share her birthday, she has all her fingers and toes, and definitely has two parents that love her.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26GY4UK4
