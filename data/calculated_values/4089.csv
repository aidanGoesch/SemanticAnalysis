I waited too long.  My poor dog had an awful last night.  I stayed up with her and pet her and comforted her as best as I could but she was in pain.  My incredibly stoic strong girl way whining and in pain.  I told her how much I loved her.  What a good good girl she was.  How much joy she brought to my life.  I asked her to forgive me for waiting.  And I asked her to forgive me for saying goodbye.  After several months I still feel guilty and wonder if I did the right thing, did she understand, did she know I loved her so much, could she feel me petting her sweet face as she went to sleep, did she hear me tell her she was a good, good girl and that I loved her? Could she feel the sunshine on her fur?  Did she know she was on her deck surrounded by trees and birds and squirrels? I hope so.  The plan was that I would spread her ashes in the woods near the lake where we loved to walk and she had so much joy.  But her ashes are still here.  I’m not ready to let her go yet.  There’s some comfort in knowing she’s here, she’s home.  I don’t have her displayed and I don’t constantly talk about her, but boy oh boy do I still talk to her and miss her.  Her name has become some sort of mantra for me, when i get anxious or scared I talk to her and call her.  It’s not healthy, I know.  I also know that within the next year I will likely have another dog, never a replacement for my girl, but a new companion to play and explore with.  I miss my dog.",3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26GYBKU1,
