I got home from visiting my mom and I found her lying on the stairs, lethargic and sad.  I carried her up the stairs to my bedroom, her bedroom, and I got her water to drink. I stayed up with her all night making sure the water went down and that she started to perk up again.  I hand fed her a bit of food at a time.  Over the next few days I thought she had turned the corner and we were even able to go out for short walks.  I was so relieved.  I was hoping that she would rally as she has done every time in the past.  I was wrong.  On Monday we went out for a walk, it was a short one.  I didn't know it would be our last. She loved being outside but that day she started to drag, her head was hanging, i turned towards home.  As we got closer she spotted a bunny, her head came up, tail up, ears at attention and she pulled a bit.  That was my girl, ready to give chase.  But she gave in to me quickly when I calmed her and lead her away.  The next day she was tired, and that night was long and painful for her.  She could barely stand, walking was a struggle.  I stayed up with her that night and knew I was saying goodbye.  I petted her, soothed her, thanked her for being such a great companion.  My stoic girl vocalized her discomfort and pain.  As soon as it was morning I called and arranged for the vet to come to our home.  I wanted my girl to be on her deck in the sunshine when she fell asleep for the last time.  I miss her every day.  And I can still hear her phantom feet in my very empty and quiet home.",3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26GYBKU1,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26GYBKU1
