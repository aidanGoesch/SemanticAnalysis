This is an event that we have attended regularly for the last 5 years. We were joined by a close friend, who came in from out of state. This year was different, because we finally lived close enough to the event that we didn't have to camp the entire weekend; we could go home each night, shower, and sleep in an actual bed. This was great because it gave us a chance to start each day refreshed, as opposed to previous years, when the camping would leave us grimy and sore. I also could get a full night's sleep because we didn't have campers nearby keeping us up with their assorted activities. The acts announced this year were not nearly as exciting as previous years, save for a few big names. However, we were still excited at the prospect of finding new bands to enjoy. In the week leading up to the festival, the weather was mostly rain and storms, which started to worry me; even though we weren't camping, we would still be outdoors all day, and I didn't want to spend the weekend standing in rain and mud. However, the rain let up going into the weekend, and save for a few light showers one or two days, the weather was perfect the whole weekend. The music was great, as always, and it was nice to be able to spend a weekend with my girlfriend and our friends, without having to worry about work or other responsibilities. After everything was over, I was very tired and a little bit unhappy at the prospect of having to go back to work the following day, but overall, I was happy to have had a good weekend out. I don't get to take vacations too often, so small events like this are what I rely on to keep me refreshed and ready to take on the next challenge. I look forward to attending it or a similar event next year. In the meantime, I will look back fondly on the festivals I have attended previously, and will find smaller events to keep me excited until the next big one.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26HSMKU1
