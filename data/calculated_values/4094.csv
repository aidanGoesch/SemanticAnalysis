The morning to be more precise. I was in my room watching TV while my parents were in the living room doing the same. It seemed like a normal calm day like any other day. That mornings calmness was shattered when I heard a loud thump and  shortly after the sound of my step mother screaming  for me. I rushed to the living room to find my dad on the floor and my step mother hysterical in panic.  She said he wouldn't get up or respond. I went over to my dad and saw that he had stopped breathing. Without even thinking I called 911 and tried to do CPR on my dad while the ambulance came. Time seemed to slow down as we waited for the paramedics to arrive. Once they did though it seemed like someone hit the fast forward button. They showed up and asked what all had happened then got to work on my dad. They worked on him for what seemed like a minute but in reality was more like 10 minutes. They decided that they needed to rush him to the hospital to try to do anything more that they could. My step mother went with them while I stayed behind and cleaned up the mess the paramedics had made as well as to call family members and let them know what was going on.  About 2 or 3 hours later I got the news that my father had passed away.  The doctors tried everything they could and they would get his heart started and he would be stable for a minute or two before it would stop. It got to the point where the doctors had said that they could keep on working and try to stabilize him as best as they could but with how much time had passed that even if they could his braid had been without oxygen for so long that he would have been basically brain dead and would have been on machines for the rest of his life. We had to make an impossible choice. As much as we wanted to keep fighting me and my step mother knew what choice my father would have made if he was asked. So we made the hardest decision in our lives and let him go.  That was the worst day of my life.,,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26IGCKU4
