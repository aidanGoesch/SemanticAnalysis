He said he was in town from London, and wanted to get together.  I thought this was odd since I hadn't seen him in at least 5 years since he moved to Europe for his job.  But I said sure, and suggested we go to Disney World as I had just renewed my annual pass.  When Billy arrived at my house it was like no time had passed between us.  We were back to laughing and joking just like we had when we were kids.  I drove us over to Disney World, and we set out on our adventure.  First we went on Space Mountain - I think Billy screamed more than I did.  We went on Big Thunder Railroad, and laughed like kids the entire time.  We went over to Epcot for a food tour - we both liked the Japananese food, and the beers in the Germany area.  We reminisced about the old times growing up, and our parents.  Billy shared with me that he still wasn't ready to settle down, but did have a girlfriend in London who sounded lovely.  We watched a parade, hugged Mickey Mouse, and even saw the fireworks show in the evening.  At the end of our day we drove home, and talked about making this an annual adventure for the two of us.  That was the last time I saw Billy.  A week after our Disney World adventure, Billy was killed in a car accident in London.  I still haven't accepted the fact that this was our last adventure together.  I would give anything to have that day back and re-live it over and over.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26SESKUQ
