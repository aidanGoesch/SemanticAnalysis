I quit temporarily at the job. Things haven't improved, since I got back. I will get another job when I can. The boss is so mean. He always insults the workers. He called me slow and stupid for being a second late on a project. I was so mad and complained to human resources anonymously. This made him wise up to not being insulting to his workers. I was glad he got reprimanded. The other workers are alright. They aren't too mean but I wished they would smile more. Can't say why they should smile more in this work environment. The pay is alright. I will definitely get out of here one day.",,3N8OEVH1FSCLO6F77J3BHTRQBNQOOA
