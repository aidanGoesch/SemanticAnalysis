There were a number of things that built up to cause this. I had been under a great deal of stress for quite some time. I didn't feel like I was getting any backup or support from my manager or the owner of the company. There was a week when it seemed like everything bad came together all at once. I was sexually harassed by an employee who exposed himself to me and had another employee accuse me of sexually harassing them. I also loaned someone money, only to have them disappear. This all happened around the time of my birthday, when I didn't have a single person to wish me a happy birthday. So, one day, I snapped and quit. I was unemployed for about three weeks. Finally, my employer asked me to come back. Things haven't really gotten any better, but I'm looking for something else. I am hopeful that something will come along and that things will get better for me. They haven't yet, but I guess there is always hope. Last week my employer announced that he was stopping payment of commissions, so there's one more thing that stinks about this job. I hope I get out of here soon.",,3N8OEVH1FSCLO6F77J3BHTRQBNQOOA
