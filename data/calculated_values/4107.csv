I have never been very good at it, however I am willing to attempt it.  This is a story about my family and I moving. A month and one week ago my family and I moved out of the state about 4.5 hours away.  We don't have any family in the area or know anyone here. It's something that we had been planning for quite some time.  We did a lot of research online and looked all over the country.  We made a budget to save a certain amount of money each week. After doing a lot of homework we figured out what would be enough money to cover all the moving costs and everything that goes with relocating 4.5 hours away.  We are living our dream and cannot be happier.  We are still saving money as we want to purchase our own land and build a house within the next year or so.  Some of the more memorable things about the move that I will never forget the rest of my life include but are not limited to it being the hottest most humid day of the year up until that point, and it hasn't reached those temperatures since and my friends and I had to load a 26' U-Haul while dripping sweat and complaining the whole time. We hooked up the truck to the trailer with the car on it at 9 PM and departed for our new home. About 5 minutes after we took off my girlfriend and I's favorite song came over the radio and we smiled and held each others hand as we continued on our journey. As I have said, it's something that we have been looking forward to for a long time, and we couldn't be happier thus far with our decision.",3N8OEVH1FSCLO6F77J3BHTRQJBIOOM,
