My boyfriend works as a dog groomer and 2 weeks ago his boss agreed to keep a dog kenneled at his place of business for a few days.  The dog was left out in an open area walled off with dog-gates. Before leaving for the night, my boyfriend put a leash on the dog so that it wouldn't jump over the gate when no one was around.  My boyfriends boss was supposed to close up for the night and let the dog off of it's' leash before leaving but unfortunately did not do so. The dog ended up jumping over the gate with its leash on and passing away. Since the business wasn't licensed to kennel dogs overnight, the business owners are facing a serious issue. My boyfriend has been told to stay home during this entire ordeal and is worried that he could face legal consequences because he was the one who left the dog on a leash. He is worried that he could lose his job over this and that would really hurt us financially since he gets paid very well for what he has to do. We are worried that we won't be able to keep up with the rent if this situation gets dragged out for an extended period. He has been working freelance gigs in the meantime by working for food delivery services but the work isn't consistent and doesn't pay that well. On top of that, we don't know how long he can keep it up since he is having car troubles as well. I work a full-time job as well but even with what I earn paying all of the bills can be a struggle. My boyfriend has also been looking into getting his real-estate certification so that he has an actual career to fall back on. We're both hoping that the dog owner doesn't take any legal action and that my boyfriend's boss doesn't get into any trouble for taking in a dog when he shouldn't have.",,3N8OEVH1FSCLO6F77J3BHTRQUUOOO5
