The whole extended family was there. Hugs and handshakes, high fives for the bigger kids. We started with a cheese and crackers platter, fruit bowl and everybody pretty much brought something for the buffet. There was so much food it made me feel a little guilty even about those they don't have enough to eat. The kids were in the back yard playing ball, some were exploring the wooded area, others were on the swing set. It was almost like a school playground there were so many of them. One little girl exclaimed look a family of deer. All the kids stopped to look at the mommy deer and her 3 fawns, so majestic. The screeching of the kids drove the deer away and it was back to playing. The adults were enjoys the food and the drinks were flowing freely. Lots of beer, wine and liquor. My niece made a pitcher of mojitos and a pitcher of margaritas. At this point everybody was feeling pretty good. My brother in law had drank a few to many and then the yelling started. ""MAGA"" was yelled out by him at my nieces husband from Mexico ""build the wall"", ""go back where you came from"". Now some of the other men stepped in as hands were going to be thrown. My brother in law was restrained and my niece was in tears. Her husband walked out and slammed the front door as he left. Now my sister is screaming at my brother in law,  ""just shut up, this happens every time you drink"", ""you ruin everything"" and then she started crying too. My sister and niece hugged each ""I hate dad"" she exclaimed. My brother stormed off to the basement to get away from the drama. The kids resumed their play. The adults were all talking about what a jerk my brother in law is, even though the party is at his house. I felt bad for him, bad for my niece and sorry for my sister.",,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAPZS26PT
