I did not sleep at during the night, I tried but I could not. My girlfriend has been away for three days now, I have been calling her in vain, her phone rings and she sends me straight to voicemail. I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me ""his"" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is. All in all, life has to go on and I have to keep my head high, I will try however hard it is. Maybe next time I will love with my head and not my head, there could have been red flags but I was too blind to see.",,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2S31727E
