I ran ahead to our seats and snuck both the dolls into his seat so they were waiting for him when he came up the aisle to his seat. He was absolutely mystified how they got there and the look in his eyes was absolutely magical. Overall, he really enjoyed the movie, and it was amazing seeing him sitting there with buzz and woody. He even talked to them once in a while about the movie as it was going on. We also had food brought to the seats, which he thought was awesome. My daughter enjoyed the popcorn, which blew my mind. My son is quite particular about food, but they had macaroni and cheese, which he loves. He really enjoyed sitting back in the electronic reclining chairs and watching the movie with us. At a few parts he got a little loud, but he's only three so we were not expecting too much from him, honestly. We went during a matinee so we were some of the only people in the theater. I can't wait for my daughter to be old enough to be able to go to the movies so we can surprise both of them like that more. It was a great runner-up to taking my son to disney. He knows he likes the characters and is excited to see them. My daughter won't really be old enough to understand yet, but we will be getting her some characters as well. We have breakfast planned with the princesses, which she will hopefully recognize.",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SJ6P72R,
