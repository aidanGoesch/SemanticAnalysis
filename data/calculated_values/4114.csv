He's been really into those movies and toys lately and so we thought we would surprise him with seeing the movie. My wife and I don't ever really go to the movies together, nothing good has come out lately and it's been a long time since we were teenagers going every friday. Nowadays, you can actually reserve seats and order food; you can get there 30 seconds before the movie starts, have your seats and have your food delivered to you. It cost almost $75 for the three of us, but it was worth it for him to have a fun day out. He really enjoyed seeing the movie with us, and had a blast seeing all the characters. In addition to the movie, I decided to have a surprise for him. He's been saying he wanted a buzz lightyear for himself, so I ordered one off amazon and hid it in the car. When we got into the movie, my wife told him someone wanted to see the movie with him. His eyes really lit up when she took the buzz out. He held him and sat with him through the whole movie. I think I even, at one point, saw him talking to buzz, telling him something about the movie. It was really one of my favorite moments. We have a younger daughter who wouldn't do well at the movies yet, but it really makes me think about how much fun the two of them will be together. Hopefully they will both grow up liking almost the same movies!",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SJ6P72R,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SJ6P72R
