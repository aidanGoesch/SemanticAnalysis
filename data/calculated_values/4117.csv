I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not even relax. Today was one of those days where either I get up, or I get up. I then decided to go outside, but because it was raining, I got wet. I went back inside, felt tired enough to go back to bed, but I still had to change out of my wet clothes. Then I got a phone call from you know who. I got so excited that I didn’t care that I was naked, tired, and there was a puddle on the floor. We are going on a date this Friday. I don’t know how I’m going to sleep. What am I going to wear? :naked dance: :singing in the rain: oh diary, one day I’ll look back on this and say remember when I didn’t pay attention to anything but the phone ringing. life is good I tell you. It should be lived to the fullest always. Something that Ii can be proud to say for sure. Cant wait for the next time.",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SL7F27G,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SL7F27G
