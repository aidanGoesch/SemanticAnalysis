She had developed a brain tumor and was on the verge of death anyway. It was very sad since she was only a few years old. She had previously been very energetic and well-behaved. She was a great companion dog. It will not be easy to replace her with another dog. It is particularly hard for me because I don't have a large social network, especially at home. I don't have any siblings. I also don't feel all that close to my friends. I am liked by everyone because I fit in everywhere. But since I don't have a particular group that I focus on, I don't develop deep relationships. My dog provided me with the steady presence I needed. I don't like the temporary nature of relationships today. I want something to last. My dog was unquestioningly loyal to me and would have been for many years in the future. But it turned into another short-term friendship.",,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SM1Z72U
