We got together and it was a lot of fun.  We did not schedule a whole lot of things to do and just relaxed. It was a lot of playing with the kids and visiting with my siblings.  We cooked a lot of good food and had drinks a few times.  It was fun for the siblings to get together at night after the kids went to bed to reminisce.  We saw some deer pretty close to us one time and the kids were able to see them up close.  We would also take bike rides.  We went out to eat a couple times and the places were really good. It is good to see the family again and catch up.  We try not to leave too long of a time between visits because time just slips by.  I had a good relationship with a lot of my uncles growing up and would like to have the same with my nephews and neices. It is also nice to get together with my family and talk about old times and our lives now.  We have always been pretty close and it feels good to have that relationship.,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAPZS26PT,
