I had other offers that actually paid more money. I took this one because it paid less but had more opportunity for growth. The owners are this really nice little couple from Texas. They seemed very very sweet. I enjoyed their pitch to me about what the chances were of success and how poised they were to pay ore in the future pending it all went well. I liked this a lot and their energy. I was happy to meet them and I thought about it long and hard. After a few days I decided to take it. When I started a week later I realized what a mess things were in terms of strategy. I had this idea of starting a new product line. A series of denim jackets for men women and children. We searched for a long time for supplies and places that could help us with it. We found  a great one and managed to have some prototypes made. We sold them locally at first and they were a hit. We then launched them via our website and this product alone has single-handedly turned this business around. I am happy that it all worked out.,,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SU6X72A
