I work for a transit company, and we provide the only real mass transit in my city. Recently we launched an exciting new BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) line. This route has been in planning for years, and ever since I started working here I've been involved with planning, tracking, outreach, etc. It was exciting to launch it, we had the news here, tons of people, 200 volunteers from the city, and all sorts of other things. We had live bands playing at some of the stops, a DJ at the transit center, and a ribbon cutting at city hall. The exciting part about this line is that it uses a fleet of full electric vehicles, they emit almost no pollutants, and are extremely quiet. There were some hiccups. Ridership was much higher than we anticipated, so the buses were going much slower than intended. Usually the buses will run every 10 minutes, the whole line should take about an hour and a half to complete a full round trip. The line runs North to South, and we were pushing 35-45 minute wait times. The buses were so packed that we eventually had to turn people away if it was too full. After the launch we received some complaints due to timing issues. We fixed those by adding more buses to the routes. Another complaint we had was that bus stations (these are center lane stations) were causing congestion, so we improved traffic light switches for bus only lanes, to minimize the time at each stop. The city was excited and came out in force, and it made all the hard work worth it. I feel like we dropped the ball in some places, but man we did our best, and I'm so proud of my team and myself. We did some fun activities that entire week, and we have some other fun stuff in the works. I can't wait for the future lines, we have two more lines coming in the next 4-5 years.",,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SU6X72A
