The first birthday without my brother not going to see his smile today I keep saying to myself, not going to hear his laugh I keep reminding myself. I Thank God it is the weekend I don't think I could make it into work today, I can't stop crying this feeling is horrible.  My thoughts are crisp and clear my memories are swarming through my mind and all I keep thinking about is how will I get through this day, My alarm keeps blaring next to my head I have no energy to turn it off as I smack my alarm and the beeping stops. My phone rings again for the 5th time this morning I notice my mother and grandmother keep calling.  I am dreading the day, oh God make this day just go away I don't want o face my family. After a few hours of drifting in out of sleep I hear my doorbell ring, darn now I gotta get out of bed.  I stumble down the stairs and notice my front door opening I stop and look and see a bunch of balloons soar through the door from the outside winds. What the hell I thought to myself not this shit, my Grandma and Mom were standing there smiling and crying at the same time screaming Happy Birthday. Their voices were like nail pounding into my already aching head, but I smile as I make my way toward them. I give them both big hugs and kisses and help them carry presents and bags inside the house. We make our way into my living room and sit in silence for few minutes all felling sort of down but happy.  I offered them coffee otr a drink and then we started to talk about my brother and remembered some happy memories. We all smiled and cried again for the 10th time in an hour, I notice the time is 2om now damn the day is flying by I tought. They then told me some other family is coming over and they are bringing food I hope I can eat I thought. My mom then gave me a huge box to open that was wrapped with Happy Birthday wrapping paper.  I rip the paper open and notice it was a gaming PC i have been looking at getting for a long time. I can't believe she knew to get me this, my wife must of told her, I love her.  I felt happy in that moment and the pain went away for a few minutes but then reality hit immediately again and I started crying. My mother hugged me as the doorbell rang my Grandma opened the door and my aunts and uncles were rushing in with tons of food and presents for me. I could at least say I have a great family, we all come together to comfort each other.",,3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZIC2TYOFK
