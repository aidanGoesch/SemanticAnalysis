The treatment was difficult but I was very glad to find out I was in remission. This last week my doctor informed me that I had reached the five year mark in my remission. Most with my type of cancer only survive about a year and a half. I beat the odds and am so excited about it. I am grateful for the care I got and now I only have to go for check ups once a year instead of every three months. It is hard to explain how much this means to me, I have an opportunity to see my grandchildren and children grow up. I am excited to plan for the future. You don't really plan for anything when you are going through treatment. You just think about what to do to try to help yourself. I spent a lot of time thinking about preparing my children for my passing. I did not want them to be sad too long. I wanted them to keep it simple and try not to hold on to any sadness. I wanted them to remember the happy memories. I have four amazing kids so they are them most important thing to me.",3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICRA9FO9,3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICRA9FO9
