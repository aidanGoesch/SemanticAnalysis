I met my girlfriend near the beginning of the year and we have really hit it off and get along well.  I hadn't met any of her family and they had been hearing a lot about me, as well as seeing me a lot on her Facebook. So she said they really wanted to meet sometime soon.  I was a little nervous but I knew it was important to her and I agreed.  They suggested getting together to meet for a nice weekend sometime because they are too far away to just meet for a quick dinner.  Because they live in Massachusetts, and I live in upstate New York, it was decided to meet in Vermont which is about halfway for each of us.  I was a little bit nervous because I am introverted and quiet around new people, but I wanted to make a good impression.  But luckily, it went really well and everyone ended up having a great time.  We walked around town after having Mexican and got to talk a lot.  And I got to learn more about my girlfriend's time growing up and her family, which was nice.  And we also did a brief hike to see some flowers.  After dinner, we got together and played a board game which was a lot of fun too.  Overall, it was a really pleasant experience and I wasn't nervous.  They are even visiting New York for Thanksgiving which I'm really looking forward to now.",3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICRAHOFQ,
