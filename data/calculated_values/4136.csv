THIS DEVELOPMENT WAS A LARGE PROJECT. WINNING THE JOB WOULD MEAN SIGNIFICANT REVENUES TO OUR COMPANY. WE ARE PRIVATELY OWNED AND THE OWNER PICKED A GROUP TO PREPARE THE PROPOSAL. THERE WAS A TEAM OF THREE. I WAS SELECTED AS THE TEAM LEADER. WE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS PREPARING THE PROPOSAL. I FELT GOOD OUT THE FINAL PRESENTATION BECAUSE I FELT IT WAS FAIR TO THE OTHER COMPANY AND MY COMPANY. WE PRESENTED IT TO THE OWNER AND HE FELT IT WAS NOT AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH. THE CHANGES HE SUGGESTED MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO EARN A PROFIT AND I KNEW IT. I TRIED TO CHANGE HIS OPINION BUT I GAVE UP. WE WON THE PROPOSAL AND THE FINANCIAL LOSS WE SUFFERED CAUSED THE COMPANY TO LAY OFF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. MY FRIENDS AND COWORKERS LOST THEIR JOB. I FEEL AWFUL I DID NOT STAND MY GROUND AND GAVE IN SO EASILY. I AM ASHAMED AND EMBARRASSED TO THIS DAY. THE OWNER TOOK NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR HIS INPUT AND PUT THE BLAME FOR THE FAILURE OF THE PROJECT ON MY. I WAS SO ANGRY THAT I HAD TO LIVE WITH THIS SHAME.,3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICTZEFOU,
