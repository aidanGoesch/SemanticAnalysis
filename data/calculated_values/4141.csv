I can still remember the day when we met. It is not love at first sight like the movies show us. It all started back in school. We were classmates in college and our love story started from what other people may consider as the most boring way - through friendship. But if you were to ask me, it is not boring. It feels safe and secure since our relationship is founded on trust that we cultivated for a long time as friends. He actually did have a girlfriend before. They even have a kid - a kid who is very dear to my heart, Sam. Anyway, we were celebrating our third anniversary recently and we planned to do it in a park. We both wanted to have a picnic together with Sam. So that day, while we were setting up for the picnic, he suggested that we play a game. He said that while I was busy preparing, he hid something in grass nearby. He asked me and Sam to look for it and the first one to find it will have another scoop of ice cream. So, Sam and I did look for it and when I found it, I saw it has a note with Sam's drawing and the words: ""Will you be my Dad's wife?"". I was so shocked but what I didn't expect is when I turned around to face my boyfriend, he was already in his knees and our closest family and friends are standing a little further behind him with a banner saying: ""Will you marry me?"".",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660I2RLWLB
