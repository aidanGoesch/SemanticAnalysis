We had a fun Saturday with his son and a few of our friends, then we went home - which isn't typically we usually stay the night because we've had a few too many drinks and we never drive like that. He didn't drink, which wasn't strange at the time but looking back I realize he chose not to so he could drive us home. The next day he suggested we go for a bike ride and a picnic, which is not unusual - we do this most weekends when we have free time.  We ride to the park where we picnic often. He suggested we bring my new metal detector - he bought one for my birthday - a new hobby I am loving! I asked him to hid a coin for his son to hide, I wanted his son to get into my new hobby and he agreed (this was before we left).  We have our picnic and begin to ""hunt""  but the metal detector wasn't working properly and I was getting flustered. He kept asking me to go to where he hid the coin but I was trying to teach his son the right way to detect. We finally get to where he buried to coin and there is a trail of white rocks that lead to heart? shaped circle type thing - I thought it was so his son could find the ring easier - which at the time I thought was so silly because his son is 7 and super smart. Then he asked me to dig in the hole and now I am upset bc his son is meant to find the damn coin! So I finally agree after we go back and forth and there is a box - I hand it to his son to open bc I thought his dad put the coin in the box - again it was so silly bc he is 7!I ask his son what is in the box and he says ""coins and this folded piece of paper"". He hands me a piece of printer paper that was folder a few times and I open it up - in his son's handwriting is read "" Will you Marry me? "" and there were a few cute drawings of his dad and me. I began to cry and I turned my head and my boyfriend was kneeling down, with a ring in his hand and I covered my face because I was so ashamed of how silly I was acting and I almost ruined the sweetest proposal in the world.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660I2RLWLB
