I'm still surprised that Michael chose the Conservation Park as his birthday experience this year, but I guess I shouldn't be.  He's always taken after me and Mom in our love of all animals.  His father and I drove him down last evening and we stayed at the local Hilton.  He's not too old, yet, to be tickled with the hotel swimming pool.  We also found an all-you-can-eat buffet near there that had chicken tenders and french fries.  He can still eat so much!  It's no wonder he's over 6 feet tall!  Best of all, Allie came home from college just to join us and surprised him.  The way his face lit up as he caught sight of her made this mother's heart just sing.  I'm so glad they're growing closer to each other as they get older.  I'm still amazed they never actually killed each other growing up.  I think that Michael is giving serious consideration about going into wildlife conservation as his college major.  I've noticed him taking a bigger interest in his biology class and he's been spending more time volunteering at the animal shelter, too.  They're just growing up way too quickly.  I love them so much but it makes me sad to let them go.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660I2T2WLW
