It's kind of a big deal, since he turned 14. I came up with the idea to celebrate at the local wild animal conservation park, and invite his sister, who is grown and out of the house. He loved the idea. We were a little worried it might rain, as the weather seemed to be turning that way. But as the day neared the rain in the forecast was pushed off, beyond the weekend, leaving the day warm and sunny. My daughter was able to attend, so that ensured he'd have a great day. They're close, and he misses her. On the day of, we had cake first, in a picnic area outside the village. Then we went in and he got to show his sister around, sharing his favorite things with her. She hadn't been in a while, and we've been going often, so it was new to her and he loved sharing his favorite sights and experiences. We even got to see the lions, which doesn't always happen, and a cheetah was on display, which also isn't guaranteed. The occupants of all of the big cat exhibits were sunning themselves on a lazy afternoon. It was fantastic. The weather was lovely and the kids had a blast. It was a wonderful day. It's been my happy thought ever since. I think of it often.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660I2T2WLW
