The competition had been arranged by the board of directors. The winner was to receive an unknown prize. We were all anxious to see the prize. I was so excited because I had done my research  well. My colleagues and I made a presentation to the board of directors. We were then evaluated and amazingly, my presentation was selected as the best. I was so happy remembering when one of the directors asked a challenging question that I had not expected. I got a promotion from the top rating. I got so excited and happy that I managed to beat all my competitors. I called my family and broke the news. They were all excited and happy for me. My mother arranged a party to celebrate. I invited my friends too. I had fun and everyday I dedicate the promotion to myself and my mum who helped me research.  I am still excited on getting a promotion  because I never expected one.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660IQEKWL8
