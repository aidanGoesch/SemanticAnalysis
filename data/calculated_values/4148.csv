I just shrugged it off and went on with everyday life.  That is, until the pain became too much and was interferring with my life.  I went to emergency room and had a few tests ran.  They also did a sonogram on my leg to see if they could figure out what was causing the pain.  Once they got the results, I was informed that I had a blood clot in the main artery in my leg.  I was immediately admitted to the hospital and started on an i.v. to thin my blood.  I was confined to the bed for a week to make sure that the clot did not move.  The damage to my leg was severe.  It looked like major road construction had been done on my veins.  I also had to learn to walk on that leg again.  I couldn't do the normal things I had before this happened.  I had to be careful not to cut or bruise myself while on blood thinners.  This was not easy as I have a grandchild to take care of during the day.  It sucks learning to live differently that I had been, all because of a stupid blood clot.  I'm ready to be normal again.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660ISWMLW1
