I signed up and arrived early. They had already started to paint the base coat of white on the street. It was my time to help paint. I choose to help paint the sun beams. The sun was starting to come up and it was going to be a very hot day but the fun of painting in the street helped to make you forget all of that. I soon finished with the help of others the sun beams. I then noticed the manatee. I mixed some paint and started to paint it. A young girl was wanting to help paint too so I offered to share the manatee. I directed her to where the paint and brushes were located. She had a great time helping. I had to re-paint the lines that outlined the manatee since they were a little off. It looked amazing and I had a great feeling to know that I could drive by the mural and see my manatee that we painted. It also made me encouraged o do more  paintings in the future.,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,
