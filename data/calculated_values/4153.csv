I had decided to volunteer to help paint. I signed up for the morning shift and arrived a bit early.  They had started to paint the street with primer for where the design would be painted. While I waited for that to be finished, I signed in so that the city could keep track of the amount of volunteer hours that everyone preformed. I then was instructed to have some of the donuts and water that had been brought. As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road. I was told that they lived on the block. I went back to get my camera and take a few pictures of the chickens and the beginning of the artwork. I finished taking the pictures and they were ready for me to start helping. I found a paint roller and chose to start with painting the yellow rays of sunlight. It took a couple hours but it looked great. I had wanted to paint a part of the mural that I could come back and say, I did that. I decided to paint the manatee. It had already been drawn so I got the grey paint mixed and started to paint it. A young girl, who was visiting the neighborhood, asked to help paint. I directed her to where there were more paint brushes and she soon came back. It was a fun time painting the manatee. The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted. When I was finished with the outline, it looked great and everyone was really happy with it. I then took a picture of it and went home happily knowing that there was a manatee painted on that street by me.",3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81
