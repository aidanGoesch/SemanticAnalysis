We have been kayaking and canoeing before. But this is the first time we have been on this particular river and we were excited. It was especially exciting because my oldest son was bringing his significant other along as his fiance. He had asked her just the week before. So myself and my husband got a double kayak, my son and his fiance got a double kayak and my youngest son got a single kayak. It was a 4 hour trip which we did in about 3 because the youngsters didn't let the old folks slack. My husband did not know how to steer the dang kayak so there was some yelling until we kind of got the gist of it. He is lucky he didn't get a oar up side of his head! Next time I am going to get a single kayak! We all got to talk and laugh with each other while we paddled down the river. The best thing is that they really couldn't get away from us so they had to spend time with old ma and pa. Not that they didn't want to anyway. They even got to see me fall in the river as clumsy me tried to climb back into the kayak. This was after I pulled the kayak through a shallow part with my husband in it! We got sunburned, we were tired and I ached from physical exercise. Basically, it was a great day spent as a family that we don't get enough anymore.",,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GFZ58PS
