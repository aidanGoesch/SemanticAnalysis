However, unlike a normal job, I worked third shift. It was pretty dark out this night, whereas the moonlight would usually light my way. That being said, driving conditions were a bit below optimal. On top of that, I was tired from working most of the night. About half way through the drive home, A large semi truck pulled out in front of me from an intersection not too far ahead. I could tell instantly that he did not see me coming, and I slammed on my breaks. Unfortunately, It was too late. I slid right into him at about 30 miles per hour, right on the front left of my car to the corner of his back bumper. My left shoulder and arm were fractured, but my car was completely destroyed. I was devastated, I had never been in an accident before this. I really had no idea what would happen if I would even be able to get to work the next day. The truck driver got out and told me he works for Coca Cola. He said he had to call his supervisor in to bring insurance information, and to get mine. I called the police and reported the accident while waiting for the supervisor to show up. Once the supervisor was there, we exchanged insurance information, and I asked him if he could give me a ride home. Luckily, he said yes. It wasn't even until the next day that I realized how serious my injuries were. My shoulder and arm received 2 different types of fractions from hitting the dashboard. I woke up with immense pain, feeling unable to go to work that night. I went to an urgent care facility at around 6 pm and they knew right away my left arm and shoulder were either broken or fractured, or both. I set up an appointment with a doctor, and eventually ended up with a cast for 9 months. All in all, I am glad I had the experience because my injuries hurt very bad, but they weren't severe enough to change my life for the worse. I learned a lesson I won't forget.",3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ805V1PK,
