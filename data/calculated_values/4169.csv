I have been accustomed to some level of violence, growing up in an impoverished neighborhood... but this, was different. About 4 weeks ago, I was struck by an oncoming vehicle in a high speed accident. It happened so quickly, that I initially thought I was okay. It wasn't til about 30 seconds after the accident that I realized the side of my shoulder and my arm had 2 severe gashes. These weren't scrapes or cuts, but inch deep wounds that were 2 inches in length. I panicked, never imagined the reality of injuries that bad to myself. No one else was injured somehow, even though the other persons vehicle had 3 people in it, and I was just by myself.  If I would have had a passenger, they would have likely been hit on their left arm and possibly had organ damage near the chest area. By the time I got to the hospital, I already lost a lot of blood and felt dizzy. I was awake the entire time they were stitching my arm and shoulder but I had a painkiller shot. I remember feeling interested in the wound after I got the painkiller shot and it was being stitched up. I'm thankful that nobody else was injured, and that I wasn't killed or permanently injured. Although, it did end up being the other drivers fault, and his insurance had to buy me a new car because mine was totaled. This was one of the most traumatic experiences that has ever happened to me in my life. That being said, I would feel way worse about it, if someone intentionally did it to me. It really isn't that bad if things just happen, even if I suffer immensely, as long as I get to live and breathe another day.",3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ805V1PK,3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ805V1PK
