Plus the fact she's not sure what kind of gift he would like.  Since her husband and I talk about a lot of things and we have so much in common, she thought it be best if I pick out the gift. The day she gave me the money, I had put it in my wallet, and left my wallet sitting on my dresser.  That same night, a friend of mine had come over, saying he wanted to talk.  He's been having financial problems lately do to the fact that he has gotten addicted to pain medication.  He came over, and we talked for quite some time.  He said he needed to use the bathroom, which is located next to my room, I only have one bathroom.  As he went into the bathroom, he saw my wallet sitting on my dresser, which is located near my bedroom door, which you can clearly see as you go into the bathroom.  He went into my room, got into my wallet and took the money, then went into the bathroom.  After he was done, he suddenly said he had forgotten something he had to do, and had to leave.  We talked for about 2-3 minutes more, and he left.  After he left, I finished a few things around the house that I needed to do and finally went to my bedroom.  As I was getting ready for bed, I noticed that my wallet was not in the same spot that I had placed it earlier.  I opened it and saw that the $800 was gone.  I was furious and hurt.  I tried calling my friend, but he never answered.  I went to bed angry and hurt.  The next day, I tried calling my friend again, and no answer.  I thought about calling the police, but decided not to.  I realized  that I will have to pay for my sister's husband gift myself.  So I went looking for the gift, found a nice tablet that he would like, and paid for it on my credit card.  I never told my sister what happened, and am no longer friends with the friend who stole the money.",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AAMO3AQ
