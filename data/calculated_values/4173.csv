It was a long time in coming and I fought it along the way, but to no avail. Even though I was injured, I really felt that I would be able to go back to duty with enough PT and rest. I'm still young and feel like I have a lot to contribute. I always did not job to the best of my ability and got many commendations. I'm still so surprised that the military didn't have my back. It's been really rough not having a job to go to, to not feel useful, and to not be my old self. I spent too much time and money trying to reverse this process. It was long and draining and in the end I didn't prevail. I wonder if I made the right decision because perhaps it might have been better to just accept the decision from the get go. Then I might have moved on by now instead of dwelling on everything that happened. I have my good days and I have my bad days and I'm hopeful I'll be fully recovered at some point. I need to earn some money already. Keeping my fingers crossed! I still have a lot to offer. Sitting home just me and my dog is driving me crazy.",,3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ82USP1L
