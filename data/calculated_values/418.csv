She asked me to do so on her behalf, because it was a surprise gift for their anniversary, and she did not want him to know that she was doing it.  The afternoon that she gave me the money, I went home and put it in my desk drawer, with intentions of depositing it in my bank the following day so that I could make the purchase.  Later that evening, I had a friend come over who was having some problems with her boyfriend.  We talked to each other and caught up and she asked if she could use my computer, which I of course said yes.  I was on the phone with my husband who was out of town and in a different room while she was on the computer.  Shortly thereafter, she suddenly had to leave and her reason behind it was unclear and sounded suspicious, but knowing her I summed it up to she was lying about what she was really going to do and I didn't really care too much.  The next day I was getting ready to leave to go to the bank and I opened up my desk drawer and the money was gone!  I checked my wallet and purse to see if for some reason I had put it in there, although I know for a fact that I never moved it. I immediately knew that she had stolen the money from me, and her wishy-washy excuse for leaving now made perfect sense. I was furious. I called her immediately and she did not answer.  I called her 3 more times and she still did not answer.  So I sent her a text message and pretended like everything was ok so that she would call me back. She called me back and I asked her if she took the money.  She claimed to not know what I was talking about and tried to blame it on my kids (who were all asleep when she was there) and I could sense that she was lying yet again.  There was not much that I could do at this point but to write her off as a friend and know that she could not be trusted.  This was extra hurtful to me because I now had to come up with $800 of my own money to pay for the tickets since I was the person trusted to do this.  I struggle financially as it is, so $800 is a lot of money to me.",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AAMO3AQ
