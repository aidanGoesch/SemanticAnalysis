This position is a career path that I hadn't necessarily thought of in my youth, but I did always have it in my mind that I wanted to be a direct help to my community, either through police work, fire work or other service aspect. Following my son's birth in May 2018, I talked to my wife about these aspirations as it was a far cry from what I am currently doing. She was thrilled to hear about this idea despite the dangers the career path could put me on. I started the lengthy process that summer which consisted of detailed applications, written tests and the latest step, the CPAT. The CPAT process started this summer, around May 2019. There were several opportunities to prepare and pass the test, yet I kept falling short. What was encouraging, aside from my wife, was that each leg of the process I was getting better. While I wouldn't pass during the attempts nor the practices, I was able to improve a little each time without any regression. On my final attempt, I was beyond nervous. The difference between passing and failing this test was the difference between continuing on my path versus waiting THREE YEARS to try again. Needing to put my family in a financially stable position, failing was not an option. I buckled down and drove through that test to the best of my ability, finishing with just under 40 seconds left on the clock. I still was not where I want to be physically, but I passed which is all that they were concerned with. I remember how elated I was; despite being in a ""job interview"" so to speak, I let my emotions out and screamed ""F*** YEAH!"" and I got a chuckle from firefighter instructors. I immediately called my wife to share the exciting news and we celebrated the events with a nice lunch. It was difficult to process what I had just achieved, but with the passing time I have a real sense of success with my achievement.",3NJM2BJS4XS20HU5WE7ZBT2Z6RGCPV,
