I didn't have the chance to really until just recently. About four months ago I took the plunge. I decided to visit a friend who I had known for a while and felt comfortable flying across the Atlantic for. I traveled from the US all the way to London, England. Traveling this distance was a bit nerve-wracking, but at no point did the nerves outweigh the excitement I had for this event. I seriously just was so excited and I couldn't imagine backing out now. After a lengthy flight, I met the friend and even though I had nerves meeting them too, I was still really excited to hang out with them. I wanted to hang out with them for a long time. I just couldn't believe it was happening. When we met, it was exciting and fresh and new. I couldn't believe I was so fortunate to be in the position that I was in. I got to see all of the sights, experience the food, and just spend some time in a culture that is different than mine. I encourage everyone to go through this if they can. It's an experience not soon forgotten.",,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GQ91UDJ
