This was a special event for us because we don't usually talk much and it was an experience where I believe we tried to strengthen our relationship that got, in a way, corroded over the years - it was a blast! Not only because of the scenery which was amazing, but because I learned to appreciate my dad as well as be more patience towards him and accept his ""shticks"" as I am sure I have them too. He was very proud of me for planning the trip so perfectly to make sure we go to the right places and not miss a thing. We started our trip in San Francisco and drove all night to Yosemite. Then we planned to go to Bristlecone Pine Forest, Death Valley, Las Vegas, Grand Canyon, Monument Valley, Antelope Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Zion Park and back to Las Vegas and all along to road visited other various attractions. Even though I planned it, it was semi spontaneous trip with food, lodging etc. Many of these places are places I only dreamed of or saw in the movies and I am know that my dad was in awe of everything. We took tons of photos and sadly the video camera didn't record anything, even though we thought it was recording - apparently there was some defect in it. Regardless, my dad keeps talking about places we've been and things we've seen and he's keep referring back to the photos (he even print some of them on canvas to hang in his house).You see, my dad lives overseas so this trip was more than just bonding experience, it was first time I have to see him for a very very long time. For us, it was an amazing experience, a once in a lifetime. We decided to try and meet up at least once a year. We hope to try an mimic the experience in the near future, for a different destination. We know it won't be the same but it can be at par or an even better experience.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GY6FDUI,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GY6FDUI
