On paper he left me but as i look back at our marriage i checked out a long time ago. I am still trying to make sense of it all. Why I chose to married this person? Why me? Its all still there. My bruises haven't quite healed yet. Well, something happened in the store today that triggered everything that i've been trying to get over for the past couple of months. As i was waiting in line at the grocery store i saw a man shoving a female, who was probably his wife or girlfriend into a car. He was screaming at her and we all can hear it from the store. It all just brought back memories of.. yeah, that was me a few months ago. So i've been sitting here going thru all of it in my mind again. What hurts the most from what i remember is not the final divorce procedure with the lawyers but the day he gave me divorce papers. Are you kidding me? Your the one who constantly used me, abused me, and shouted at me when i did anything you didn't like. I guess i have regret and that's what bothering me today. The regret that i should of divorced this person a long time ago.  It feels he got the last laugh in this whole mess. I also felt i needed to write about it so it doesn't build up inside of me. That's what my friends keep telling me. They've been very supportive of me, especially Karen. I am lucky to have such a friend. I did feel hope today. A very attractive man smiled at me today and he made me blush a little. That's something right?",,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GZ8YUDN
