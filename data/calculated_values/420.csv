The process was long and grueling. We saw tons of houses in our area. We have never been so overwhelmed. After seeing about 10 different townhouses/homes, we decided to use a realtor to assist. Jim was great to work with. He knew exactly what we wanted and was immediately able to provide us recommendations. We finally started seeing houses that we really liked. We ended up finding a house and loved it. We put an offer in, but were rejected. as someone else came in with a much stronger offer. We were devastated. However, we didn't realize how lucky we were. Jim showed us one more house. The house was completely redone, in our hometown, and close to two major highways. We were so lucky that we didn't get the prior house as this one was better. We knew as soon as we walked through that this was the one. We put an offer it that was rejected. After some negotiating we provided an offer that was accepted. After a few months of searching diligently, we finally found our house. This was honestly one of the most memorable moments of my entire life. You can only buy your first home one time.",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AAR5A3O
