Perhaps the most prominent one is that I separated from my husband, who a few months later, divorced me. It was very hard on me and I was depressed for a short time. I somehow was able to gain enough strength to get through Spring semester with a 4.0 GPA though. It was memorable because of the pain and heartache that I experienced, but also because of the support that I received and the strength I was able to summon up on my own. I guess I was very surprised by the fact that he was the one to file because he had told me that he would do anything to save our marriage. I left because the relationship was very toxic and verbally/emotionally abusive. We were only married for 8 months after dating for 2 year. The first surprise for me was that I had little signs or red flags that he was going to be this terrible. I saw him get upset a few times, but I justified it of course. Things always escalated quickly when he was angry. He eventually revealed to me other behaviors like punching holes in the wall, throwing things, and constantly blame shifting everything to me. I ultimately left after he was holding a knife a threatening to kill his autistic son because of how annoyed he was with him. I packed up my things while he was at work and I never came back. Even with all the harassment and stalking, I had had enough. I relied on my family and a few close friends who helped me out emotionally and with moving.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GZ8YUDN,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GZ8YUDN
