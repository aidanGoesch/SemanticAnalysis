I saw my sister give birth. I almost fainted but I powered through it. She was in a lot of pain. The baby was beautiful and had the mother's eyes. I saw her cry for a few minutes. Their was nothing wrong with the baby. I hope they have a great life together. I got some baby clothes to help her out with expenses. I wrote to everybody about the news. The whole family was very proud. The whole family met at her house the next week. They all had a great time playing with the baby. Everybody had a tear in their eyes. I definitely had one. I went home later hoping I will have kids one day.",,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CARJK4F
