It was so astonishing to be able to see this powerful action that a woman can do. I remember seeing the pain she was in leading up to finally being able to push her sweet baby out. She was absolutely miserable and I could tell she wanted to hurry up and be able to meet her baby. She had me and her husband switch back and forth between us for rubbing the bottom of her back. Finally it came time for her to push and get this baby out. It was such an amazing experience to see this happen in front of my own eyes. Seeing how a womans body goes from this small little thing to pushing out a 8 pound baby. It was also weird seeing how the baby's little had kind of scrunches up like a cone shape and helps it get through the hole. It is truly inspiring to see a woman go through something like this. Never in my life did I think this was how it happened. It was amazing to watch my sister be so strong in pushing her baby out. I know she was so happy and relieved when he finally made his appearance. I enjoyed so much being able to cheer her on and tell her he was coming. She is such a strong woman.,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CARJK4F,
