I had regarded Phillipa with long-distance loathing since she had pulled off my bathing trunks as a joke 10 years ago. We had been joking about sex, and the sizes of certain people's equipment, and to prove a long-forgotten point her hand yanked down my trunks, and our friends had a hearty laugh at my expense.  I had not seen her since that day. I heard she had spent some time in Australia, working on a research vessel. About 4 months ago some ocean engineering student I know had built an Island in the middle of a lake they had created for a project. to inaugurate the island they were going to throw a party one afternoon. I was invited and I arrived at about 1 PM. the only way to get to that island was on a raft pulled along by a string above. while I was standing around nursing my beer, a darkly tanned blonde woman came up to me and asked me if I remembered her. I looked at her blankly for a moment.""Ph-ph-Phillipa?,"" I stammered. To make a long story short it was. But this was not the Phillipa that I remembered. The Phillipa that I remembered was pudgy, whiny, fat-armed, stoop-shouldered and forgettable. This tall woman was commanding, lanky, graceful, gorgeous and apprised me confidently with the bluest eyes I think I had ever seen. One thing lead to another and we went for a walk along the ocean. The night ended long before the walk did.",,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CIFZK4F
