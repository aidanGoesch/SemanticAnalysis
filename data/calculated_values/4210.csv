In particular it would be my aunt who suffered the worst. We all tried our best to cope with this. My aunt had to worst time as she couldn't focus. She would eventually suffer a nervous break down. She was so stressed that she thought she would die.  We took her to the Dr. they admitted her right away.  This would be the best thing that could happen to her. She got the help she needed. She still is trying to cope today. She did get the best tools to deal with the problem. Many people choose a crutch to get through. She chose the get help. I'm very proud of her. I'm happy she's here.,,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CIHBK4V
