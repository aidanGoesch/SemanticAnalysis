I remember having her, and now shes moving out. Because shes the oldest it was hard saying goodbye as she left the house. I think it might be easier when the younger ones leave but this hit hard. She had to go up last month in july as she was on the soccer team and needed to be moved in mid July. We got a u hual and moved her desk, boxes, and bed as she doesnt plan on coming home too often as it is a bit expensive to travel. We made the 800 mile journey to school and had a lot of fun along the way. We camped at some nice parks, got to see yellowstone, and arches, and finally arrived in california. It was bittersweet watching her get the keys to her own home. Moving her stuff in and setting up her bedroom similar to the way she had it at home because she wanted to be reminded of her childhood home made me tear up. I thought i could make it without crying but I was severely mistaken. We hugged and cried and took her out to dinner before dropping her off at the door to her new apartment. We saw her go through the door and started to drive away. The drive home was quiet but peaceful. I'm so proud of her for making the choice to go to school cross country and follow her dreams. I know she will do great things and am so proud of her.",,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CJ2IK49
