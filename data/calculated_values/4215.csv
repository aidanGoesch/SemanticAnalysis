We then drove to Tempe, AZ to meet her and help her move.  This is such a big step as a parent, having your first move out to an apartment.  It seems so much more important and different than when she moved to the dorm.  The dorm was strictly for two semesters whereas the apartment is a year long lease that ends after her next school year starts.  This is the beginning of her being even more grown up and on her own.  She will most likely never live with us full time ever again.  The moment is filled with pride, seeing how she has grown and going after her dream.  She is an amazing person.  Empathetic, loyal, a great example to her younger siblings, still painfully shy, yet emerging as this fiercely independent young woman who is willing to step out of her comfort zone to overcome the obstacles she encounters, one who knows she has value and a right to be seen as equal.  Last school year her younger sister attended the same college.  They lived in separate wings of the same dorm.  I liked the comfort of knowing she had her best friend available at all times.  This time is different as her sister has decided to change colleges and is at home for this year.  She is off campus, attending events at night where she makes her way to her apartment without the security escort the college has available for those living on campus.  She has worked out a good system to ensure her safety.   She is learning to juggle her studies with the demands of keeping up a living space and shopping and cooking all her meals.  I miss her terribly but am so in awe of this person and I can't wait to see how she conquers the male dominated world she is entering.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CJ2IK49,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CJ2IK49
