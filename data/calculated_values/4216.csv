About a week ago, I was taking Thomas out with me to run some errands. We were at Target, getting some items for the house when I noticed him becoming a little excited. He always reacts near the same way when excited, his therapist said it's called ""stimming"" which is very normal for an autistic person to do when they are overwhelmed. I looked over and saw our old family friend, George, who used to come over quite a bit when Thomas was a teenager. He helped him out or just watched him while I tended chores. It started for I could stop it, Thomas was off. I almost yelled after him, but I didn't want to cause a scene in public. We get enough looks as it is in public. I was... and still am surprised. He was able to carry a conversation with George... surprisingly well. No weird offshoots of random conversation. No repeating a million times over and over the same question or thing. It was almost like the disability had shed his mind for the smallest of moments. I was so proud. Watching him stim lightly and just enjoy the conversation of an old friend. George was proud, and my heart is still singing with joy at the encounter.",,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CK4T4K9
