I do not see him interact with many people as most of our time together takes place at home or with family.  I don't often see his interactions out in the world. I am surprised by how far he has come and sometimes I don't even recognize him as he speaks to others in public. I still see him as a little boy struggling with social interactions. Even with someone who my son had not seen in years, my son was able to engage in a meaningful two-way conversation. He asked good questions, made a joke, exhibited appropriate facial expressions, and closed the conversation well. I saw that the person engaged in the conversation with my son was also surprised by his vast social improvement since the last time they engaged several years ago.  It is an amazement to see someone you are close to be able to advance so much right before your eyes, but not realize it. My son knew I was watching the interaction, but didn't seem bothered by having me there. When I mentioned it later though, he did not want to talk about it. He saw it as nothing more than a conversation, not an achievement as I did. Does he realize how far he has come? Probably not. I don't think he thinks about in the same way as I do.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CK4T4K9,
