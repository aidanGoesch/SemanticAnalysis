Before the ceremony we took the traditional pictures of a bride and groom. He cried when I walked down the aisle but they were tears of joy. I never thought I would have such an intimate moment in front of my family. I wore a designer gown that I purchased from a local boutique and my husband wore a traditional black tux. Our bridesmaids were dressed in a purple gown and the groomsman wore hints of purple with their suits. After we said out vows and kissed we had a small reception at the pavilion and got to visit with our guest. We hired a DJ who played all the music and made all the announcements. Our cake was baked fresh from a local bakery and the flowers were simple and elegant. Food was served from my aunt's restaurant and we had a small selection of wine and beer. We danced into the evening but started on our way home by nine because we were leaving in the morning for our honeymoon. We decided to take a cruise to mexico and stayed on the ship for seven days. It was a great time but the sea made me kind of nauseous. I wan't sure if we would be able to leave our room the first day but I was able to find some medicine that helps with tummy issues. I would not want to share this moment with anyone else. He has been the perfect gentleman and even carried me across the threshold of our room. It was a magical trip and I hope our marriage will remain this wonderful for eternity.,,3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIW2D2LQS
