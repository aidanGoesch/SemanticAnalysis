That day i had taken off of work early so that i could be there in time for the ceremony. As i was leaving the office and getting into my car i was excited at the prospect of seeing him walk the stage after working for four years in high school to get his diploma and looked forward to celebrating with everyone afterwards. I was taking the usual route to get to his school, though it was earlier than i was used to going but i knew the route well, when i saw a car stalled on the side of the road. At first i didnt think much of it as breakdowns and car problems werent uncommon to see on the road but then i noticed flickering light from inside the car. I moved lanes to get closer as i approached to see if there was a problem and as i moved closer i could tell that the light was caused by a fire in the car and couldn't see anyone around who looked as though they had gotten out of the car. I then immediately pulled over to see if anyone was still inside and started calling 911 in case anyone needed help or at the very least to report a potential fire hazard. By the time i had gotten out of my car i had already gotten a hold of the emergency operator and began explaining the situation. The operator told me to be careful but asked if i could see anyone in the car. I looked through the windows to see if i could see someone and though the smoke had now begun to make things difficult to see i could barely make out a driver. I immediately reported this to the operator and opened the door to get to the driver and as i did smoked sprung forth from the now open door. Luckily the fire appeared to have not spread to the front and i was able to get the driver out relatively easily and though they were unconscious they were breathing so i moved them away from the car and waited for the ambulance to arrive. By the time they arrived the car had fully caught on fire and they began immediately checking the driver and asking me questions. It took me quite a while before i was finally able to leave but despite this excitement i couldn't really do anything else to help and my sons graduation had already started so i left hoping i could still make it in time to see him cross the stage. As i arrived i heard them calling the names of the graduating students but luckily our last name started with an S and they were still in the P's so i did miss the start of the ceremony but was still able to see him cross the stage that day. I never really told him what happened that day just that i was caught in traffic and arrived a bit late but still made it in time for the important part.",,3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIWUOVLQZ
