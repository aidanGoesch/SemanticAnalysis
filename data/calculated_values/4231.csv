Will I run out of things to say? Will we run out of things to do? Small talk for 7 days? It turned out it was the best party I had ever been to. There were some really gorgeous girls there. I spent time with a different one on each of the 7 days. This party happened 6 weeks ago, and I am still glowing with its fond memories. The only problem is that all 7 girls are now calling me. Do I have to choose one? Do I even want to get married? They are all terrific. Maybe I should become a Mormon and marry all 7. What is that sound? So annoying. Oh, it's my alarm clock! Wait, so it was all a dream? Damn! I knew it was too good to be true. Oh well, being single isn't so bad.",,3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIWXRVQLD
