But it ramped up around Thursday when most of the group was there. We had a huge 40 inch pizza sitting in the living room. We had five of us sleeping in the living room on couches and in the hallway as well. We went as a group to a Dave and Buster's like arcade. I won a couple of people some anime figurines.  I watched a friend play DDR. And we just generally hung out and dicked around. It was a great night. We got back home and then as a giant group played some Jackbox. It was a helluva day overall where we all just hung out and did cool stuff. I'll look back fondly, because I don't get to hang out with people in person very often. So it was great to get out of my shell, talk to actual people and actually physically do things.  It's important for you own self to get out and do things. Even if it's just going out alone, and even better if it's with people, get out and do stuff.",3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIWXRVQLD,
