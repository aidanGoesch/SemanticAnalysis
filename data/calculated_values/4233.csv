I had reservations about going because I'm a shy person. But I knew most of these people a bit and it would be a good time learning about where I'm soon moving to!  So I hopped in my car and took the 7-8ish hour drive to the house and the adventure began. I got there as the second person, so for a  day it was just a few of us chilling. The next day more people started filing in and we went out to eat for the first time. The third day is is when things really ramped up as we ordered a huge 40 inch pizza and the bulk of the people that I connected with the most arrived. The next day we went to a pretty dope arcade as a group and the rest of the people that were coming arrived as well. We were in a packed house full with 13 people and it was crazy. People were sleeping everywhere imaginable. The next day, the 13 of us went out to eat, partook in some weed and played some video games like Jackbox and Smash Ultimate. We did so many little things like eating out as a cool kids group of us, went to a gaming bar, shopped at Wal-Mart at like midnight and just so many little fun moments I won't forget. People started leaving on Saturday, so we light off some fireworks in celebration. The last day I was there the few of us left went out to eat and then I took off to head home in the afternoon. It was a pretty dope week.",3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIWXRVQLD,3NLZY2D53QBG3XPQ94FNEHIWXRVQLD
