She was very important to me in that she was someone always there when anyone, including myself, needed help. It was a sad affair of course and I did see a lot of people that I have not seen in a long time which was nice. I wish it was bigger. But I understand that she would not have wanted a big funeral even though I think the family could afford it.   It was outside on a nice day too. Sunny but clear enough to not be too hot or too cloudy, just a nice day really. The speakers were people close to her. One of her sisters spoke, which was to me surprising as she was someone I've never met! You never get to even comprehend the people that were close to your grandparents, their parents, their siblings, their friends, and to see some of those people pop up was great. I wish I had more time to talk to them.   I almost gathered the courage to say something. I'm not sure why I did not, a few people wanted me to, but I felt like what was said was enough. I know the relationship I had with her may have seemed distant to others but I knew it was closer than that. I think what I remember the most about the funeral is that there wasn't much crying. My dad didn't cry. My Mom mentioned that too, she wanted to hold back her tears because there wasn't many being shed. It wasn't that my grandmother wasn't appreciated, it was just that people remembered her spirit and positivity and we all felt that she was just going on to the next stage of her life.",,3NPFYT4IZDQKQ2C1KRDZVX9HVSHXGN
