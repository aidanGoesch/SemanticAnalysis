There was no family with me. I had only my girl friends to join me in the city. I had a fun time at the beach. I made a big castle out of sand. The castle got poured over by a wave of salt water. My friends laughed at me. I got to see many tours of the city. I got to see a tour of some movie sets. My friends and I had a great time with the props. The food in the town was also great. I had a large pizza to share with the girls. We barely finished the pie. The people are a bit rude here but I got over it. The trip was a fun time. I realized I'm my own person and not constrained to a role in life.",,3NPI0JQDAPRJMYWGI02P0323K03TPI
