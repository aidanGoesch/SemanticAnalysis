It was a girls trip, so my husband and children were at home. This was the first time I had been on the West Coast and the first time in a long time that I had been away by myself without anyone from my family with me. The weather was amazing and I saw a lot of great things. We went on two tours, a Hollywood tour and a WB Studios Tour. It was really cool to see the back lots of WB Studios and even get to step foot on the stage of the Ellen show. I also got to see some of my favorite shows' sets and also got to see famous people's houses on the other tour. I also had some of the best food while there. We went to a restaurant that was part of LA restaurant week and I wasn't even sure what I was ordering, even with the descriptions. We went to another restaurant that wouldn't allow you to take pictures on your cellphones. That was really different, but great because it made us all focus on each other instead of technology. We also went to the beach and to an art museum. The beach was a great experience and it was the most diverse part of the city I saw. That was my first time stepping foot in the Pacific Ocean. I will never forget this trip because it reminded me that I'm still a person outside of work and family. I get lost in the daily grind and forget how to enjoy life. This trip made me so happy and I don't think I'll ever forget it.",,3NPI0JQDAPRJMYWGI02P0323K03TPI
