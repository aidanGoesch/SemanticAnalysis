I like to sing, take photograph, make pantomimes, participate in church and dramas, help others, etc. Everything I do has be great. I like using my imagination and being creative in everything i do. When my work represents my person is very well done. I am the type of of boy that every detail has to be covered, nothing more and nothing less. I usually go beyond what people expect of me. These are the things that make me feel this way.  However, when something does not go as I want, or simply does not work out well I get frustrated, anxious, and drained. There are many things I mastered as a person but when I have my comfortable zone I get frustrated and lose myself. When you do things you bad never done before it requires more effort and more of me. In the other words, is going beyond what the person expects from you. Also, is thinking deeper than usual so everything can go as I plan. Therefore, is good to get out of your comfortable zone and try new things but I understand that not everyone has the capacity for a change as drastic as this one sometimes. it has helped me to make better decisions and work more with my emotions. For situation can change, make an action plan.",,3NPI0JQDAPRJMYWGI02P0323SOLTPK
