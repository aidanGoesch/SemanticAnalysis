I was scared, nervous, and not really sure what to expect. The doctor who helped me was fantastic, she helped figure out my triggers, what exactly it was that was making me so anxious and prescribed me a new medicine to help me calm down. I had been taking it for about a week or so when I started noticing some changes in my body. I was losing weight, and fast. I expected some differences in behavior the first few weeks due to the chemical changes happening but I was not expecting weight loss. I chalked it up to the medication and figured it was a minor side effect and continued taking my medicine as prescribed. After about three weeks of taking this medicine I looked like a normal girl. All of my clothes were falling off my body, I had to go buy new clothing. I felt fantastic; 50 pounds down in 3 weeks! When I went into the doctors office again, my doctor was shocked and had a look of horror on her face. I told her that I loved how I had looked and that it is the best medication because I felt so much better. The doctor immediately told me that this was not what was supposed to happen with my medicine. She immediately told me that I would no longer be getting that prescription, that losing that much weight in such a short time span was incredibly unhealthy and she would like to run blood work to make sure I was okay. Luckily the blood work came back just fine. I was a lucky patient. After going home, new medication in hand, I looked at myself in the mirror. I am the girl I used to be. I am no longer the ""fat"" friend. I realized that my anxiety and depression was caused by my lack of self confidence. I made a goal that day to work out and keep this weight off. It has been 3 months now since the weight gain and I have reduced doses of my medication. I am doing fantastic without them! It took a major change to see that it wasn't all chemical but also self confidence issues that was causing all of my anxiety. I am so grateful for seeking help when I needed it.",,3NPI0JQDAPRJMYWGI02P0323UEWTPD
