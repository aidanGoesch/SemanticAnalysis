Well, huge emotionally, but it was actually relatively tame in terms of an argument. I snooped through his messages again, which was totally my  fault and I know that was wrong, but I knew something was up and I was paranoid from all the times he cheated on me. Anyways, turns out he's talking to Liz again so I wasn't completely crazy. According to his messages he loves her, he's loved her this whole time he's been with me, which feels super not great. The sad thing is that he wouldn't even admit it to me, I tried to get him to confess the truth on his own a few times, and he always just denied it. What a pathetic liar. Of course I finally told him I knew the truth and then that was a whole thing. But it's okay. Whatever. I'm so done putting time into that boy when he couldn't even be bothered to get his act long enough to hold down a job. I know I deserve better. There is no excuse to cheating and he is just a cowardly child who is too afraid of being alone and having to grow up to ever be a person worth anything. He wanted us to be friends still. Can you imagine? No thanks. If he doesn't have enough basic respect for me not to lie to me, then I don't want him in my life at all.",,3NQL1CS15SUS84S6EIYNECJ0SAZYVL
