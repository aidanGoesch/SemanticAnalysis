Last week when I was on vacation in Indonesia, Jessie convinced me to smoke with him. I told him no because I don't do drugs. Also, I don't even know where he got the marijuana from. Anyways.. he eventually convinced me to try  it.  Honestly, it was the worst experience ever.  I tried to sleep it off but I was wide awake. I eventually decided to go on a jog to a nearby shop for snacks... BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER! I wasn't even halfway there when this creep in front of a rundown motel grabs my arm mid-jog. He kept pointing at a room window where there were a couple girls in the window that looked to be about thirteen or fourteen years. I was so disgusted. I yanked my arm away and ran all the way back to the hotel. I locked the hotel door and stayed locked in the room until the vacation was over. I won't be coming back here anytime soon. Thinking back I probably should've called the cops on that creep. Anyways... remember to say no to drugs! This was my first and only encounter with drugs.",,3NQL1CS15SUS84S6EIYNECJ0V32VYA
