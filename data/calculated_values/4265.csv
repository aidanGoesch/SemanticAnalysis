It was out of town and took me about 4 hours to drive there. It was nice catching up with lots of old friends I saw there. There were lots of people I didn't expect to be there. It was a nice surprise. I had a lot of fun catching up with everyone there. I didn't want to go at first because it was kind of far away. Also I was moving that weekend. I decided to go after my friend, the groom, asked me over and over again on the phone. I'm glad I ended up going. I probably wouldn't have he didn't call me up personally to try and persuade me to come. It was a decently lengthy road trip and I'm glad the weather was nice. I planned to go and come back the same day but that didn't end up happening. I decided to spend the night out of town. I ended up having more fun than I planned. It was a great trip overall.",3NS0A6KXC5U9VXCGL91KSIPS35CGZQ,
