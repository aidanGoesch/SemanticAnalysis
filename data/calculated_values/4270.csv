I also hate to be the cause of conflict. So here I am, at work, feeling queasy from morning sickness (I’m 8 weeks)And I get a message from DH’s Aunt. She asks me if I had anything planned for my birthday which is in about 3 weeks. I figure she’s just organising her families calendar, so I say “nothing as of yet, when I do it might just be low key pizzas at our house” (We are actually organising something so we can announce we are pregnant to his family!)And she writes a spiel about her MLM (I forgot she was involved in) and how she can host a party for me and my friends and it will be loads of fun and we will get loads of freebies and blah blah blah. And I instantly get a cold sweat, I wonder how I can explain to her that I’m fundamentally against supporting MLMs without pissing her off, if it’s less hassle to just let her throw one, while also being irritated that she would even ask.  Every invite I’ve received from her so far on FB, I’ve just ignored, hoping she wouldn’t notice me among all the other women she invited. Then the hormone monster took over for a second, and I  wrote “No, thank you” and hit send. And she wrote back “Oh, OK” And that’s it!  And now I’m sitting here with a stupid grin on my face because I feel relieved that I didn’t do what I normally would do which is stew over it for days, trying to figure out how to tiptoe around the issue, or bean dip, meanwhile stressing myself out.                                                                                                                                                                                 My original instinct was not to “go on a rant”, it was the feeling of needing to justify my response, and the stress of trying to figure out how to justify my lack of wanting to be involved, without hurting any feelings. I did not say that MLM people are crazy monsters.  I do think the MLM business model is unethical and I hate having friends and family trying to sell me things.  But that wasn’t my point of posting. My point was that I was trying to come up with a good excuse or response and was feeling stressed about it, when all I needed to say was “no”.  I’m very bad at doing that, and it felt good to do so.  I did the same thing throughout my wedding, so I thought I’d share as a reminder that it’s okay to say no.",,3NS0A6KXC5U9VXCGL91KSIPSCVPGZS
