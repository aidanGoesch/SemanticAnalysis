About four weeks ago our son was born! It has been a whirlwind welcoming him into our home! We had prepared for nine months and now here he is! It has been quite an adjustment for everyone. If that wasn't enough, our five year old daughter starts school. Dealing with her anxiety has been rough. She has had some pretty big changes come her way. Welcoming a new little brother and not being at home, but rather in school. Honestly, I am still trying to find a routine. I know the sooner I find my balance and have a solid routine in place, the easier it will be for her. She craves the security of everything being normal, even if it is a new normal for all of us. When things change, even good things, there is a period of real adjustment that needs to take place. once we get that together I anticipate things will be much more comfortable for everyone. She will calm down and the baby, will hopefully start sleeping through the night. The grown ups? We would just like to have a cup of coffee and a shower in a reasonable time frame.",,3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRH10S3YZ
