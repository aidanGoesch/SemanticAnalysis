It was our first boy! We were very happy to have a boy. We have one girl already and she is five. Adding a second child to our lives has been strange to me. Its just so different to have another child in the house. I will catch myself being surprised of that quite often. We are very happy to have him in the house. Our daughter has been very helpful with the baby. She is very excited to have a baby brother! She will help changing the baby and throwing his diapers away. She wants to show him his toys, but he is not ready for them yet. She does not quite understand why just yet. She will be starting kindergarden soon. Having this happen all at once the baby and her school has been tough. Hopefully soon everything will fall in to place. This even has been very emotional in several ways. The new baby and our daughter going to school. As a family we are strong and will get through the coming days.",3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRH10S3YZ,3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRH10S3YZ
