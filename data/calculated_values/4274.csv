It was five months ago on a Saturday. My brother and I were sitting on the back deck enjoying a beer in the evening. The sun was setting, it was still and warm. We hear a ""beep"" like a car locking itself. We weren't expecting company but friends sometimes show up. Around the corner to the fence gate appeared our dad. He has became more open and sentimental since the passing of our mom a year and a half ago. He used to be a rugged, rough around the edges type a guy. After our Mothers' passing he started to cherish relationships more. He approached us with a gentle smile and said, ""hiya boys, mind if I join ya?"". We figured he was lonely and just wanted to hang out with his kids, we loved that he came by. After a beer or two and just chillin' he looked up at us and stated he needed to tell us something. He continued on to tell us he was remarrying in a few days. My brother and I were shocked, but we were aware he was seeing someone. We had been happy for him. He was nervous, telling us. Nervous we would hold contempt for him or anger. Quite the opposite, we were overjoyed. We had to compartmentalize as we were still mourning the loss of our mother, but it wouldn't be fair to not allow him to move on. He broke out in tears. We had never seen our dad cry, it caught us off-guard. He thanked us, profusely, for being okay with it. We told him we loved him and that mom would be happy he had found someone. We got pretty buzzed that night, the three of us. It was one of the best bonding experiences we've had and we owe it all to mom",,3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRHDFPY3X
