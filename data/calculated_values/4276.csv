We both understand that we were put here for a significant reason. Despite all that is happening around us. Our love for each other insulates us from the ruthlessness of this world. Each and everyday we are going to war. War with mindsets. War with behaviors. War with ourselves sometimes. We often ask our selves why would God put us in such a warzone like this. Then I look to social media and realize that he never intended for it to be this way. This is what happens when you involve choices. In order for choice to be free you need to present the choice to disobey.  This is life. We must fight through it.",,3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRHWEM3YG
