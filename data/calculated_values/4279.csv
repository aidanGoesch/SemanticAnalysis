We met through socializing with our mutual friends. One of those friends, Judy, was very close to both of us. I had known Judy for two years from working with her in the company I still work for. My fiance, Betty, has known Judy since high school and until recently they were very close friends. A couple months ago we were all at a party thrown by a friend. Everybody had been drinking and socializing for an hour or so. All of sudden I heard Judy screaming at Betty. She called her a ""bitch"", and said she never wanted anything to do with her again. I was shocked, and walked over to them to see if I could calm things down. Judy looked at me and said, "" And you...you are the cause of all of this!"" Judy then stomped out of the party and we have not spoken since. I asked my fiance what this was all about, and she just shrugged and said she was shocked and did not know what the problem was. I have tried unsuccessfully to figure it all out. The best I can figure is that Judy had had a crush on me and felt that Betty had taken advantage of me. It seems crazy to end friendships over some silly jealousy, but that is the best explanation I can come up with. I am sad that it happened, but I feel like Betty and I are definitely not at fault. I can only hope that our relationships to Judy improve again over time.",,3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA60IR79Y
