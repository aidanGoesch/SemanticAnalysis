The fact that they called us and told us they were going to come over here in Florida really surprised me. I was excited about the fact that we were going to have a lot of activities planned here and it was during the summer as well. So they show up at our place on a Friday yesterday. We all greeted them and gave them a gave them a big hug. We let them get adjusted to arriving here in Florida due to them living in Texas. We spent the day eating dinner and reconciling in the living room. We felt like a genuine family and we bid them goodnight since we were going to the beach tomorrow. We went to the store early and bought everything needed to go. We went around 1pm since we wanted to get a good spot and avoid the crowds that were going to show up later. We then spent the whole afternoon playing football,swimming,sunbathing,and snorkeling there. We were quite sunburnt and we needed to wash off the sand off our feet and body so we were left around 7pm. We all took a shower since I wanted to invite them out on a seafood dinner. We went to this nice restaurant by a beach and the scenery was amazing. We were amazed by the food and the service that was provided and it was a bit expensive but it was so worth the price. We had a lot of fun with them here!",,3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6P4M97S
