It was really early in the morning, maybe 6:30am. I stopped at a gas station I don't normally go to to pick up an energy drink before I went to work. Out the corner of my eye I saw someone vaguely familiar but just kind of dismissed it. As I rounded the aisles I saw him again, but a bit clearer. I was almost sure it was a friend I hadn't seen in over a decade. The last time we saw each other was in my hometown, and we hadn't spoken in many years. As I got a bit closer I could see it was him, so I called out his name. He looked up and immediately recognized me. Straight away he walked towards me for a hug and asked how I was. It was so weird - he'd moved here a few years before and me only a few weeks before, and he worked nights. Normally he was still at work at this time, so it was even stranger for us to bump into each other. We briefly caught up and then went our separate ways. We promised to  to meet up and hang out in the near future. It still kind of blows my mind that it even happened - I don't believe in fate, but things like that make me question it a little.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6PZ4970,
