Any chance they get, they'll skirt out on some adventurous trip to enjoy the outdoors. Both of them love being active and very much enjoy nature. I've always being an outdoorsy person, too. As a young child, I played many sports and you could always find me playing outside! I had a tetherball set up in my backyard, lots of roller skates, bikes and scooters. I loved going hiking, taking my sister to the park, taking our dog for a walk and so many other activities that involved enjoying the outdoors. My love for the outdoors continued passed my childhood. Once I had my daughter, a lot of her activities took place outside the house. I definitely think I passed on the love for the outdoors to my daughter. About six weeks ago, my daughter and her husband took a road trip out to Texas. They decided to forgo Thanksgiving plans and instead go camping. They had told me of their plans and I was super excited for them. I wanted to join but I had already committed to a Thanksgiving dinner party. On Thanksgiving day, I get a frantic call from my daughter. She tells me she is bleeding quite a bit and she had missed her period for a few months. I told her to try to relax and suggested she call her doctor. She cut the camping trip short and returned home promptly. The bleeding continued but it had subsided a lot. She had an appointment a couple of days after Thanksgiving and a blood test revealed she was pregnant. She returned to the doctor a couple of weeks later and to our surprise, the ultrasound showed not one but two kids!",,32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZAUTBVK
