He had always talked while I was growing up about how he wishes he had a closer connection with his Mum's family. He wanted to see the places he had heard stories about, and see his grandparents home, where his mom grew up. I decided it was now, or never to see this through. I talked to my dad a few weeks back and made sure he was OK with the travel arrangements.  He tried to persuade me not use my time-off from work on this trip. He said, ""Oh, I'm too old to fool with a holiday to Ireland! I can look at pictures of the place anytime I want. Seriously, go spend your time away from work at the beach with your family. Don't worry about me. I'm just an old man."" But I knew what I had to do. I told him, ""Dad, I appreciate that but this is important to me, and I know it's important to you as well. Please plan on having a small bag packed on the first Saturday in August, and I'll pick you up in the morning for a two night stay in Ireland!"" And we did! We enjoyed a nice drive along the highway and didn't hit any traffic at all. We were in Ireland within 3-4 hours. The first place we stopped was at a diner for breakfast and coffee. We made chit chat with the server and found out about the area we were in. She helped us find our way on the road to do a pass-by his grandparent's old home. It looked just like pictures we had back at home. We made our way to his mum's house and she had a lunch and tea ready for us. We spent the whole day looking at old photo books, and telling stories of the old times. I was personally so glad to get to join my dad on this trip and I know it also meant quite a bit to him as well!",,3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6YND97U
