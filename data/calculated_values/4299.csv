I had my shower. Today the breakfast was very delicious. It was my favorite sandwich. After getting ready I took my bike and went outside. I had to go for some errands. On the way, I heard a strange sound. I was shocked when I saw some people standing near by the local gas station. I innocently went there to see the actual situation. I got surprised when I saw a person standing there and making arguments with the people around him and suddenly he maced several people. The situation got me out of my control and I called the police. The cops came and took the situation under their control and went with the person.  The man's behavior surprised me a lot. This was a shocking and also surprising event that happened today. With Love,XXXX",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q4OLEIY
