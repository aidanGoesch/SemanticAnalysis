Today I got my 60 day chip for being sober. I feel pretty good about the fact that I was able to get back on the wagon, but I'm also pretty disappointed in the fact that I fell off to begin with. I'd say that's 8 years wasted, down the drain, but my support group says that I need to consider that addiction is an illness that never actually subsides. It will always be there with you, so it's important to be weary of triggers for relapse, but I was still an addict for those 8 years so it's not that I've failed. As you know, a year ago, my mother passed away. After she passed, her house was seized by the bank and that's where I had been living while I try to get my life in order. Karen came to the funeral and when I told her about my issues, she said she had just the thing to pick me up. I shouldn't have been hanging out with her to begin with, but with the passing of my mom, it seemed like she just wanted to reminisce about the good old days and I was really feeling the nostalgia. So, I went to the party with her and in my desperation, started drinking while we were there. It was a wild night, and I really wasn't in a good head space. I ended up passing out on the uber ride home and she had to practically carry me to my bathroom. We tipped the uber pretty well. I woke up on the bathroom floor and immediately regretted my night, but thought.. 'to hell with it' and went to the liquor store right away and stocked up. I drank for about 3 days straight thinking I'd be able to get back on the wagon myself, but those few days of acceptance led to months of acceptance and I found myself at work trying to hide my vodka in a water bottle. When my brother came to visit, he noticed all of the empty bottle in the trash and convinced me to take a week off and go to a rehab facility. I agreed and my time there was nice, they really helped me understand my triggers and forgive myself while taking responsibility for my actions. Since my release, I've been going to AA meetings and tonight I got my 60 day chip. I'm confident in my progress but I am still a little ashamed of the fact that I fell so far off the wagon after 8 years. I'm hoping things will get better with my new job and apartment.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5PHEIX
