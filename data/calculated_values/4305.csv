I thought I'd had experiences with losing sleep before, but nothing has ever compared to this. Even being healthy, early birth aside, I couldn't help but feel something could and would go wrong at any moment. I was constantly on edge, thinking some nurse would come in to tell me he'd taken a turn for the worse. All of this and overall environment made it impossible to get anything resembling a solid night's sleep. I'm sure I got some, since I wouldn't be alive right now to write this if I hadn't. But, it felt like I may as well have awake the whole three weeks. I also got very accustomed to the taste of hospital food and the beeping of machines. That could maybe be considered a life skill in future situations I hope I'm never in again. I was lucky to have my family around for support, at least. Although I'm sure I acted more than a little nuts to them, they managed to put up with me regardless. I don't know if I've ever had a moment of pure relief more powerful when the doctors told me he was ready to come home, and was doing fine. I was grateful that me and my partner's family offered to stay over for a while, since I don't think I would've gotten much more sleep at home the first few nights without them. When I finally got in my own bed, I slept like a brick. Waking up knowing my son was safe and healthy had to be the best feeling I've ever had.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5QJEI1
