During that time, I've applied and interviewed to more than few dozens companies. Finally, this week I received a great news, a job offer as a web producer close to where I live. This is a really an exciting news, upon receiving the news I get to celebrate with my family and went to our favorite restaurant. While, the job responsibility is simple and straight forward, I know it will be quite challenging. Knowing that I haven't been working in an office setting for more than 5 years is very nerve wrecking. I've been away from the work force to  focus on my family and raising my children. So, the thought of taking care of the family, attending to the children, and the demand of the job maybe too overwhelming at the moment. On top of that I have to learn new software and technology in less than a month. I'm confident with my experience and skill set I can adjust quickly. But imagining how crazy my daily schedule can be, seems quite challenging. Nevertheless I am very grateful this job offers opportunity to work from home, a really good starting salary, and close from home. So, I don't have to commute and deal with traffic on daily basis. Moreover, I can still focus on my family as well earning additional income. Finally, I no longer unemployed and once again become a positive contributor to the society.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QEJJEIW
