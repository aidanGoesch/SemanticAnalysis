The weather didn't shift much, and as we trotted around the city we'd slip and regather ourselves perpetually. It was icy cold but the hospitable warmth made up for it. We managed to visit many great breweries and drinking holes and enjoyed the time spent staying up late and barhopping. We had a great meal and one of the local restaurants, food to make one weep really. We spent our days taking in as much of the sites as we could. The harbor, catching the sights and sounds of the waves, the cultural diversity in the area, swinging and changing as we walked. Areas changed in the night time and looked so different. We managed to sleep in and enjoy the warmth of the bed only to head outside to grab fresh baked goods and coffee. We did some tours of a nearby museum housing cryptids. The recreation of many scary and formidable beasts we've managed to spot, including Bigfoot. As we prepared to leave we were gutted to have to end our vacation. We agreed to go back as we enjoyed a final plate of fries smothered in gravy. We went for a last stop at a brewery and were lucky enough to win a prize. We got some free beers and we felt very appreciated. We sparked conversations and loved every moment of that special trip walking through the wintry wonderland of Portland, Maine.",3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QUPQEIV,
