Made driving up there tricky. We live on the East Coast so we're used to it. Arriving was a rush because of reservations we had. We planned to have a great big meal. We got some drinks, and uber'd to our destination. The food was awesome. And we unexpectedly got several free Amuse-bouche which was really so surprising. It made every extra awesome. I guess it made us feel like we were in the right place, they wanted us there. We spent our evening drinking at a local dive bar, which also got us a round of free drinks, not sure why, but no complaints! It was really outstanding. The next couple days was going to oddity museums, trying new restaurants, visiting breweries. We went on a few walks around the city too. Taking in all the sights and sound. Really kinda great to be able to explore a place that's both familiar and unfamiliar at the same time. It was an awesome trip, can't wait to go back.",3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QUPQEIV,
