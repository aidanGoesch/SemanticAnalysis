I was raised by my mother and her parents.  They were devout Southern Baptists, and I was raised to be the same.  As I got older my views about the origins of the world and humanity changed quite a bit.  I grew to believe in the things I was being taught in my science and history classes rather than the religious stories that my family repeated over and over.  None of this changed my love for my family and I never felt the need to let them know that my views about religion had changed.  Not only would they be hurt, they would be down right frightened for my everlasting soul.  It would be a real big deal, and since it doesn't harm me in any way to pretend that I still agree with their religious beliefs, I just let it go.  They're not going to change their minds, and I'm not going to change mine.  This is a situation where ignorance really is bliss for all parties involved.  I even still go to church with my family when I'm home.  I enjoy catching up with people I've known since childhood.  The social gathering remind me of growing up, and even if I don't believe I can still enjoy a great church potluck. So six months ago I was home for a couple of weeks and I went to one of those lunches with my family and I was introduced to Sue.  Sue and I hit it off in a big way.  We spoke for hours that day and ended up having coffee and then dinner together before I left town.  We text each other daily and talk on the phone often, and I've made a couple of trips back home just to spend more time with her.  That chance meeting has evolved into a relationship, but, even though Sue and I have similar backgrounds, we don't share the same beliefs.  Unlike me, Sue does believe in God and she's every bit as involved with her religion as my family is.  I haven't told Sue that I don't share her Christian beliefs.  I think that's going to be a deal breaker for her and I'm just not sure what to do at this point.  Maybe there would have been a chance for us if I had been honest from the beginning.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QXK0EIY
