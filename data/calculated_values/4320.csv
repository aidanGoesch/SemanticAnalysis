Her mother, my sister, passed away very shortly after, when her daughter was still just an infant. My sister's ex-husband and never planned on being a father figure in his daughter's life, and when doing so meant being a single parent, he ran for the hills. I took my niece in and raised her myself, as a single ""parent"". I moved around a lot to make sure she always got to go to good schools, got a good education, and was able to get into a good college - on her own merits, god knows I couldn't afford to help her pay for it. Suddenly she was a 22-year-old freshly minted college graduate, asking me to walk her down the aisle at her wedding! I write this now the day after the wedding - we partied late into the night at the reception. All I can feel is a flood of varied and overwhelming emotions, ranging from sadness and loss to pride and joy. I may be losing the closest thing I had to a daughter, and suddenly I'm an empty-nester without having ever been married. On the other hand, now I have a new ""son"", a nephew, and a whole new family to be part of. Her new husband is a great guy, and in fact he graduated with a law degree - and asked me about a job in the legal team at my company. I think I have to say yes, he's a brilliant attorney, plus he's putting food on my niece's table. Who knows, maybe a few decades from now he'll be running the company, putting food on my grand-niece's table. Maybe I'll bug my niece and tell her the tables have turned. Maybe I'll move in with her and let her take care of me! So many possibilities spring from those two little words - ""I do.""",,3OB0CAO74IBNQ3XM9THJZBSRCPUYHH
