My father passed as his health had been failing him for a hard time.  I moved here to help my family only to find out that they were still scam-artists.  No good deed goes unpunished, right?  My father had been in and out of the hospital with several issues including shoulder replacement and heart valve issues.  So, it was really no surprise when he died.  My mom couldn't get a handle on herself.  She was enraged and immature all the time...with bouts of anger that she didn't even fully understand.  Hormones may have been a part of it, but the bottom line is that she is extremely mentally ill and desperately in need of intense therapy.  Due to this, administrating the estate fell on me.  It was the most difficult thing I've ever done (especially with her madness going around).  We thought that the estate was insolvent which made everything doubly stressful.  In any case, it finally closed months ago.  Wouldn't you know it...my mom never even thanked me for carrying her through that time.  I was even able to pull through and find a way to pull some money out of the estate...which was surprising.  Regardless, she just took all the credit and moved on.  What a joke.  We did go out and celebrate as I was able to look past that as I know how sick she is.  Another thing is that, despite my hard work, she tried to steal my inheritance.  It didn't fly entirely but she was able to get half of it.  The joke will be on her as I won't be around if she ever needs my help again...",3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1ACXLXKZ,
