It was a horrible day that I will never forget. I still have nightmares about it to this day. Two months ago I was in my room playing video games. It was a typical day and I was home along in my house. My dad would be coming home any minute now. We had recently gotten a new dog and my old dog and her go along just fine or that what we originally thought. However, on that day I heard growling and then a loud yelping noise. I pause my game and run down the stairs as fast as possible. My dogs got into a huge fight and one had the other one by the neck and was trying to kill her. I rushed over there and pulled them apart the best I could. The small dog had puncture wounds all over and had heavy bleeding. Thankfully my dad walked right in the door and took control of it. I knew how to solve the issue but was not ready to take control. He sprung into action telling me the things he would need to help my dog. I grabbed all of the supplies for him and he started washing and stitching my dog up. I was very lucky that he is a veterinarian and that he was able to save my dog. Now we keep both dogs separate but I will never forget that fateful day.",,3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1AMUKXK2
