You may make a difference for the company with what you do, but in my case, day in and day out, I was involved in the most meaningless tasks and unappealing jobs ever. Donâ€™t get me wrong. I was making $140,000 for writing simple code and playing ping-pong with the other Google engineers. Free lunches and subsidized transportation was also lovely. But at the end of the day, I was not fulfilled. Every morning I woke up unhappy because I was working with my brain instead of my heart. I was excellent about what I was doing, but I had no passion for it. I realized that I needed to pivot and turn my passion into my career.  It was not an easy decision because everyone I talked to thought it was not a good idea. But I did it anyway. I turned in my resignation letter one month ago and moved to Colorado and have made snowboarding my new life. I have been hired as a backcountry tour guide. I know my Google colleagues would be laughing with my current salary. I will get $30,000 a year plus incentives, almost five times less than what I was making at Google. And I love every minute of it.",,3OF2M9AATHAEXJ8ZB0MZQAHLKXMZK1
