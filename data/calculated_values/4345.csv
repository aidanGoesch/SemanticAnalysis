Groggy as can be I stumbled down the steps to see what was going on. Three policemen were at my door. Confused, I opened the door and their barreled themselves in. They quickly grabbed my arms and threw me to the floor. I was asking them what was happened and they said they believe drugs are being made here. Shocked, I told them there wasn't. However, they didn't take my word for it. Then, my kids started to wake up and started to cry when they saw the policeman and my situation. I tried my best to calm them down, but it didn't work. After they left not finding anything, they apologized and said maybe they had the wrong house. Well, they forgot to tell child protective services this because they came over in the morning asking questions about what the police originally said. Then, they started asking my kids if they saw me do anything out of the ordinary. If many people were over, things like that. I was so upset and angry. It was a hard 3 months proving to them I did nothing wrong. Police needs to get their facts straight. I feel scarred for life!",,3OF2M9AATHAEXJ8ZB0MZQAHLLZ6ZKQ
