I have a thorough enjoyment of the bluegrass genre of music.  I even go online to catch videos of my favorite artists that performed at the festival I attended. That is how excellent the musicians were. Even revisiting some of the artists through a sometimes less than stellar audio and video, ie: uploaded amateur recordings, is still worth another listen! Any time I have the opportunity I look for other venues in my area that offer the genre. I am blessed to live in an area where the opportunities are abundant. What has really been exciting is finding out that many of the artists I admired for their talents are often performing in areas of the country close enough that I can both financially and physically attend some of the venues. I have continued learning guitar. I practice regularly.  I have discovered that playing is very therapeutic and a definite way to relax. I find an inner peace no matter what kind of day I have had. I have yet to find an opportunity to plan a musical vacation with my granddaughter. She is a busy young lady, college is on the horizon. But we now have another special reason to stay connected. We can talk about what we are learning and techniques we use to improve and progress in our abilities as 'guitarist's'.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LL6WAO6,
