She was fine at the treatment center, but once we got home she became violently ill.  She retched for hours and hours.  I felt helpless.  All of the information that they gave us did not prepare us for this.  She was shaking and feverish and could not stop throwing up, even when there was nothing left to expel.  When helped her into bed I noticed that her was seemed higher, she was awfully pale, and her breathing became shallow and labored.  When I tried to wake her, she didn't respond.  That is when I called the ambulance. As the ambulance was wheeling my beloved wife out of the house, my dog started howling.  He must have known something was wrong and was reacting to the palpable emotions around him.  I put him on his leash so that he wouldn't run out the door, and I led him outside.  He continued to howl, even with my comforting pats.  As I approached the ambulance behind my wife, a paramedic told me that my dog couldn't come in the ambulance.  It was then that my new neighbor stepped over to us.  I hadn't met her yet, but I had seen her taking out the trash and playing with her kids on the front lawn, and she was always friendly.  She bent down and began soothing my dog and told me not to worry about the pup.  She would watch him for as long as we needed.  She told me to focus on my wife.  The dog would be fine.  Her children who were several feet behind her also volunteered to help.  I almost cried in relief and gratitude.  I couldn't believe my new neighbor was so kind and selfless.  I thanked her and handed her the leash.  She looked at me with sympathy and told me not to worry about a thing.",,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LUUNAOI
