The cancer was in an area that could not be operated on so her only options were chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Since she already suffers from Fibromyalgia we knew it was going to be very hard on her. On the first day of radiation the doctor decided to wait a few days to start the chemo treatment as both in one day would be too much for her. When the day came we went to the infusion center and she was hooked up for about 4 hours but had to take a chemo bag with her that pumped the chemicals into her body 24 hours per day. She started on a Monday and by Wednesday she was so sick she couldn't get out of bed. As the day progressed she started getting confused and couldn't even finish a sentence. I decided she had to go to the hospital and I thought I could help her out of bed and downstairs and into the car but I found that she was in so much pain I couldn't touch her anywhere without her screaming. I called 911 for an ambulance and while waiting for them her condition worsened. They arrived in about 10 minutes and I tried to move as many things out of the way as I could so they could get the gurney down our two half flights of stairs. There were 4 of them and it took all of us to get her on the gurney, because she was screaming in pain and delirious. I was trying to stay calm but this all happened so suddenly I completely forgot about our little girl. I had block her off in the den while the paramedics were there as that was the first thing they requested so no animals would be in the way or get hurt. Once they had her in the ambulance they asked where I wanted her to be taken and if I needed to ride in the front of the ambulance. There said insurance restrictions prevented me from riding in the back with her. I said I would follow them in my car, not knowing how long I would be there. As they drove away I thought of all the things I had to do while at the same time thinking and worrying about my wife. A neighbor who I did not know and who lives 2 doors away was standing outside watching. For a brief second I was a bit annoyed at them watching a ""show"" and I was becoming a bir frantic trying to figure out everything I had to do even before getting in my car and driving to the hospital so I could be with my sweetheart. I heard this soft voice saying ""sir"", ""sir"" and I turned around to see this neighbor trying to get my attention. I thought she might want to know what was going on but she softly said ""if there's anything I can do for you let me know"". I asked her if there was any way she could watch our 4 month old puppy and she said she would be glad to. I quickly brought her kennel and food over, locked the house and drove to the hospital, calling everyone that needed to be told , on the way. It was a day I'll never forget but we got through it and my wife is on her way to being cancer free, for the second time.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LUUNAOI,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LUUNAOI
