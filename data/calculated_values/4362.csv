I remember when the young man was born. i also knew his parents for many years now. He has a unique success story and an amazing immigrant story as well. His parents came from Mexico. They somehow managed to store their son in the luggage area of the cargo in order to get him to come to the states. His parents owned a store that did well in Mexico but the gangs there were robbing them and making their lives miserable. The son managed to come over to America and stay with family in Texas. After awhile the parents came over and started their business in Texas too. That is when I met them as they hired me to work in their store. When they told me their story I was in awe of what they did for their son. It was really brave of the boy not to get caught in the cargo area. The boy was only 9 at the time of his travels to america. I have helped their family out for many years and got to know them very well. The death of the boys father has been very hard on us all.,,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LWKUAO7
