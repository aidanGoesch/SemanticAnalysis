My husband and I planned everything until the last detail. We had our marriage on Catalina Island in the city of Avalon Ca. My family and his family flew to be with us in this special day that we will remember forever. The last 3 moths were the best of my married life so far. I still fell the emotions that i had in the day of the marriage like it was yesterday. We were so stressed the day before and worried so much that we forgot different things but it was only normal to be stressed just hours before. Every detail was planned ahead we had our wedding on the beach with a nice decor that was made by our wedding assistant. She took care of everything, from the flowers till the last chair and ornament. The day before my wedding it was pouring so bad that i thought we won't have our wedding the next day. Rain was forecast in our wedding day and it rained until the start of our ceremony. I wanted something on the smaller side and i invited only family and a few friends. I didn't want nothing fancy but something special that i can remember and enjoy forever. When we got to our vows part we were hit by light of sun and the weather turned right for our special moment. We celebrated after with our friend and family we will cherish the moment forever.",,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y73GYFAE
