It wasn't just a simple injury either. This thing came out of nowhere and literally wiped me out. It happened shortly after a gym session which didnt seem like anything different. I did work a bit harder than usual that night but thats what I do to gain strength and improve my fitness levels. Later that night after feeling an odd feeling in my leg, I felt a crazy pop. It felt relived but then shortly afterwards, I couldnt walk. This was my righ leg and I was barely even able to press the gas pedal in my car to make it home. Pains and muscle spasms begin shooting throughout my entire leg but seemed to focus near the inner part of my knee. After making it home, I immediately began RICE. The next few days were literally hell! I couldnt shower, cook food, and could barely make it to use the bathroom. I lived in a basement apt as well at this time and definitely could not make it upstairs to leave. Not that I could drive anyway. Eventually I retrieved a set of crutches that made life so much better! However, I couldn't walk work nearly an entire month and am currently still recovering. Its been about 5 months since the incident. The worst part of it all is that I am a very active and healthy young male. I put a lot of focus on health and well being and understand human anatomy and physiology at a high level. So, without the use of a major limb really puts me in a strange situation. It has been an interesting experience as far as learning how to do things that I can't do anymore but I cant say that Ive been depressed or sad. I have definitely felt worried at times though.  I hope this eventually heals and I regain full mobility of my leg.",3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1
