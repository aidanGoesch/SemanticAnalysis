This could flare up at any point. So naturally, when I took her in for a dentist appointment, I was nervous. I didn't want the dentist to accidentally lacerate something. This all took place about a week ago. I also didn't want my daughter to be traumatized by the experience. I trust the dentist fully, but I don't trust the syncope. It's never known when she'll have an episode next. It just took some time to fully grasp what I was dealing with. As she was getting dental work, she also needed nitrous oxide. I had no idea if this would exacerbate or it or numb it. Fortunately, no episode took place. But judging by the sweat on my forehead, there was. I just don't want my daughter to ever be in pain. That would tear me up.",,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6
