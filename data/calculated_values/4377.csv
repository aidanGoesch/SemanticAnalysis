Recently my daughter broke a spot between her teeth. It needs to be fixed before it decays as this is her front teeth. The problem is that she has a fainting disorder, syncope, or at least that is what we think it is, but even the Dr. doesn't know.  I am the only parent my daughter has as her father was killed in a car accident. I am the only one who helps her through these types of trials. Recently she fainted when she was with her boyfriend. He'd never seen her do it before and it was frightening for all involved. I had to explain to him, about her heart failure when she received her MMR and her pacemaker and how it malfunctioned and had to be turned off. She is 17. He still loves her but now she's terrified. It happened to her again when she tried to have a dentist fill this same tooth, only worse. She passed out came to and passed out over and over, while her eyes shook and her mouth foamed. The ER could find no reason for it. Now I have to take her to a new dentist to get it fixed. My daughter does not want to be dependent at her age, but she has to depend on me, as I have to be with her when medical procedures are performed on her. She will try nitrous oxide this time, for her dental work and we're praying it works to help her remain calm and conscious for her dental work on Friday. Parents are important especially mothers. I feel needed and have to walk a fine line between giving her freedom to live her own life while staying there for her when she desperately needs physical and emotional support.",3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6
