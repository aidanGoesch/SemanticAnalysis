My son (Jason) and Sarah, with their two little girls, live in an adjacent state, about a 5 hour drive. They scheduled a weekend visit to our home, which just happened to fall on Sarah's birthday. It wasn't a ""significant"" birthday, number wise, but I decided it would be fun to make an actual family party out of it. I figured mostly our two grand-daughters would find that entertaining. So, something I haven't done before, I bought birthday decorations (including a Happy Birthday banner, streamers, and hanging paper globes). I'm not an avid cook (but I do just fine when I need to) but I made a very special birthday dinner, complete with fancy drinks and apps. And, I bought a very elegant birthday cake from a local bakery, complete with candles to blow out. I also used a special tablecloth and had birthday plates and cups for our dessert. I told Ryan to take the family on a walk around the neighborhood so my husband and I could decorate. When they came home 1/2 hour later, Sarah (and the 2 girls) were very surprised and excited to see the decorations. Sarah even got a little teary-eyed and said she couldn't remember the last time she had a ""traditional"" birthday party. Everyone loved the food and commented how exceptional it was. The cake (and ice cream) dessert was also a huge hit. However, the best consequence was the laughter and fun and intimate conversation  that ensued between all of us and lasted well into the late evening. Although I have always had a good relationship with my daughter-in-law, I think she was really touched that I would go to so much work to do a really fun, kid-type birthday party for her. It was another step in bonding and growing friendship. Or, as my sister said, I ""got lots of points"" for this serendipitous plan!",3OLQQLKKNTBLB4BLXS8A4LGQI62JEE,3OLQQLKKNTBLB4BLXS8A4LGQI62JEE
