The 6 of us made a pact to take a cruise to commemorate the 10th anniversary of a cruise we took in school, and it did not disappoint. We decided on the Carribbean as a destination, and embarked on our journey, which provided several blasts from the past, and maybe even some glimpses at the future. Some of these guys I hadn't seen since school, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that many had gone on to exactly the kind of success we saw for each other. Some had become captains of industry. Others founded families. Some had seen unfathomable heartache. Some had achieved happiness beyond their wildest dreams. We reveled in each other's stories as we sailed into the tropics. The sights were incomparable, as was the company. There was a bittersweetness, as the passing of time was made ever apparent by the lines in our faces, yet it felt as though we'd never left one another. The memories came flooding back. Tears mixed with laughter which melted into tears again. We ate, drank and danced the days away until they became just too short. It's a journey I hope to make again whether it's 5, 10 or 20 years from now.",,3OLQQLKKNTBLB4BLXS8A4LGQRYCJEH
