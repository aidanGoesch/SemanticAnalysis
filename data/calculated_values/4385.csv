I had a brand new Dell computer and the hard drive went flaky. I have heard about these outfits that would help you when the computer died. So I tried one out. It ended up being a scam. I needed to give them a credit card, which I did. But when it came time for them to help, they didn't. Then I noticed all the odd charges on my card. It was only small charges at first, then a big one. I knew for sure I never made it. It had to be the odd Dell computer helper people. I had to spend days figuring it out. My bank ended up refunding me the funds and helping out. It went by quickly and I was glad to have the help. But I will fix my own computer for now on.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY74I44WI
