I installed it and within an hour I had big red warning boxes popping up all over the screen saying my Windows 10 was compromised. There was a telephone number which I thought was microsoft so I called it. A guy with an Indian accent (naturally) answered and I told him my problem. Unfortunately, I could barely understand him so I asked to speak to an american-accented person. He hooked me up with another Indian person. By then, I was getting frustrated because I couldn't understand anybody but they seemed to understand what my problem was. So somebody else  came on online and gave me a quote for $225 to fix it and wanted my credit card number. At that point, I stopped and asked to make sure they were Microsoft but they never confirmed it in so many words (I thought about this afterwards). So I gave them my credit card number and they took over my computer and tried to fix the problem. The next day, I got the red error boxes again. I called them and wanted my money back and they said the charge was already gone through. I asked to speak to a manager, but nope, never got anybody else. I argued for a while with them and got nowhere. I hung up crying and called my bank and told them I was scammed. It took 2 days to get my money back from the bank. I can't believe this happened to me. I continually warn my friends about stuff like this. But now I know how scammers work. They scam you when you're vulnerable and have no other place to turn in the middle of your emotions! I swear, this will never happen to me again (I hope). I hope my bank is doing something about them - I got a letter afterwards explaining that it ""was"" a scamming company.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY74I44WI
