His auburn hair, his blue eyes and demeanor drew me in. He had a smile that could light up an entire room. Boys like that tend to draw me in. I was doomed from the start. We started off just talking and getting to know each other. Comments on social media turned to texting, texting turned to phone calls that lasted for hours, phone calls turned into a friendship. It didn't take very long for this fledgling friendship to turn into something more. At first, I was really scared about how much I liked him. Every time we hung out, went swimming and talked, I knew that I was in trouble with this one. I knew that he would be the one to break my heart. I mean, how could he not? He was everything I wanted and more. I found myself in love really quickly. Summer seemed infinite, and made it feel like this love would never end. I began to think that he may stick around even after camp ended. Maybe we could make this work. Maybe he was the one.. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We both agreed that long distance wouldn't work. It would be too hard, so we decided to end our relationship. It still hurts to this day, but I cherish every moment of what we had. Those memories are precious and will connect me with him forever. Memories are what makes love eternal, even when love isn't enough.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY77BI4WL
