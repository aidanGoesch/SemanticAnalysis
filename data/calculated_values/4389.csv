So we bought the Los Angeles tickets first and then we kept going from San Fran, them Seattle, then Jackson Hole , down to Colorado. we packed and gave notice to our bosses we would be gone over a month. My boss didn't want me to go but I knew I had to do it so he let me go, my girls boss said it was ok. So we left in June (late June) and traveled to Colorado first. We stayed with some of her family first on the way out west and I met some of her family. they were really nice and we first stopped at the arch in St Louis , and we went into the arch. we really had a great time. as we reached the first show we had been on the road a week and we had such a fun time. we went next up to Jackson Hole and drove through the Yellow Stone national PARK AND HAD A WONDERFUL TIME. If I ever moved out west I would really love to move to maybe the black hills area its so beautiful out there. Then we went to Seattle , and down to San Fran . We stayed with my Aunt & uncle for about 4 days and took them to dinner for their birthday. When we came back we went on route 66 most of the way and we had maybe 5 dollars left in money we budgeted for and riding in on fumes. To say the least I got my job back and she did as well. We had the experience of a lifetime and we are no longer together . As bad as that is It was my fault . I still love her and she is now married to another man But when I remember those times I know we both shared a moment in time that we both still say to this very day the happiest and best times of our lives..",3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY77BI4WL,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY77BI4WL
