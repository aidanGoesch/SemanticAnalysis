He had been sick for the past couple of years. He had heart failure and after having open heart surgery for major blockages in 3 arteries, he started going downhill fast. I was upset once I knew he wouldn't be getting any better. He and I hadn't been very close when I was growing up and our relationship only really started to blossom after I became an adult. He was never much of a kid person and he endured a lot in his life that made him the way he was, but he was genuinely a good man. I could really understand and relate to him after reaching adulthood myself and now that we were able to form a meaningful relationship and I could really enjoy him, it was too late. I feel robbed. However, he and my grandma had been together 50 years, so while it was hard on the whole family, it was especially hard for her. Watching and helping her go through the stages of grief as he was still alive was tough. There were times her denial of the situation was incredibly worrisome. I'd never had to deal with a situation like this so closely before so it was very difficult to know what was healthy under the circumstances and what could be a red flag. She's come through everything beautifully though and she's doing well now. Her faith is very important to her and she relies on God heavily in tough times. She feels confident about grandpa's situation and that puts her at peace. However, the remainder of my family isn't what it once was and it's devastating to me.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7G5NW4F
