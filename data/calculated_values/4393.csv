I was walking home, and had my bag with me. She stopped me and said she was amazed that the store was open since it was July 4th. The conversation started to branch out a bit and she was talking about how she was an immigrant from Eastern Europe. She was reminiscing bout the past and I asked her about life before technology and modernity. She was talking about how different it was and that it was even more different from her since she was from Estonian in Eastern Europe. After that, the conversation kept branching out. She started talking about how bad it was to have lived in a country that was part of the Soviet Union. Then she started saying how it all became better after Nazi Germany invaded her country. I was a bit shaken and repeated the words ""Nazi Germany"". She said yes, and said that Hitler made things better for her country. I was shocked and then mentioned how horrific he had been because of the Holocaust. She somewhat agreed saying that he shouldn't have gotten as far as killing all of those Jews, but she still sounded supportive of him. She sounded like somewhat of an apologist for Hitler. I mentioned that I was surprised because Hitler was such a horrible and evil person. She didn't seem too pleased by my description of him. The conversation ended soon after, and I was quite shocked to say the least.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7G65W4Z
