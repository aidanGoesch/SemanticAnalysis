I was trying to ask him what I should do to make money. I always knew that God would help me with my financial situation. Thankfully, the spirit gave me an answer. He said that I should start a drop shipping business on eBay. I am not the type of person to question Godâ€˜s judgment and I knew that he would provide for me. So I started the drop shipping business on eBay. The father provided me with the money the finances and the guidance that I would need. Within a few weeks I was already making a lot of money. There are a lot of expenses involved with this business, but the father provides for me. I also did not know how to run a business on ebay. Nor did I know the ins and outs of drop shipping. But the father provided guidance for me. I am blessed to be successful. Believing in the father and the Holy Spirit has provided me with material wealth.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7GAD4WN
