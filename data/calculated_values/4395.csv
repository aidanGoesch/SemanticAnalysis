It came from out of nowhere.  I tried to dismiss it, but I just kept hearing in my spirit: ""Start an Ebay business"".  Over and over again I kept feeling it.  As a Christian, I know when the Holy Spirit is guiding me to do something.  So, I began to look into it, and almost immediately, I came across a video about something called ""Dropshipping"". I didn't even know what Dropshipping was, but again, in my spirit I felt: ""Do that."".  I hadn't even clicked on the video yet.  But, I watched it and learned about dropshipping.  From there, the doors have just been opening up for me as I have started this eBay dropshipping business.  Probably the most surprising blessing in starting this, is that I needed the funds to start it.   I thought I needed to save up about $1,000 to start. But, I heard the Holy Spirit say: ""You don't need that much, you only need $400."" So, I prayed to be able to save $400 and the Spirit told me: ""Don't worry about it, I will provide.""  Sure enough, my Mother ended up getting a bonus check and she knew I was going into this and the amount of the check was just enough to give me that money to start, so I didn't even need to save up for it.   Since then, everything that I've prayed for has instantly come, to help me start the business.  Resources, software, training, it just falls right into my lap when I pray for it.  I just launched the business a couple of days ago, and I'm super excited for what happens next.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7GAD4WN
