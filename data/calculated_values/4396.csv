I was in college during that time. It was a not so wonderful period for me. I was interning for a job that despised. Everyday, someone complained about me to me. The mistakes were not my fault, but their fault. It was not the job that I dreamed about. It was a job with grueling tasks with no end in sight. So I started looking at a career change. It was hard to find an internship with a career related to my major. I went to several interviews and many rejected me. I still had to keep my old internship until I found a new one. Then someone from an opposing company came to visit. They noticed my work and asked if I would like to intern for them. Immediately I said yes. Ever since the change, I feel very satisfied and my skills have grown exponentially.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7Z644WP
