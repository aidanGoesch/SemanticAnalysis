So I was with a tour guide taking a tour of the city when I somehow got separated from the rest of the group. At first I wasn't bothered, I figured out I would run into them pretty quickly. But as time went on I realized that they had most likely left me behind. I started to panic a bit, I had no idea where I was and no idea how to even figure out my current location. Even if I did, I probably would not have figured out how to get back to the hotel I was staying at. At first I thought it was a good idea to just wait here where I last saw the group, hoping that they would possibly come back looking for me if someone noticed I was lost. But then I decided to at least take a walk around, maybe noticing a landmark or something that would help me figure out what to do next. I guess I looked pretty foolish, like a tourist, because a native Philippine approached me and asked if I needed any help. I can't even tell you how glad I was that someone actually decided to come over to help me out. I'm really shy, so I have problems talking to strangers on my own. I explained to her my situation and she gladly decided to help me out. I told her the name of my hotel and she instantly new where to go. The ride on her bike was some of the most fun memories I ever had in my life. She pointed out a lot of the history and culture of her city on our way to my hotel, our conversation was entertaining. When we finally got there we decided to hook up the next day. She'd show me around the city more, which was was fine with me. The next few days we hung out together was pretty damn fun. I can't believe I actually made a good friend a a foreign country.",,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RR344BOL
