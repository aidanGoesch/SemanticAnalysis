We didn't seem to have an issue getting pregnant at first, but we kept experiences losses at various points throughout each pregnancy. With each loss I lost myself a little more, and felt defeated, almost like I had done something wrong somewhere in my life to deserve some of the worst pain a person could ever experience. Our last loss was a third trimester loss, two days before my due date. Everything looked great through the pregnancy and I thought ""this is it, finally! we made it to the end safely"", until those dreams were shattered just as quickly as they pregnancy progressed. We discovered at a routine non stress test that the baby had no heartbeat and had passed from a cord accident. Even though each loss prior to this had been difficult, this was the worst. My entire life went dark and I no longer cared about anything. I can truly say this was darkest moment in my life. After months of suffering, my husband took me on a vacation to help me renew my spirit and mood, and surprise, we ended up getting pregnant on this trip. I felt so detached during this pregnancy and considered terminating as I was so certain it was going to end badly again. It is my pleasure to say it did not. Our daughter is now 2 months old, and while I fear that something horrible could still happen, I have never felt so much joy in my life. I never thought I would be given the chance to be a mother, and I thank God everyday for finally giving me the blessing of motherhood.",30BUDKLTXEHD45W08Q4G3BXLYEXE5T,30BUDKLTXEHD45W08Q4G3BXLYEXE5T
