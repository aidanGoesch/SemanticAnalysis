This year, we went to the Great Smoky Mountains.  My cousin came along since we are a close family.  We went on a Friday and left on a Sunday.  I was so excited for this trip that I bought myself a new camera to take pictures with.  The mountains there are beautiful and very photo worthy.  When we first got there, we decided to head to Dollywood first since it was about mid-day when we arrived.  It had been years since we went there so it was fun to see it again.  We all love Dolly Parton.  We rode the train and looked through all the shops since we aren't amusement park ride ride people.  It didn't look anything like I had remembered.  After that, we went to see Gatlinburg for a bit.  There were so many people there.  I don't remember it ever being so crowded before.  Then, it was time to settle in to the hotel for a bit.  The next day we went to all the shopping areas in Pigeon Forge.  I spent a lot of money.   I think my mom had a great birthday and me and my cousin had a great time!",3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RR6WMBOQ,
