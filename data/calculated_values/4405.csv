It was for my Grandpa. I remembered the good times I had with my Grandpa. I remember him taking me hunting one day. I got to kill a deer. He made the deer dinner that night. It wasn't bad to eat. I remember playing catch with him. He still had an arm on him. It was very fun playing catch. I also remember going to a restaurant one night. He had a big steak. I had a big lamb. They were both delicious. I also had beer that night. I hope he is in heaven right now. He will be remembered by many people. He will be loved by many people. He left a legacy on this world.",,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRBI6BON
