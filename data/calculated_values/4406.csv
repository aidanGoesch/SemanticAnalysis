These days, I live elsewhere in the country, and I had not been back to my hometown for many years.  I flew in the day before the service and rented a car to drive the rest of the way to that small town.  When I arrived, I was struck by how little the town and its topography had changed: there was a new Walmart, a few new businesses, but for the most part, things had remained similar to the way they'd always been.  I attended the service for my relative, who was a naval veteran in the Second World War, and the ceremony was attended by a number of men from his American Legion Post.  We also saw a number of people who were not familar to us.  When we asked after them, they claimed to have a distant cousin or other relative who had the same surname as my relative.  When they saw the obituary in the paper, they thought they should come and pay their respects.  Only in a place like that would strangers come to a service to pay their respects.  In the city where I now live, I can't imagine such a thing happening.  After the service, I drove back to my hotel and spent the night.  I left for the airport the next morning and returned home.  However, I was struck by the unusual, museum-like quality of that town, and while it has its charms, it made me grateful for the life I have now.  I think that many of the things I've been able to do in my life would not have been possible had I not left there.  However, I still remember the stable, rocklike nature of that place, and the genteel kindsness shown to my family while I was there.",,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRBI6BON
