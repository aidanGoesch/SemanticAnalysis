It was a destination wedding. I was not too far away. We were able to drive there in 4 hours. Quite a few guests did travel via airlines. It was the first time in almost 10 years all my extended family was planning to get together.  I have an adult son 35 who lives in Dallas. We don't get to see him a lot. He brought  his serious girlfriend Cristal. She was a lovely girl and it was great to meet her. They are still together. They recently moved in together.  My young daughter had a blast also. The last time we all gathered she was very young. This wedding was at a beautiful bed and breakfast. The weather was gorgeous. The most surprising thing was it hit me how old we all have gotten! There were 4 generations of the family there.,32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQ5JAR4C,32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQ5JAR4C
