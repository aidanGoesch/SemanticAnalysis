I had been dating my boyfriend for a couple of years, and he decided to break up our relationship. At the time I was very sad and didn't know how to move on without him. I had grown dependent on him, and it was hard to say goodbye. He was my first serious boyfriend and I thought we would end up getting married, which is why the breakup came as such a shock to me. I became very closed off and quiet at work, and my coworkers noticed. One day one of my coworkers pulled me aside and asked me what was wrong. It felt nice that someone cared about me and wanted to see what was bothering me. I vented to her about the situation and it made me feel better. I wasn't expecting anything more from the situation, and went on with my day as usual. The next day when I arrived at work I was surprised with flowers and chocolates in my office. It caught me off-guard, and I was very thankful for my thoughtful coworkers. It was a small gesture that lifted my spirits and made me realize everything was going to be okay. My coworkers showed me their support and for that I was very thankful. Although the breakup was hard, its nice to know I had people in my life who would try to cheer me up.",3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRDZ9OB3,
