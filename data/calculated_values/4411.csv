I recently broke up with my boyfriend, so the last few months have been hard. We were living together, so I've had to find a new place to live that I can afford on my own. I've never lived by myself before, so its been a struggle adjusting to being alone. I had thought that my boyfriend and I would get married, but I was sadly mistaken. Our relationship wasn't growing enough and we decided it was best to part ways. My coworkers noticed that I've been acting different lately and asked what was wrong. At first I didn't want to talk about it, but eventually I confided to one of my coworkers about what I've been going through. I could tell that she felt sympathetic towards my situation, and she told me that she went through something similar a few years ago. It felt nice to talk to someone about it, but I didn't expect what would come next. The next day I walked into work and was surprised to see that my office was filled with flowers and chocolates. On my keyboard there was a card from my coworker. Inside the card was positive quotes and uplifting messages from all of my coworkers to try and lift my spirits. I was surprised that my coworkers cared so much about me that they would surprise me in this way. I felt very appreciative, and was happy that I had people in my life who supported me.",3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRDZ9OB3,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRDZ9OB3
