We met online while both doing animal advocacy work, and began to bond over our love of helping animals. Our conversation slowly turned from our own animals and we began to learn more about each other. We began exchanging information, and eventually our online messages turned to phone calls and texts. We had so much in common, and there was just an instant chemistry and connection. We clicked. It was like a match had been ignited, and thus grew the flame of our love. I had found someone who valued the same things I did, and felt the same deep compassion I felt for animals. Being an animal advocate is an important part of who I am, and finding someone who felt animal advocacy was a core part of their being excited me. A coincidence, fate, whatever you call it- that was it. We instantly met and made things official. We dated for three years, and just last year became man and wife. It was picture perfect. Was. This person that I thought I knew, was a fraud. Three months ago, the man who supposedly held the same love for animals as me, actually did not. Not only does he not care for them, he is an animal abuser. I am crushed, and so disgusted that I was fooled for so long. When I see an abused animal now, deep in their eyes I feel it's like they're peering into my soul, seeing the monster that I was married to.",,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRE1MOBL
