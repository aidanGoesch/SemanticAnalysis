She wasn't just any dog. She was a true family member.  I had her for 12 years and literally grew up with her.  I got her in my teenage years and she passed in my 20s.  Some days it's harder to understand that she's actually gone.  I have to really think about it and I then understand that she couldn't of lived forever.  I wish she could have. There were so many places I would of liked to see with her.  She lived with me in 4 states and she loved every single one.  My dog enjoyed wilderness hikes and swimming in the ocean.  She was courageous.  I also looked up to her a lot.  She was very active even up to her last days.  I will cherish all of my memories with her.  I will also always wonder what it would be like if she had lived just a few years longer.",,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRNXXOBX
