We were really scared. Alex had to get knocked out cold with anesthesia. I don't remember what kind, but we were really worried. And we were also super worried about Alex's hearing. Alex was scared, too. Some nights he'd wake up crying and get in bed with us.  We were all worried about the whole thing.  The day we went in, the nurses and everybody, they were all so helpful. They took Alex in and got it done in under an hour while we waited. Well, thank God, it's over now, and the results are good!  Alex's hearing is completely fine. We're all breathing big sighs of relief! We do need to keep following up with hearing tests every six months, for now. This is probably nothing at all, but they want to follow it just to make sure. We're all so glad it's over!",,3OS46CRSLGLQPKI08Z3VVLZ7WT66VI
