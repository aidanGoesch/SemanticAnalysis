This is such a specialized thing that we had to take him to a children's hospital and hour and a half away.  Since he is so young he had to be sedated for the test, which was done in a hospital operating room.  It was a scary situation because he had to be completely put to sleep for that.  When we got to the hospital he had to have an exam prior to the test, of which he hated.  He was already scared and very confused, he had just turned three a month prior and has no verbal communication skills so that makes this even worse.  We had to hold him down on the table in the operating room so that they could hold the anesthesia mask on him.  It was so hard to do and very upsetting to watch him because you could see the fear in his eyes.  Once he was asleep we went and got some lunch. Within 30 they were calling to tell us they were done with the test.  We went back to the room and waited for him to wake up and got the test results.  It came out normal and all was well.  We had to wait for a little while to make sure that he was not going to have any after effects of the anesthesia or any vomiting.  We were then free to take him and head home.
