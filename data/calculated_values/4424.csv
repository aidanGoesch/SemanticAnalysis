Sad to say, I know. I was realistic about it. I was logical.  Weirdly so, while I was realistic about it, I felt that I was also in denial about many things. It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were. I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me. I remember it all sinking in. I was disappointed. It was hurtful. I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal. She was selfish for a very long time. I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise. I am not even sure that's what caused it.  Maybe the timing was just a coincidence. I knew cutting her out of my life would hurt her. I never imagined it would cause her life to unravel. Again, I don't even know if me cutting her out of my life was what caused her life to unravel. I imagine it played somewhat of a role, though. When my grandparents sat me down and described how she had hit rock bottom just a week ago, I was shocked. I don't really know why I was shocked, though. She never really was on the right track in life. Her alcoholism finally caught up with her. How could you end up fired, in jail and confessing to alcoholism all in a matter of four days! My family was torn apart by it and I decided not to stick around for it.",,3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIDM1EBF7
