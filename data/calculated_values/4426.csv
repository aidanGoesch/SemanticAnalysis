I still can't believe that she is going to do it. I feel like the past two years of focusing on reconciliation, was for nothing. I also don't believe that she is thinking of the kids. Having parents that were divorced and growing up in that environment, is the last thing I wanted for the kids. I don't think that my wife realizes how this is going to impact the kids. I am so sad, frustrated and upset by all,of this. All I wanted was to restore our family. I miss my wife. I miss being with the kids everyday. I miss us being a family. I continue to pray for healing and restoration, but I'm losing hope. I know God is in control, but I am struggling. I think about when the tragedy that struck our family just over 2 years ago and never thought it would result in our family separating. All I can do is focus on God and be strong for the kids and let them know that we are still a family.",3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIDM1EBF7,3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIDM1EBF7
