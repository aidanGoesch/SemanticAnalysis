Although, I am self-reliant and self-sufficient. Also I don't put much thought to the future. Well, I recently met up with a woman I went to high school with. I'm 37, so it was quite a while ago when we knew each other. We met up and started talking again through Facebook. We soon decided to get together in person and see what happens. We hit it off immediately and decided to start dating exclusively. I can't imagine not having her around now and she changes my life for the better in every way! I have re-enrolled in college and am striving to better myself across all aspects. She makes me want to be a better man and settle down and maybe even start a family. This is a huge step for me. Time will tell. Our future is ahead of us! There really is no substitute for love.",,32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQOR9R4A
