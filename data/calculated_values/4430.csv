He looked terrified. I went to the next exit to get off and go back around to see if I could get him. I pulled my car over a little ahead of him. He had a collar on so I knew he was somebody's pet. I was very nervous as it was a busy time on the freeway. Cars kept wizzing by us. I tried to crouch down and slowly walk towards him. I had my hand stretched out as I walked. I could see him visibly shaking. I slowly walked toward him and he made a couple steps towards me. I kept imagining grabbing him by the collar. I wonder if he would bite me. I got closer and closer to him. I was just in reach of him when a huge truck flew by and blared his horn. It was a loud, jarring noise that caused the dog to panic. He turned away from the divider and ran headlong into the traffic where he was hit by a car. He kept getting run over by all the subsequent cars. It was a terrible thing to witness.",3OSWBBLG1FJHEI2AI1CRPC6KJEBDXW,
