This is the earliest in the year that I have been to Alaska, and the entire trip was cold and full of snow. This was very surprising and unexpected given the weather forecast, but I had a wonderful trip anyway. It was starting to get hot at home in Ohio, so I was welcoming the cold. I traveled by myself and had many spiritual experiences in both urbanized Alaska and in the wilderness. One of the most memorable parts was visiting the Eklutna spirit houses, which are one of my favorite locations in the world. The spirit houses are traditional yupik burial grounds. Since the permafrost, even in Southcentral Alaska is very hard, burials are traditionally not performed in the ground. Rather, remains are placed on top of the earth, and a small house is hand-built around them. Each spirit house is a work of art, and they were mostly made by friends and/or family of the deceased. I can spend hours there every time I visit to wander among the houses and to learn about the people that are resting there. I am surrounded by a sense of death and peace when visiting there, and going there is always an intense, emotional, visceral experience. I felt connected to the entire earth and to the native peoples that are eternally resting there. I stayed for hours thinking about my partner, my history, and my purpose in life. It was truly a life-changing experience. I come away from Eklutna with a sense of renewed purpose every time I visit. It is a truly amazing place, and one I hope to return to someday to continue my spiritual journeys there.",,3OSWBBLG1FJHEI2AI1CRPC6KR16DX9
