I had a blast. I saw so many family and friends. We laughed and talked and just had so much fun. I don't usually dress up so the fact we had too was really fun for me. I did my hair and make up and had a really nice dress. The weather was perfect. The ceremony was really nice. They did such a great job at the entire thing. The food was amazing. The music was great too. We danced and dance late into the night. Drinks flowed freely all night. I am really glad I decided to go. I can't wait until the next family function.  I took a lot of photos and well get them together for an album soon. I am also going to send the newlyweds copies of many of my photos. They turned out so good.,,3OUYGIZWR8KI6PZPKYEFGS0YMCOP0T
