It was fun.  We danced the night away the other week.  It was in West Virginia.  We had to dress up.  It was super fancy and everything.  We really did like what we had to wear for it was super fancy and we did not usually wear this type of clothing at all.  That really made it fun.  We both had a blast. It took seven hours to get there.  That really was a long drive.  I was not anxious at all over the course of the drive.  My girlfriend drove.  She is a good driver.  Her mom went with us.  She was flipping out.  It was rather hillarious to hear her make a big deal out of mothing.,3OUYGIZWR8KI6PZPKYEFGS0YMCOP0T,3OUYGIZWR8KI6PZPKYEFGS0YMCOP0T
