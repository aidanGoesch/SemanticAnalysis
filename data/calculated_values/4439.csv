The CompTIA certifications are information technology certs that allow you to open the door to entry-level IT positions. I didn't go to college and am not an intelligent person, but I've always been good with computers. I'm 25 years old and figured that I needed to do anything to finally jumpstart a career for myself. So I started using free resources online to help study for my A+ test. I spent 8 hours a day researching and cramming information that was foreign to me. I was afraid because I don't have a good track record with keeping up with new interests, and I was terrified that I would give up on this. Of course, I was also afraid that I would not pass. As I said, I am not a smart person by nature and the test has a fee so there was a possibility of losing cash and also a new career opportunity. But somehow I persisted and took the test last week. I was nervous and almost sweating when I entered the testing center. Sitting down I knew deep inside myself that I wasn't going to pass this test, and I hated myself for wasting that money on such a stupid idea. But then I actually started, and very quickly the information I stored in my head came up as the questions were presented. It was much easier than anticipated! With a newfound sense of confidence I made my way through each question in the bunch. I ended up passing. It was not a perfect score, but it was enough to get myself certified and that was all I really wanted. I was so proud of myself on that day, and I don't think I've felt that pride in myself ever before, or at least not that heavily.",3OUYGIZWR8KI6PZPKYEFGS0YVDOP04,3OUYGIZWR8KI6PZPKYEFGS0YVDOP04
