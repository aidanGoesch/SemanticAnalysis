I had never seen that side of him before and it came out of nowhere. One minute we were sitting around laughing and the next I was up against the wall as I was being yelled at and spit on. Alcohol. Alcohol does this to people. People that you would least expect it to. I didn't even know my fiance was having any problems. He never told me of any emotional issues or issues at work that he was dealing with. That's the thing about men though, they bottle everything up inside of them because it's not ""manly"" to vent. We had never even had an argument. I didn't do or say anything to make him mad. It literally just happened in the blink of an eye. People that drink every day are covering up problems. It's not normal to come home and get drunk every night. This is the number one sign and I missed it. I should've seen that something was wrong and for that I partially blame myself.",3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMV0ONZDM,
