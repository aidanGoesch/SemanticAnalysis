We connect together, have great times, and get along fairly well. However, I noticed that he likes to drink alcohol and when he drinks and he's stressed he becomes belligerent and just flat out mean. One night it got so bad that he was forehead to forehead with me screaming in my face. Talk about how little I felt. He began kicking furniture and throwing stuff. He was even screaming and slamming doors while my 4 year old was asleep in the next room. This was just disgusting to me. Someone that I learned to love and care for was treating me like a dog for no reason. It really sucked because I do everything for everyone in my household except myself. I cook, clean, do the laundry, shop for them the clothes that they need, and run the errands. I never ask for anyone to do anything for me. For someone who I seen as so good-hearted and loving to treat me like that was astonishing. It really made me question my decision to be with him and wonder if it was the right thing for my son. We had just made announcements with an engagement shoot to put on Facebook too. I hated to tell the whole world that we had broke up after just being engaged. My heart was torn.",3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMV0ONZDM,3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMV0ONZDM
