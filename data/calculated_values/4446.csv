We usually don't do this. Not for any particular reason, but because we never really thought to do it. However, one day, I thought it would be a good idea. Everyone had been feeling a little bit down because of the death of our house cat, Bubbles. Nonetheless, we invited all of our family friends, along with some of my cousins, aunts, and uncles. We had planned to make it for Saturday, and the goal was just to make it a fun family/friend gathering where we could all enjoy ourselves playing some games. And we sure did! Everyone came, and there was a total of 20 people at our house that night. My mom, dad, and sister were all pretty excited and so was I. We had chosen a lot of family board games to play along with some card games. At one point, everyone in the room could not stop laughing over the dumbest thing. It was slap happy hour apparently. It was probably the greatest game night everyone there had ever experienced, and I'm not exaggerating. It was a fun time with my family and friends. I love all of them so much, and this night will forever be a good memory.",,3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMV1QFDZX
