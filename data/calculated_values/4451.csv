Most people who know me already know that Girl Scouts have been a tradition in my family dating back to my childhood. So it was a big moment when my daughter made rank at the court of honor ceremony three weeks ago. She has worked extremely hard over the last year selling all sorts of items including cookies. I know over Christmas she sold more boxes of cookies than any Girl Scout has ever sold in the history of her troop. So it's not like her making rank was a huge surprise to us, but that doesn't make it any less of an honor. In addition the troop also named me an official Scout Mom. I was thrilled with this distinction for two reasons. First, it's exactly the same title my mom had when I was a young Scout. And secondly, I get to plan more activities for the troop going forward. I can't wait for our camping trip coming up where I will act as a chaperone. I know my daughter is very excited that I will be to share in this experience with her. In all there were 12 other girls who were recognized alongside my daughter, including three of her very best friends. I couldn't be happier with how grown up and mature she's been since we signed her up. And I can't wait to see how greatly this Girl Scouts experience shapes here as she grows and matures in a woman.",,3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMVZ14ZDS
