Our kids are getting older and it is a bit easier to travel.  They have always wanted to go on an airplane somewhere.  Didn't matter where, they just wanted to experience it.  So we looked into some options and decided we would fly from Massachusetts to Myrtle Beach.  We did not tell them that we were planning on doing it.  We wanted it to be a surprise.  About a week before we were going to go, we told them with a card and some things to bring.  The look on their faces was priceless.  They jumped around for about an hour and could not wait to tell everyone they knew.  We took this vacation that last week in June 2019.  We flew out of a local airport down to Myrtle.  The whole time, the kids had smiles from ear to ear.  We spent an entire week at a resort right on the beach.  My whole family loves the beach so it was the perfect setting.  The day we had to come back they were so upset but excited to go back on the plane.  When the trip was over, the first thing they asked was when we could do it again.  It made my wife and I feel so happy.  We will definitely look to do this again soon.  Maybe next time a longer flight as well.",3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMVZ15ZDT,3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMVZ15ZDT
