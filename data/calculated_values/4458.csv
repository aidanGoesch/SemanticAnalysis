There was still some work that needed to be done as well as some assessments of the location.  It was about mid morning as we were traveling north bound on the highway.  About 40 minutes into the drive traffic started to get a little heavier as we hit the Boston area.  My boss was to the right of me in the back seat and I had two fellow employees in the front.  All of a sudden I heard my boss say whoa! My fellow colleague whom was driving said the same thing.  I couldn't really see from my vantage point of what was occurring, but we had a box truck in front of us slam hard on its break.  We soon followed as well.  Traffic started to slow and it seemed to happen so quick.  All of a sudden you see a Fed-ex truck in front of the truck that was ahead of us swerve hard to the right.  Then it almost felt like a movie where things slowed down and the truck went head on into a guard rail and the back end of it turned into the guard rail and the truck flipped over on to its side over the rail.  Traffic came to a dead stop and we could see the driver unclip his seat belt and fall to the roof of the cab.  He then crawled out of the truck.  It was good to see him get out OK.  There were packages and debre everywhere.",3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GL8YPQ4S,
