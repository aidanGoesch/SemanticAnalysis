It was the first Thanksgiving I had with my whole family since I was in my early 20's. It came a few months after my mother had a stroke. I come from a fairly large family (3 brothers and three sisters) so it was interesting to have us all under one roof with our now husband/ and or wives and our children. It was not one moment of calm, it was total chaos and way too much energy for me. Especially the fact that I am a bit of a hypochondriac and my family and I were on an airplane for nearly 6 hours. Not too mention going to a climate that is much dryer and much more hotter and or coldrer depending on the time of day that where we live. I found myself feeling ill and just wanting to rest the whole time. Unfortunately with so many people in one big house there was no time for that. We managed to have an enjoyable time. We cooked together, watched movies together. The kids got off of their devices for a short time and actually played board games. I purchased my mom a champagne cake made by an award winning bakery (very expensive) because her birthday was in mid November. We were all very happy, and were appreciative that my mom is still with us. That week was the most memorable because it was a fun family time and I am not sure when it will happen again.",,3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLB5N4QL
