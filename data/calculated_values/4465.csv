Originally, he wanted to eagle out at 12 years old. However, his scoutmaster thought he would get more out of it by waiting and continuing to go on the monthly camp outs and earning merit badges. Looking back, even my grandson agrees that it was a good idea to wait. It did take a while to get the eagle project finished. What is so very memorable about it is how dedicated my grandson was to doing everything right. He cared about the project and wanted to do the best job possible. Scouts do all the work themselves while the adults watch over to give constructive suggestions and make sure everyone stays safe. My grandson put everything together from measuring the stage, determining how much lumber he would need, nails, etc. He got other scouts to volunteer to help and the local home improvement store donated the supplies. They started working on the new stage at 9:00 in the morning and finished by 7:00 pm. The scouts worked very hard and thoroughly earned their pizza! The following weekend my grandson returned to complete the project. He put a new coat of weather resistant varnish on the stage to preserve the wood and on the guardrails. It only took him two hours so put on the finishing touch. I am very proud of my grandson and so it the troop!",3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLJAYQ40,
