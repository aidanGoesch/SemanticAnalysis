Earning the eagle rank took a lot more time than I thought it would. It took him four months to get everything completed and approved by the Boy Scout Council before he was promoted to eagle. Both his parents work so I got to help him with his project. First we talked about what type of project he wanted to do and for which organization. He contacted the local zoo and asked if he could do his eagle project there. But after leaving several unanswered messages over four weeks, we talked it over and he decided to contact the local nature park. It was pretty much the same scenario he encountered with the zoo. When he finally got someone on the phone, he was told to contact someone else. I ended up calling the site director and asking if they wanted him to do the eagle project for them or not. I was assured the nature park had a lot of projects and someone would get in touch with my grandson shortly. However, after two weeks of silence, he contacted our church pastor and found out there were two projects that would work for his eagle rank. He spoke with the pastor and got approval from the church committee to rebuild the outdoor stage and add an access ramp for handicapped people. Once he got church approval, he sent the paperwork to Council and was approved about a month later. I can't tell you how proud I was of the way he took charge of the situation. He didn't get discouraged or give up but kept calling and talking to people to get just the right project. I was surprised that it only took one full Saturday to get all the construction done.  I started crying when I saw that almost the entire troop and six adult leaders were there to help him. He took charge of the construction and assigned each scout and adult a specific task. I was there to help out as needed, order pizza and make sure there was enough food and sodas to go around. They started at 8:00 am and finished around 7:00 pm. A month later he had his Eagle Court of Honor and formally received his eagle rank, plaque and awards. His parents stood on the stage beside him while I sat in the audience and cried. We are so proud of him and the way he took on his duties and responsibilities to the troop and himself.",3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLJAYQ40,3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLJAYQ40
