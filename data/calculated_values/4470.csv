I traveled via plane and got there in the afternoon. I arrived early and had to wait around for my dad to come pick me up. When I got there, the trip wasn't bad at first but it soon devolved into a lot of ugliness like it usually tends to when I'm around family. My brother and my father had been drinking and were talking about politics, controversial things, and the nation in general. They began talking in ways that were really racist and upsetting. I made the stupid mistake of trying to reason with them and it ended really badly. They were saying overtly racist things while laughing about it, all the while saying they weren't racist. My dad said to me at one point ""I'm not racist, I even hire them"" and I just felt like my eyes rolled so hard that they might actually roll down my nasal passages, into my throat, down into my stomach, and sizzle there for a while. I got angry and I left the room. I slammed the door to my bedroom and accidentally broke the frame. My dad never noticed, and I called it half justice for the garbage he was spewing. I remember he said one thing about natural black hairstyles that made me sick. When I questioned if he knew why those hairstyles were important and useful to people he responded ""To keep the bugs out?""It was a really frustrating and upsetting event. I want badly to love my family, but they make it really hard. Not to mention that we, ourselves, are half puerto rican on my late mother's side. What would he have done if we'd ended up with a little more melanin? I just hated that trip.",3OWEPKL08AYWLFNWPIMWRI5Q2J5N7V,
