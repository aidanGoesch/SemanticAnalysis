My dad and my brother were taking about people of different races and kept laughing about how they weren't racist and how they thought that other races complained too much about their issues. My dad said ""I even hire them!"" in reference to black people. But when he criticized black hairstyles, I questioned him. I asked him if he knew why black people even wore some of those hairstyles, (they're protective hairstyles). My dad said something that disgusted me to my core. He said, ""To keep the bugs out?"" The level of ignorance that my dad exhibits is so upsetting to me, even now. I try to make peace with the fact that he is who he is but it's really difficult to. I feel depressed, I feel anxious, and I hate that I can still hear them laughing. I'm half puerto rican.  My brother is too. My dad is Italian. I don't think he knows how uncomfortable all of this is and how racist he is. But I hate knowing that those are my roots, that my roots are so so racist. My mom isn't around anymore and I really wish that she was. I know that she wouldn't have let him talk like that without reprimand.",3OWEPKL08AYWLFNWPIMWRI5Q2J5N7V,3OWEPKL08AYWLFNWPIMWRI5Q2J5N7V
