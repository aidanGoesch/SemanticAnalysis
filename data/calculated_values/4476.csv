We always celebrate for at least three days.  Once with family, once with friends and then a night out with our significant other.  On this birthday it came and went and no one hardly mentioned it.  My husband wished me a happy birthday but didn't take me out.  I couldn't understand that and I was really quite hurt.  Even at work I didn't get a cake or anything which is unusual.  Three days after my birthday my husband said we were going to our marina to spend the night on our boat.  He told me to dress up though in case I wanted to go out to dinner or something.  I thought it was odd but I dressed up anyway and when we got to the marina there were more cars there than usual and I started seeing familiar faces and realized it was a surprise party for me.  I can't even express the happiness I felt.  I had never in my life have anyone give me a surprise party.  It was my daughter who had planned it and to this day I can't figure out how they kept it a secret.  My co-workers were there, my family and my friends.  It was a huge party and it's a memory I will never forget and I'm extremely grateful to my daughter for having it for me.",,3OWEPKL08AYWLFNWPIMWRI5Q5357NM
