I got a Funko Bulbasaur POP. I also got some Pokemon cards and posters about Detective Pikachu for my brother. We watched the movie later that day. It was a fun movie but was very bland. I decided to play with my POP. I made it walk on the ground. I made it fly in the air. I made sure to keep it away from my dog. My dog wanted to chew on it. He thought it was food. That is adorable. I gave the dog a nice pat on the head. I threw a ball to distract him from the POP. I had a fun time with the POP. I hope there are more of these in the future.",,3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7O2QZ632
