I was so excited. Everyone around the US was picking up their Bulbasaur from Target and I wanted to be there the day of release since there were limited quantities. I've been playing Pokemon since it came out and I was glad that it was becoming more popular which meant more Pokemon gear for me. I didnt necessarily like the bandwagon fans or fake fans, but who can complain when you can buy more gear due to popularity. It was on a Saturday and in addition to this, the Pokemon movie ""Detective Pikachu"" just came out and I was going to watch it with my brother. It was 11 am. I went with my mom to Target because she had to go to the mall area any way. We hurried to Target and looked around. I remember looking sad because we couldnt find them until we went to this huge display table and there were two Bulbasaur and a bunch of Pokemon cards and Posters to promote the movie. I ran to it and even got a snapchat of my reaction to finding it. The case was as big as me. I carried it all the way to the cashier and paid for it immediately. I also got posters and Pokemon cards for my brother. He was happy to receive them.",3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7O2QZ632,3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7O2QZ632
