My cousin decided to bring this friend. At first he was cool and down to earth. However, when alcohol was involved I saw them take a turn for the worst. They started to provoke my family in ways that made me mad. I thought I should just try to remove him from the situation. It started to get physical after that. I saw that my cousin lost control of the situation and he assisted me in removing them. It was something out of a horror film to be honest. This random cam out of no where and just started threatening people. It was at that point I was like enough is enough. We called the police afterwards. He ran back to wherever he came from. It was something that weekend. I wont forget this for years to come.",,3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7OVXH63R
