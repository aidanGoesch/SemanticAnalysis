We decided to take the whole family to the Woodland Park Zoo near Seattle, WA.  We arrived early, before the crowd, and it was a beautiful day.  My son loves all animals but was specifically excited to see the lions.  We got lucky.  The lion was a huge male with a big mane.  He was up and walking around which is something we don't often get to see.  He even gave us a couple of roars which was thrilling for my son but scared my 1 year old daughter quite a bit.  We had a picnic in the middle of the zoo and then my son got to ride the carousel.  We continued our day at the zoo and got to see many of my son's favorite animals. After the zoo we headed home, grilled some burgers and hot dogs, and had cake and ice cream.   We then got to let me son open presents.  He was thrilled to see that he had got many of the animals he had seen at the zoo in one of his gifts.  He was also excited for the Nerf Gun and bubbles he opened.  My son got up the next morning and asked if he could have another birthday!",3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7OWA3634,3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7OWA3634
