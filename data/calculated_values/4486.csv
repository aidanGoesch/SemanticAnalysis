He is 85 and getting frail so any small illness or virus could really be a problem. We ended up taking him to the emergency room. He had to have a procedure to clear his lungs. He was in the hospital for a few days. During this time I was checking on him and staying with him as much as could. I also had to care for my elderly mother during this time. It is a challenge to have aging parents and have to help care for them while also keeping up with your own responsibilities. I work full time and I have young children so this was really a challenge. I had a lot of work duties during this week and I had to ask for extra help. I am lucky that I have very nice neighbors whose daughters helped me watch my children. Unfortunately my spouse does not really step up to help in times like these. I was just relieved he took care of himself. I was considering hiring outside help for my parents but I wanted to be the one there for them. I did hire some help for housekeeping at my home and my parents' home.,,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWFNDLOR
