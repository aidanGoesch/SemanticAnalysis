Nothing out of the ordinary. I was pretty tired though and was more than ready to head home for the day. I got in to my car and put on my favorite band, Metallica. I headed towards the freeway. I got on the freeway and there didn't look like there was much traffic. I saw someone ahead of me. They were swerving. I didn't want to be behind them so I figured I could get around them and it would be safe. When I tried to go around them they swerved right in to me and I crashed off the road. I was going about 60mph when I crashed. Thankfully my airbag deployed. I was safe but it could have turned out a whole lot worse. I was frightened by this whole thing. I really think it has changed me forever because I struggle with anxiety with driving now. But I'm trying my best to work through it. I've started driving on the freeway again. I think I will be ok.",,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWN3LOL6
