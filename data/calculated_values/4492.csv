I am (by my own admission) a control freak and I hate things being unplanned or unanticipated. We arrived at the venue over an hour before the start time and already the main parking lot was full, as was the overflow parking. Eventually I was dropped off on the curb while my family went to find parking. Inside the venue, security was as chaotic as the parking. There were over 1500 people being naturalized and 3 airport-style security checkpoints. The wait was long and it made me even more anxious. There were tannoy announcements that everyone in the room at this time would be found a space in the naturalization ceremony, but that didn't do anything to calm me down when I was 1000 people back in line. Finally through the security, the actual event hall was also incredibly unorganized. Go to this table, no actually that table, to get your packet, then sit here. Why are you sitting there?! Finally, with minutes to spare I was in my seat and reading my documents. I was still stressed though because my family was still looking for parking and not yet in the building. I was sweating and my heart was racing, what should have been a memorable day was turning out to be memorable for all the wrong reasons.  When the ceremony finally began, all that faded away. The judge welcomed us all to the US, and mentioned our responsibilities as citizens. We all took the oath and then they played the national anthem and a music video. By this point I was in tears - tears of joy. Tears of relief. Tears of belonging (is that a thing?).The day was a mess, the venue should be ashamed of the way they 'organized' it all. But overall, its the day I became an American citixen and that is what I will remember.",3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWNCKOLN,
