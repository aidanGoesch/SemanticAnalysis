It looks as though I will be hiding out in my room unless they warn us to get to the storm shelter. 12 pm: It looks a bit cloudy outside and I have heard thunder a few times but nothing serious. The storm is now projected to be here between by late tonight or tomorrow morning so we will shall see.  I think I am going to curl up and try to read a book this whole situation has me on edge. 8 pm: Woke up in recliner to little brother snoring on the couch but still no storm so far.  I am going to go try to go back to sleep in my own room. 12 am: Woke up to a text from Jen tried to sneak out but got caught by mom, but its not even storming! Sunday 10 am: Woke up, no storm still. Looks partly cloudy, weather channel still predicts 50 percent chance of hurricane until 1 pm and everyone is freaked out. But it really don't seem to be happening. I still cant leave the house.  2 pm: Nothing happened, the whole thing got called off.   To top this whole thing off I am grounded for trying to sneak out. 6 pm: Helped mom serve dinner and cleared the table, I even washed dishes. 8 pm: Not much to report, hopefully I will be off punishment by next weekend so long as I behave myself and keep sucking up.",,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWQWJOLT
