Some of them have months of recovery already, some have a few days, but it's always unique. Each person comes in with their own personalities, pasts, goals, strengths & weaknesses. A couple months ago someone who has worked with our house before had recommended a new guy to me. He explained to me that he was struggling in another house with other guys harassing him and making it hard for him to sleep. I took this new guy in without fully vetting him personally, because I trusted the person who was vouching for him. This turned out to be a mistake on my part, and a lesson learned. As it turned out, the problems he was having in his last sober living was related to the manic episode he was going through that our mutual friend was unaware of when he brought him to my sober living. For the next 3 weeks the entire house was on edge. He was abrasive, intense, and was always trying to do things his own way instead of following the rules. Most of these rules were little things that we give warnings about, we give people a chance to correct them, and because he didn't break any major rules I couldn't just kick him out. I COULD have, but I wouldn't feel right doing it, for something so small. As time went on it became clear to me that this was not going to change. We went to great lengths to give him a real opportunity to make it work at our house. He got on the right medication and was taking it, we were giving him plenty of 'growing room'. When it became apparent to me that this was going to be an issue, I decided I would give him advanced notice that we would not be accepting his next months fees and he should start looking for a new place to live. After hearing this, he tried to turn a new leaf - apologize to people in the house, apologize to me, but by then the damage had already been done and the people were incredibly uncomfortable living with him. A week went by and I reminded him that his time at our house was coming to an end. I made it very clear, but it was obvious to me he was not fully comprehending it, he was in deniable about the situation. On the last day I figured he would try to leave the house early to go to work and get home late, putting us in the uncomfortable position of having an argument and having to kick him out on the street in the middle of the night. I decided I would have to talk with him before he left. I heard him stirring around 3 in the morning, I told him that today was the day, he attempted a rebuttal and I reiterated that today was the day. He finally accepted the fact, and took out all his frustration about the situation out on me. He became very bitter, insulting me, calling me a 'F-ing coward' and left the house in a storm of anger.",,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWQX8OLK
