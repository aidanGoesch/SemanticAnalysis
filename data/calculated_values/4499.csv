I couldn't decide between Italian or Mexican cuisine. I decided to eat Italian on a coin toss, and thank god I did; the table next to me was a young, beautiful women, crying alone. On her table was two dinner, with one plate being untouched. While I initially ignored her, her sobbing grew louder and louder, until I had to intervene. I asked her to calm down, wondering about why she was crying. Perhaps she set up a date and was ignored? ""I'm sorry that I'm crying. My fiance died one year ago from today..."" I was stunned at this response and asked if I could sit with her and comfort her. She agreed, and I canceled my order and held her shoulder. We sat there for 20 minutes, before she left. While I was happy to comfort her, she later entered back and gave me her contact information; she wanted to meet again. 6 Weeks AgoWe met again at the same restaurant, and she kindly asked for a kiss. I was initially stunned, but I brushed it off as a desire for her to pretend that I'm her boyfriend. She admitted that she was in love with me, and how I made her feel good after comforting her. I shared similar feelings towards her; she was stunning and beautiful. 1 Month AgoThis is our fifth time meeting up for a date, but this time, I have a special surprise for me. She has moved my heart in the last month, and I adore everything about her. Her voice is soft, her skin shines in the sun, and her hair flows like silk. There is a small ring in my bag, one that I wish to propose to her. I met a woman who is beautiful, and amazing. I am no longer single, and no longer lonely. This is a marriage that will last forever.",,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWZPKOLP
