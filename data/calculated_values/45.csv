I decided to go all out when I got up there, since there was plenty of things to do I took my time and truly explored the region of Toronto in general.  The falls were truly breathtaking, and the water was quite cold since it was still winter time when I went.  Once I had my fill of the Falls I also checked out the Chinese cuisines that Toronto had to offer, and I was not disappointed, the food was truly amazing.  The vegetables were fresh, and crisp, while the rice was truly perfect, not too hard, and not too soft, but a good balance of firmness.  I also decided to see the CN tower, and was truly mesmerized by the sheer size of that structure, especially since it was right there, in downtown Toronto.  The sunset was also breathtaking and beautiful, but I don't think that is a strong enough word for how magnificent the sunset truly was.  I loved the trip because I do love exploring and just getting out and doing something different, exploring places I've never been before, and seeing the sheer beauty and raw power of nature, like the Falls provide.  The Chinese food was quite exquisite, as was the CN tower.   I would definitely recommend a trip like this one to my friends because it was such a nice place to go and see.  I think seeing the Falls and the CN tower should be on anyone's bucket list because of just how surreal the tower was, and how serene the Falls were, with that power, and sound of all of the water rushing.  The drive was a little bit rough from Kentucky, since the traffic also isn't kind once I got to Cincinnati, and then from there it just seemed to pick up more when I got up to Toledo and into Detroit.  I think it took me about 14 hours to drive up, I didn't stay at a hotel or anything, although I did take some pit stops to get food, fuel, and other various supplies.  I think I liked seeing the CN tower most, just because of how staggering it looks, right there in downtown Toronto, and also it's proximity to the rest of the city made it a very convenient place to visit while being close to the hotel and restaurants.  The Falls were a little bit far from the city, but not bad.  In closing, I'd like to say that this trip opened my eyes to what North America has to offer in general, and also what our northern neighbors have to offer also in terms of natural and man-made beauty.",,30BUDKLTXEHD45W08Q4G3BXLZ1JE5Q
