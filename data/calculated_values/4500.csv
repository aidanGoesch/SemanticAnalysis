Recently I met someone that loves me for me. We used to talk on the phone a lot in the past. One day we seen each other at the coffee shop. I did not know it was her, since she was dressed in a costume. I was for sure I was getting hit on, by a woman i do not even know. Anyways, she asks me, if I would dance with her at the coffee shop, outside in the rain. Of course, I said yes. We talk for about an hour, and that is when she reveals her face to me. I am very shocked, and baffled. She said, ""I knew I would find you here"". The day was over, and the night sky was out. Stars remind me of her. She asked if I would marry her. Do you know what i said?.........Yes!!!!! I can not believe this just happened.",,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWZPKOLP
