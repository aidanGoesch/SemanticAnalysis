We were driving on the back road which is a two lane road that usually don't have a lot of traffic but there are some sharp turns on the road. It was mid morning I think, we were talking about what we were going to do that day and planning how to work that day. Then we saw the sharp turn and we made sure that we slowed down a little bit. Just about when we passed the turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and before I can react it flew right off the road and then went into the bushes. I have never seen anything like that happened in my life and in front of my eyes!!!!! It was so horrible and felt that it is unreal!! It landed on the side of it, the driver seems like he had a hard time get out too. So we parked on the other side of the road and ran out to help him. At that time there was no other cars on the road or passing by. I was calling the cops and my friend went over to check on the driver. Finally there was someone drove by and stopped to help us. At that time, there was also something leaking like a gas tank leaking in the back of the car. The guy got that tank out and shut the valve. My friend and the guy were trying to pull the driver out. Then this Spanish lady drove by, stopped, came out of the car and was crying, she came to me asked what is going on and is the driver ok, she was crying so hard and she was telling me that she told the driver to drive slow, but he didn't listen. So I knew by then that she was his friend, I held her and told her that everything will be ok, they are trying to get him out, the cops are on the way too. I was shaking but I know that if I don't remain calm it will scare her even more.  Later the cops were asking us about the details of the accident, so she was there looking at the car and waiting for them to get the driver out. We were done doing the report and was ready to leave, she asked for the contact information she said she will pay us, but we said everyone under that situation would do the same thing and we don't need any reward or pay. We were just doing what normal people would do. We told her we hope her friend recovers soon and then we left.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB,
