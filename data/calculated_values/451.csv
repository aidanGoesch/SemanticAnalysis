I'm 50 years old and have the 3 most amazing children in the world. Their ages are 25, 19 and 20 ( almost 21). Two boys and a girl (the youngest). I spent the vast majority of  the last half of my life caring for my children. Now that they are older, I was excited to explore and excel in my professional career. My professional background is Healthcare Operations/Revenue Cycle Management. I Have managed Doctor offices, Hospital departments, taught Medical Billing and Coding, etc. This career path began in 1996. However, I needed a change in my career path therefore I started working for a behavioral health software company in about three years ago. Little did I know how this job would impact my life. At first, it was very exciting as I was travelling a lot. This was the  most memorable and exciting aspect of the job. I was able to go to states that I would've never dreamed of traveling to. Unfortunately, to my greatest surprise, there were more projects then the staff to handle. everyone on my team were overloaded with work. The standard was 4 projects at a time. But due to the overload, I was given 6-8 projects back to back. I started overworking myself to meet project deadline. The more I did that the more my health declined. I keep pushing myself more and more because I really liked the implementation and project management aspect of my career path. unfortunately, I became more and more ill and I could no longer meet deadlines. Therefore, I was laid off and had to find another career path with less stress. While recovering from my illness, my financial struggle was real. I nearly lost my home, my car, etc, so thank God for my amazing family and friends that I am able to bounce back.",,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTI2M1
