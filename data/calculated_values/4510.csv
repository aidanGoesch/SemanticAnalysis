We decided to go the back way since it has less traffic and we can avoid the highway since we were pulling the trailer. It was a 2 lane road with a few sharp turns. When we were driving near the one big sharp turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and I thought ""this is awful fast for the SUV to drive like that"". Right about 2 secs after we saw the SUV, it lost control and rolled off the road. IT was horrible because that was my first time saw a real accident like that happened. The SUV rolled into the bushes, and we were the only two people there at the time. We parked the car off the road, called 911 and ran over. The guy passed out, we couldn't really pull him out that easy since the SUV was on the side, so we had to climb to the top of the car and lift to open the door and try to lift him up. Meanwhile there was something in the back of the car that was making the hissing sound, like a gas tank. I was so scared and my friend told me to stay away from the car while he was still trying to get the driver out. Finally after about 5mins, there were some other cars drove by and saw what happened, they stopped and started to help my friend. I went to check on what was making the noise and it was a tank but not has tank. I told the guys who were helping there that to remove the tank first to make sure it is safe. Then I was there try to direct the traffic. Then there was this car drove up, stopped, and a woman ran out of the car and started to scream and cry. She came to me and I held her and she was crying so hard and she was telling me ""I told him he shouldn't be driving"". Then I knew it was someone she knows. I was really sad but I tried to calm her down and I told her that ""he looked ok, he had safety belt on, probably just passed out, he will be fine. Trust me"". I was really calm at the time, I didn't know how did I do that, I guess I was trying to calm her down.  Then later the cops were there, they thanked us, we gave them our contact information in case they need more information about what happened and then we left. Later that day we saw the woman on local news and she thanked us on the news and she wanted us to call her but we never did, we thought we just did what we should do and we don't need anything in return.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB
