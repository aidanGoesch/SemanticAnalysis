They say in life that you live and learn, and nothing can be farther from the truth. I am a single father trying to move ahead in life, and it was time to stop living in an apartment and get an actual house to live and raise my daughter in. A couple months ago, I went looking on the internet trying to find a good deal. I was looking in a suburban area found a decent location next to a large city. It seemed too good to be true and had me ecstatic. After a couple weeks of sending spuratic emails with the land/homeowner, I feel like I had a sort-of good idea of the condition of the house, although my main judgement was based on the pictures posted online. When the day came that I was to move it, I could not be happier. I had my Uhaul ready, and left for my new, possibly wonderful home. When I got there after a 3 hour drive, my expectations died. The house needed new aluminum siding, and the lawn looked sad and dead. My heart sank. I then realized that I got catfished. I pieced together in my mind that the pictures of the house i saw online were several years old. Once going inside, the house stunk. The carpets were dirty and the paint on the walls were all chipped up. The worse part was that there were so many dead bugs in the house. After inspecting the mess, I contacted the previous owner. I was irate and livid and told them all the issues present. They tried to argue, but in the end they agreed to come out and get some work done on it. After about 2 weeks of repairs and touchups, the home I purchased looked so much better. I learned that in the future, I need to do more research before making big decisions.",,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRSW4GBBA
