We were home and bored and it was a beautiful day. I really wanted my kids to get out and explore nature. Little did I know, that we would be exploring nature up close and personal! We were riding on our bikes and scooters and stopped to look at a beautiful red bridge that we had never seen before. My youngest child was a little cranky from all of his riding and didn't really want to look at a bridge. I took some pics of my kids on the bridge and lingered a few seconds longer to take a pic of my older son while my younger son walked off. I could see him edging up to the water. I called down to him to stop but he ignored me and kept on going. Next thing I knew,  I heard a splash and saw he fell in. I was already on my way to him when he fell so I was able to grab him right away. We were both covered in disgusting green algae. Some good samaritans saw us and helped us out of the water. My oldest son was in hysterics. I was beside myself as I was concerned the algae was toxic.  My youngest son was shaken up and not really saying much.  I called the main number to the park and a ranger picked us up with our riding equipment.  We took about 3 showers that night and still smelled.  I washed our clothes many, many times.  I called our pediatrician for advice because I was so worried about the content of the water.  I slept next to my son that night because I was so worried about him.  In the end, everything turned out fine, thankfully,  but my actions and his actions I fell will haunt me forever.",3P4RDNWND6SXR9D7TBY1P0EI880IJT,
