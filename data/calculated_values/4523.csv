From then on though, it has been sparsely used. The reason? uneven weather. It is a yellow Paul Frank themed kite. It deservingly has the Paul Frank monkey stamped on it. It is very, very big, about 45 feet span. It had some counterweight problems in it so we tied some cow spine bones to add stability. Creepy, isnÂ´t it? Still with the bovine vertebrae it behaved like a boomerang! My nephew decided to keep it in our home because it is close to the open space used to fly it. Since then, besides us being busy, there have been alternate periods of very slow winds and heavy rain.  Some other times when weather was fine, my nephew decided to play football instead. Meanwhile the kite remains folded in its glorious silver case, in a corner of our patio. As the year closes, it seems weather will be fine so we can go out and fly the kite again! When that happens, we will likely have more news to write about. So stay tuned!",3P4RDNWND6SXR9D7TBY1P0EI9VLJIQ,
