On a trip out in Tahoe, I rented bikes along with my girlfriend and rode nearly all the way around the entire lake. We started on the North side of the lake, and geared up at the local information center to ensure we had the proper route. After packing up supplies and filling our water bottles, we began our trek in the early hours of the morning. Weaving through paths along one of the most beautiful lakes in the country was a blast, and we often decided to stop and take pictures on our phone to make sure we could soak it all in. We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip. Before we finally pulled back into the lot near our car, we decided to stop for a few minutes on a nearby beach and take in our amazing views of the lake one last time. After numerous pictures and a few final sips from our water bottles we hopped aboard our bikes and rode the final few miles back to where we started. Despite being quite tired from such a long ride that spanned well into the afternoon, we both agreed that this place was an amazing destination that would be worth coming back to. Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car. We have already planned a repeat trip back to the lake, and I know both of us will be counting down the days until we can go back. Next time we will definitely bring our own bikes however!",,3P4RDNWND6SXR9D7TBY1P0EIJRLJIS
