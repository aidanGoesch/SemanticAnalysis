Since I lost my home, the best paying job I have ever had, all of my material items, my family, several friends, my kids temporarily and any thing else I could lose, I found I was starting to lose my self-confidence, my faith and even myself. I lost everything I cared about, was mentally and physically abused, heart-broken, homeless, hungry and lost. This continued on for years with little to no change or progress, no matter what I did or how hard I tried. Feeling the most lonely, sad. tired and hopeless I have ever felt in life, I started to give up.  About a month ago, however, I was shown just how fast life can turn around. I woke up one day that was looking to be just as empty and hopeless as every other day, oh how life is full of surprises! I was randomly blessed with a home after being homeless for years. Someone payed to first few months bills for me, got me moved in and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. My kids will be back home with me soon and I am starting to find myself again! Never give up! It's never too late! And do not ever forget that life can change in a blink of an eye. Keep pushing!",,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTI2M1
