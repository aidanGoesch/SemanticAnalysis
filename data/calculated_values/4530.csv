I picked her out in February but was unable to bring her home with me. My landlord said I absolutely couldn't have a pet so my sister agreed to watch her until I found a place at the end of my lease that would allow her. Finally, last month, I moved and was able to find a place that would allow her. I was so excited to bring her home to live with me finally. The first day was rough. She refused to eat and was throwing up all the water she drank. I was nervous that she was sick. I thought I'd give her some time to see if it was just nerves. The next day she was better and we found a better bathroom routine. She didn't act like she needed to use the bathroom at all the day before. She just sat by the back door waiting to come back in. After about a week, she was eating and had a regular bathroom schedule. About two weeks ago, as we were sitting on the couch next to each other watching TV, I got this warm feeling. I knew then and there that she was meant for my family and it wasn't mistake buying her back in February. I watched her lay there for awhile and smiled thinking about how well she completes our family.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIVBTFLS
