It was her right leg to be exact. She would occasionally brush it off and blame the fact that she was getting older as the cause. This went on for a few months. One morning when she woke up and got out of bed I noticed she was limping. I asked if she was okay and she explained that her leg was hurting worse than ever. I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life. All in all this was a miserable experience.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIW5CLF6
