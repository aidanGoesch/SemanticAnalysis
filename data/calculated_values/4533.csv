I played a lot of sports in my youth and as an adult, I've devoted much of my time coaching little league baseball, as well as participating in bringing new members into the Association.  I was having a great time socializing with the people at my table during breakfast and was looking forward to the awards being given to the winning teams and coaches. After giving a thunderous round of applause for each award recipient, everyone rose and gave a standing ovation.  The chairman of the Association approached the podium yet again. He began speaking about a new award being given this year. After much consideration, they decided to award the person who had worked above and beyond to increase the Association's membership.  As I sat in my chair, I felt so proud that such an important aspect of what makes our Association so successful would be honored today. I was so absorbed in this thought, that I initially paid no attention to my name being called. The person sitting next to me brought me back to the moment by nudging me with his elbow. I looked around to see all eyes in the room on me.  I then heard the Chairman say ""come on up here!"" I stood and felt quite shaken by the surprise at first. As I walked to the stage, I was overwhlemed by the sound of applause and cheering behind me. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. As I approached the podium, I was given a bear hug by the Chairman. He then handed me a gold plaque and I paused to read the inscription. It said ""For your tireless work toward growing the SPYSA, you have been named Youth Sports Association Advocate of the Year, I was truly speechless and took more than a few moment to compose myself before addressing the audience.  ""This was so very unexpected because I don't really think of what I do for this organization in terms of winning or losing. It is about giving each and every person a chance to shine.  It seems that today is my turn to shine and I thank you all from the bottom of my heart.""",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIXSVFLU
