I was at the annual district convention for the service organization that I belong to. It is a full weekend of fun, fellowship, and learning. On Friday we usually just get together and have fun. Saturday is full of activities with seminars, business meetings, and awards. On Saturday morning, we have our awards breakfast before we head into our business meeting directly afterwards.  We had our director there as the keynote speaker of the event. When she finished up her speech, she started handing out awards and recognition for the service many of our members have done. When it was time for her to give the award for membership growth, I was surprised when I heard my name called to come up on stage. I was not expecting it at all and I was so honored to be given this award. Afterwards I found out that a lot of people had known I was going to get this award and had actually nominated me for it. I work extremely hard to get people excited and want to be involved in serving their communities and to be a light in the world. I don't do the work I do for the recognition or awards, but sometimes it is nice to know that others see the effort and time that you put into something and to know that you are making a difference in the world. It made me feel happy and I felt good about myself and the work I do. It is something I am going to remember for a long time.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIXSVFLU
