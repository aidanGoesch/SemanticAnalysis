I spent two days searching for her, checking the road, checking the animal shelters, emailing the shelters. I checked the cars to be sure she was not stuck anyplace. I was super upset that she was missing since a different cat had gone missing before only to find out that one of our neighbors must have taken it. This story is about the misadventures of our missing cat. Then I went outside one evening a few days later and Baby Kitty came stumbling out of the garage. She could not stand up at all and her head was tilted to the side. She seemed to be in a lot of distress about not standing up, so I grabbed the cat carrier and off we went to the Emergency Vet, since of course this happened after the normal vets are closed. The emergency vet is not really very close since we live in a rural area, so it took about a half hour of listening to her cry to get there! I was super upset and worried about her since I did not know what was wrong with her. The vet diagnosed her with Idiopathic Vestibular Disease, which is sort of a catch all for a few possible causes, inflammation in the brain, or inner ear infection or a brain tumor. They said the only way to tell if it was a brain tumor was with an MRI, which they don't really recommend as a first step. They suggested trying antibiotics first to see if there was any improvement and hope that it was not a brain tumor! We got antibiotics and came home. Baby Kitty had to spend a week in our bathroom since she could not walk very well and I was concerned she would fall down the stairs! My oldest son had to give her the medicines twice a day while we were on Vacation too, so I was worried about him doing it right. Baby Kitty is doing much better, still a bit wobbly and has a slight head tilt still, so we will have to bring her back to the vet for a follow up. The most memorable event of this whole incident is we still do not know where Baby Kitty was for three days when she was missing. We also don't know if the disease happened because she was stuck someplace or if she got stuck because she lost the ability to walk somehow. This whole incident was super upsetting because the last time we had to go to the Emergency Vet our dog did not make it.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIYUGLFQ
