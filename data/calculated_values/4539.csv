I am the first owner. It was a new condo community in 2017 in a shore beach rental community. So I assume the idea was to make money on the increase in equity in The hot market back then. I bought it two years ago from the original owner, my dad knew him well. Apparently original owner was a mortgage broker and he and another guy bought 3 units. His main one is the one I bought. His partner(who I don’t see around much) still has a condo. I tried to sell it because I was moving to a new city, and there was many problems with the house. I bought it for 217 2 years ago. When cleaning found some mail that said the dude actually owed over 600 K so maybe he got a seconds mortgage? Anyway, I think he’s still a mortgage broker, hopefully a little wiser. IIt's been a year and it sat empty it deteriorated and the roof leaked so it was cosmetically bad, but no major damage. During the cleanup I found what I guess was a note his daughter wrote to him telling him to cheer up and smile as her and mommy were worried about him stressing out, and that they still loved him. Kind of made me see the other side of this foreclosure mess. had to call lawyers and get it handled, it took a while for them to tell me I couldn't sell it. One other thing was most of the bathroom doors had holes in them like someone punched them. Not sure if it was him or the renters. So, it was kind of sucky to be profiting off someone else’s mistake. But I cant move now, I guess I'm stuck with this as my home for now.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUA8RT2TN
