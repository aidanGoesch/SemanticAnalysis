He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married. This was definitely the most romantic thing my boyfriend has ever done for me.,,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q
