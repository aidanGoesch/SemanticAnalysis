I spent a lot of money fixing it up and making it nice.  I also spent a lot of energy making sure it was presentable and cozy.  I listed it at a fair price, moved, and hoped for the best. Fast forward to almost a year later, and the house still hadn't sold.  I was able to pay the mortgage for a few months, but soon had to stop.  I was still optimistic about selling, but I was getting a little worried. Eventually, foreclosure procedures were started on the property.  I also had to pay utilities and other various taxes and bills.  It was a drain on my money, and reached the point where I was going to be losing money on the sale.  I was still willing to do it, because I wanted to avoid foreclosure. I finally got an offer on the house.  It was just enough that I would be able to afford the payoff I had gotten the month before.  I had to request a new payoff, and came to find that it had jumped $5000 since the last time, because of lawyers fees and escrow advancement. Because of this, at just the moment someone put in a good offer on the house, and I'd be able to sell and avoid foreclosure, the payoff amount jumped far beyond my means.  This left me with no other option than to wait for a foreclosure, and take the hit to my credit. I was greatly disappointed and annoyed, because I'd spent thousands of dollars trying to make the house ready for sale, and was willing to spend thousands more to sell it at a loss, but it all came crashing down because of the worst possible timing.",3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUA8RT2TN,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUA8RT2TN
