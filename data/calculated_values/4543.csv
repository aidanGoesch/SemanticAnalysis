Today I got promoted to assistant manager. when I went in today I was doing my normal things. I walked to my desk and sat down to start my day. As soon as I turned my computer on my boss came into my office . He looked serious. I was afraid that I was getting fired. Instead he told me that Joan was leaving and I was the best candidate for her replacment! He asked me if I would accept the job. Of course I did.  This is so wonderful! I didn't expect to be doing so well this early on in my career! I've only been working there for almost a  year. This puts me so far ahead of my plans of buying my own house. I think in about six months I will be looking for a house. If I save all of my raise I will have enough for a down payment. Hard work pays off.,,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHETT2X
