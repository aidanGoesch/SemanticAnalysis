It was so informative. We learned so much from this event. It produced such a fruitful discussion. We learned how the different poses can relate to your love life. And how sometimes making love is a series of yoga poses itself. I'll never actually use any of the information obtained, but it was valuable. I definitely can pass some of this on to others that I know who are active yogi's. They'll be able to benefit from the information. Some of my friends who were there were able to relate to the discussion. I mostly listened and observed. I met Denise who was one of the people giving a demonstration. I'm excited to say that we have a date tonight and I hope she practices some of those poses with me.  My frineds were really interested in how the love and yoga mix. They stayed aferward to talk more to the master yogi.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAI2UT2B
