I missed my old friends so much, but because of our conflicting schedules, its just too difficult for us to see each other often or talk to each other. Even though I try to call my friends they are just really busy, so I thought I could make some new friends and hopefully become close with them. Over the last 6 months I have been going out more to places where I think meeting friends would be easier. I went to the library, a cafe, a cute little brewery, and to the mall. It was pretty difficult at first to start conversations with strangers, but finally I found someone who I clicked with at the cafe. We both ordered the same coffee and had a common interests around the area. After we talked for a little bit I realized that we could actually be friends. I was able to exchange number with my new friends and we set up weekly coffee friend dates to continue to build our new friendship. Once I built this friendship I was able to actually find more time to call old friends and my new friend. I think dedicating myself to my friends more has helped me so much. I feel so much better about myself and have really enjoyed myself lately. I dont miss my friends as much as I used to and we have built new memories together. I think this was one the best decision I have come up with in the last year. I will continue to work on myself when it comes to my friends!",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAJ3P2TI
