We had been flirting and talking for a few weeks prior to that and it was nice. We decided to finally meet, it was nice. We went to IHOP for a nice brunch and to finally see each other in person. I enjoyed seeing her in person and knew it was real then. We sat down and had a nice talk with each other, gazing into each others eyes. It was right then and there I knew she was the one. Some people think that is probably creepy, but I knew. I have evidence to show it because we are married with a kid already. This was so awesome to think about and continue to right. I am one proud husband and father now. It all goes back to that day when I met the one. The one who set me straight and on the right path. The one who I forever get to hold. I really like thinking and writing about that day.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUASZRT2C
