It was my very first trip. My two sisters, brother in law, and my boyfriend. Our first stop was at Magic Kingdom, at night they pop fire works and well my boyfriend proposed!. It was literally the most amazing day of my life. I wasn't expecting it and that made it ten times better. I couldn't believe he was able to keep it a secret and surprised me in such a memorable way. I think it took him a lot of planning. But he did great. The ring was perfect and he even had the right size. He had shirts made for us that said best day ever. Which it really was the best day ever. I wouldn't change anything for the world. Now we are planning our wedding. He has been such a big help. Disney world is now my favorite place to go on vacation. For our Honey moon we will definitely be going to Disney world again.",32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q
