I could not find Joshua. We went to this protest together as I convinced him to come with me.  They were dragging people and arresting them. I was afraid of Joshua being taken. I shouted as loud as I could calling him. I did not hear any response. I am getting anxious and angry. I'm sure these police officers have been paid off by the giant corporation we're protesting against today. They're evil, anti-planet monsters. The air that we breathe and the water that we drink is being polluted by them. I saw Joshua much later that day. He was tear-gassed and I apologized to him. He was also angry. Not to me, but to the giant corporation. He said that if he died that day it would all be for the Sunrise Movement. He said that four weeks ago. He died today for the cause.",,3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT22C7GR
