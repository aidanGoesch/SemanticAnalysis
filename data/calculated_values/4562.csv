She is only 2 years old. Both me and my husband work jobs. I would prefer to stay at home with my daughter. But we wouldn't make enough money to make ends meet if I didn't work. I got a call the other day from my daycare provider. They said they are closing themselves down in just two weeks. I don't know what I'm going to do. I can't quit my job. I would prefer to be able to just watch my daughter myself. I don't have very much family. The family I do have that is local also works so that cannot watch my daughter either. This has become a big stress. I don't know what we're going to do moving forward. I wish my life was a bit easier. There is always some problem in my way.,,3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT3NPG7K
