This is the time i thought i will have somebody for the rest of my life. But this time i was wrong because apart from all i had planned everything surprised me to death. After giving everybody a 3 moths notice of my  wedding day. I prepared everything as normal and called my wife to be to tell her the progress. That was well and super but for the first time she dint pick up the phone rather somebody else did. This was every shocking to me though i had to listen. Surprisingly  it was his brother i relaxed for a minute. Ok then what was he doing with her phone at that time when she was supposed to have it. I dint even believe what he told me. I had to figure out what and could it be happening right now. As a normal human i thought of the best to take care of my self before i had to react to the message. Then i came to realize that no matter how hurting the information you receive is take it easy an react later it will be well with you. But that's what i thought was good at the time i received the message. What if i had reacted immediately maybe i could have saved a life. Since then i decided no more chill pills.,,3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWTDRZ7G3
