I found this a little odd, since I'm a man and bridesmaids are usually women, but I decided to do it anyway to be a good friend. So, I went and got fitted for a dress like any other bridesmaid. The day of the wedding, I put on the dress and had my makeup done. I looked a lot like a drag queen, but if my friend wants a drag queen at her wedding, then that's what she'll get! The ceremony itself was very beautiful. People were a bit confused about why I was wearing a dress, but they adjusted after a bit and everything went smoothly. I now have a bridesmaid dress hanging in my closet. Not sure what I'll ever use that for again, though I might not need to get a Halloween costume this year. The experience of wearing the dress was not as bad as I thought. It was relatively comfortable. However, it was the high heels and bra that were the worst. These were very restrictive and somewhat painful. I have some blisters from the heels and the bra dug into my back. Also, I was a bit disappointed to find I was only an A cup. I'm not sure why this was disappointing, I just guessed it would've been higher.",,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K
