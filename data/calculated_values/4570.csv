She has been my friend since we were four years old, so this wedding meant a lot to me. First, I got to meet a lot of her family and friends that I had never met before. I live six hours from her now so it was wonderful to catch up with her. We spent the first night eating dinner together and we had the best time. I loved getting to know her friends and her fiance better. The next day we spent most of the day getting ready for the wedding. We went and got our nails done. We went to lunch together. We went to the church and began setting up for the wedding. The day of the wedding we went to the church early so that we could get ready and relax as well. We had so much fun watching each other get our hair and makeup done. When it was time for the actual wedding we got a lot of great pictures. We told a lot of jokes to try to keep our nerves calm! The actual wedding was beautiful. Everything went smoothly and not one thing went wrong. After the wedding we had a beautiful reception with great food, a picture booth, and lots of great friends getting to chat. It was one of the best events I have been to in a long time. This story is significant to me because my friend has risen above her circumstances to find happiness, and I love that.",3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K
