I was so worried that she had drowned in the water for a few minutes. Seeing her on the shore really helped me calm down. I was so glad to see her there. I was so nervous that she wasn't going to be alive. It was one of the worst panics of my life. The way I felt was pure terror in my soul. I never felt like that. I was shaking at the thought. Her little body on the bottom of the lake cold, lifeless, dead. I was so sad because my thoughts were racing. They raced to the bottom of that lake with her baby body just dead. My baby girl gone forever. We would have to go bury here and get a baby gravestone, in a baby graveyard. I t was so terrifying. But the relief that she was just on the shore was such a relief. I'm so glad it's over.",,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLWV6HP
