It was sunny and warm. We found a spot kept our things and took our floaties and entered into the lake. I was with my son and my daughter was right with me and my husband. I and my friends were all chatting and meanwhile, I was thinking my husband was taking care of my daughter and my husband thought that I am keeping an eye on her. Just within minutes, I noticed that my daughter was not there. All bad thoughts flashed in front of me. I was shivering. I started shouting and my husband was also panicked. My friends started looking for her in water. Suddenly I noticed on the shore that my daughter was playing in the sand. I took a deep breath and informed everyone. I told her not to leave anywhere without letting meÂ know. That was a lesson for me and I promised myself to be more careful hereafter. That's how our picnic trip became a panic trip.",3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLWV6HP,
