I knew I would have to go to work but I wanted to stay at home and drink hot chocolate while watching Netflix. It was nearly 7:30 and I decided to get on my was to work. I had bundled up so that I knew I would be warm enough. I decided to make the best of the weather and make the brisk walk to work that day. It was not to  far into my walk when I finally hit the main street I came across a man that I had seen before but I had never really talked to. He was a homeless guy that I would see rummaging every now and then in the garbage. On this day, he happened to be in my path and I just happened to ask him if he was okay. I guess he must have felt something because he immediately began to cry and pour out his heart about his condition. I could feel he needed someone so I sat and listened to him for a while. I could tell it really helped him to get through that moment. It was really fulfilling for me too. I was able to help someone that really needed me. I wanted to tell him that he could come talk to me anytime, but he ran off too fast. It was nevertheless memorable to me.",32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIPY32MX,
