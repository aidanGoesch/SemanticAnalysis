It was Josh's dream for a long time. Ever since our engagement, i knew that i had to gift him something special. And what more special gift is there for Josh than the All-star game? It was months in planning, and we got to New York 7 weeks ago, the day before the game. I was feeling a bit low through the flight. I kinda felt something was wrong with me. But i couldn't disappoint Josh. I garnered all my strength and went to the game with him. And then i puked, right as we entered the stadium. Josh insisted to come back with me to the hotel. I couldn't let him. I knew how much he wanted to see the game. It was such a shame to miss the game. However, i did manage to get some memorabilia from the game for Josh. I didn't know it had logo for the all-star game, that was a pleasant surprise. Josh was over the moon over it!",,3PEIJLRY6UFGNO21ZWHHH0V5YJDWX6
