They specifically wanted to go to Ireland, but we also decided to visit several other countries including Spain. I usually take my kids on one vacation every year, but I never would have dreamed of going to a place like Europe with them when they were younger. Now that they're a little older, I thought I would try to make it happen. We were really excited when we got on the plane two weeks ago, but the trip wasn't nearly long enough. We stayed for 10 days. The children have Irish ancestry from their father's side of the family, so they had a blast in Dublin. I wanted to go to Tenerife, Spain, and I think that the children had an even better time there.  Our favorite place we visited was a beach in Italy that sat on the Mediterranean. The children had never before seen a beach that had sea glass instead of sand. They spent hours just picking up sea glass and looking at it. The weather was absolutely perfect, but it was not warm enough to actually swim. We shared so many amazing memories with one another on the trip back home over the Atlantic. I know this was a trip of a lifetime, but I would love to be able to go back. My children will be thinking about this trip for the rest of their lives. Hopefully, when they're a little older, we can go back again and relive our dream vacation.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG016WZS
