This was grad school, so many days of effort were involved. She got her Phd. It was quite large too. We had presentations and cakes. Awards were given out. We even had special appearances by several friends from the past. Everyone seemed to have a great time. We laughed all night. She even met up with several people she hadn't seen in years. She was happy people cared and took the time. It was exciting to see her notice the effort and time we took. She was in tears at first. It was unexpected for her. But she had a great day that she will never forget.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG5D5WZK
