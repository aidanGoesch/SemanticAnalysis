She will be graduating in December with PH. D. in Urban Youth Development. To be a black woman of her age, with a full time job and a busy life ,graduating with a PH. D is amazing. Though it was no easy road and she admitted to all of us many times that she wanted to give up, she didn't. She kept pushing, sometimes missing nights of sleep and fun times to obtain a major accomplishment. She was convinced that the party was actually to celebrate the life of her stepfather, since he is old and not sure of how much time he had left to spend with his family. To her surprise, she drove an hour and a half away to be celebrated for her own accomplishments. The look on her face when she walked through the door with her cousin and heard everyone yell, ""SURPRISE!,"" was priceless. She broke down into tears of joy and was greeted by my two year old son who ran to her with open arms. She was greeted with hugs, cheers of congratulations. The program led celebration also consisted of opening and closing statements from family, friends, professors and a surprise facetime call from a classmate that was amplified on the microphone for everyone to hear. One her professors boasted about how she was the most quiet person in her class but one of the smartest.   My mother in law had her own photo backdrop with her name and school logo on it, a custom cake with her school's name, colors, mascot, and a graduation cap and degree. We also presented her with two custom made glass awards. We all ate, danced, cried, and had a good time in celebration of her achievements. She and I have come a long way in our relationship so for me to able to contribute in doing this for her and seeing the joy on her face made me fell good. It was an emotional  experience for us all.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG5D5WZK
