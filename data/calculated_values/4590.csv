I am still reeling over what happened between us - or rather - what crap he decided to pull.  Mind you, we were together for what - 4 years?  I was honestly expecting a ring this year for Christmas.  Needless to say from the start of my entry, that is not what happened at all.   In all our years, this was the first time he took me home with him for the holidays.  We usually went to my family events because his parents usually traveled to Peru for the holidays.  Since his grandmother had passed, they had no reason to go this year. and his mother made all kinds of elaborate plans that would span 5 days.  He must have asked me a thousand times if I wanted to go or not, or if I would be comfortable with all of his family speaking Spanish.  I am fluent - he knows this.  But, I thought he was just being considerate seeing that I am the only white person coming - the only person who does not have Hispanic roots, period. I assured him that I was fine, and I would be prepared for a bit of a cold shoulder coming at me.  I was tougher than I looked.  We arrived at his parents home on the 23rd of December.  The house was brightly decorated inside and out, and it smelled of cooking  - you know how it smells when there are several types of food layered on top of another - but it just smells like home?  Yes, like that.  Everyone was incredibly gracious and kind, and I made a good impression by helping with cooking, clean up, set up and just having general conversation with his family - even his allegedly racist great uncle. Oddly enough, Devan seemed angry that they were warming up to me so well, making snide comments like they liked me more than him, etc.  Often, I found myself alone with his family members while he was no where to be found, or off in a corner messing with his phone.   We left on the 28th, and had plans for a bug NYE party in the city - tickets I had paid $400 for.  He called me on NYE at 8pm (and hour AFTER he was suppose to meet me) and said that he had taken me to his family's home to see if he could get their approval before marrying me.  He SAID they were only being polite and that NO ONE actually liked me, and he was sorry, but he just couldn't be with someone that they did not approve of.  I must have cried for a week, but eventually I began to feel that he was lying because there was no way I could have misinterpreted the situation that badly for 5 whole days.  I called his mother to ask if I had left my Hermes scarf there (I knew I hadn't) and she talked my ear off for over an hour, and said how she couldn't wait until Easter so we could be together again, and that she had told Devan she couldn't wait to have a new daughter - that lying imp used his family as an excuse!",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG5EZZWJ
