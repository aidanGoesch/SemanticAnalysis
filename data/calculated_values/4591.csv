I used to go for jogging in the morning. There I was seriously watching my Ex with the old memories, only watching with curiosity nit with any intentions. Thinking about the promises that we had made with each other. The one of the most important promises is that we will never ever leave each other and have to stay forever with the memories. Suddenly, one day we meet each other and she asked me to speak about our life. I too eagerly hearing the words from her. She suddenly said that lets break-up. I was in shock that time. No other thing comes to my mind for her responses, she tells her difficulties in her home and by explaining this she left me with her reasons. After ten days again I gone for jogging. There she is waiting for me in my place. She runs fast and had a tight hug and apologised her for her misbehavior. She tells me that she had made a game play that she acts like leaving me and gone out of my life. But in the serious life that game doesn't exists. So, our love own the game.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG5EZZWJ
