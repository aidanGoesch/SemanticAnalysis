I can't even believe it. I called mom today and she broke the news to me. Aunt becky is no more! How can this be? I have very fond memories of her around my childhood. I remember she was really kind to me. She always got me gifts. The purple dress was the most surprising gift of all. I had grown apart from her since my 9th birthday. However, she still held a special place in my heart. It is really hard to believe and digest her absence on this planet. I hope she is at a better place now. She should be, considering how great a person she was. I wish and pray for her soul to rest in peace.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG6HAWZY
