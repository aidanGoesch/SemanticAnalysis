My mom was with me and she looked shocked.  I don't know why but I started bawling.  I came to the States when I was eight so it didn't make sense that it was impacting me this much.  It is not like an aunt that I meet regularly or talk to regularly.  For days prior to the event I felt my heart was aching.  I wasn't sleeping well and my heart was literally aching.  Maybe I'm just a sensitive person and can feel other's pain.  If that is the case, I'm not sure if I like it.  I called them back to talk to my cousins in Korea.  I was crying more than them.  It just doesn't make any sense.  They were trying to comfort me rather that the other way around.  I felt embarrassed.  Am I a cry baby?  I'm not always this way...maybe I should got the the doctor...a psychiatrist.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG6HAWZY
