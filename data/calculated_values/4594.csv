They said that they were able to supply a job opportunity. Among the other jobs that I had applied for I had suspicions that this one was not all that they said they would be. The site directed me to places that were allowing me to create an account with most of my important information attached. So,I decided to give it a chance to see if I could make any money.                               The next day,I received an email from them with a code in it. They said the code was to verify my information that I had submitted. I copied the code and went to the link that they supplied. I pasted the code in their submission box and a message suddenly popped up saying that my account had been suspended. They said that too many attempts had been made to confirm my information and for security seasons they were temporarily suspending my account. I was unable to login to my account so I sent them an email asking what they could do to assist me. They ignored my email and sent money to one of my accounts that they said they were going to use for verification and it was something that was merely attached to the payment method that I submitted for them to pay me.                      At that point they did not respond and I was left in the dark about how I was going to be able to get to my information. I was also left to wander what they would do with my information while they had me blocked out of it. The fact that they blocked me out so quickly over a code that they sent me made me suspicious of foul play and caused me to feel uneasy. Soon after,when the block was lifted and I was able to gain entry into the account I quickly deleted the account. Later,I was able to change my password on a few things and I think things are better now.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG86DZWK
