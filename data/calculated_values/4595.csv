I sometimes do freelance work that's available through Amazon, and sometimes apply to individual jobs via different job-posting sites. On one such posting, I applied to a job for data entry. The employer was  verified by the site, and had many others applying for the same job. Not long after I posted, I was contacted by someone who claimed to work for the company. They pressured me into quickly acquiescing to an interview over Google Hangouts. Although it was suspiciously sudden, the constant pressuring that the person gave made me quickly decide that it was worth taking the chance, rather than losing an opportunity. As I spoke to the interviewer, I was alarmed by their poor grammar, but their explanation of being a foreign company gave me some hope. However, it was their offered benefits that disillusioned me. They were offering to pay me more than twice what I applied for. Although they explained that I would have more responsibilities than I applied for, it still seemed too good to be true.  I decided to use a break in the conversation to look up the company. The first relevant hit warned me to immediately walk away, and that I was in the middle of a practiced scam. I immediately ceased conversation with all people involved, blocked them, and deleted what personal information I could. I now know to personally vet whatever company I work with, and I've researched some of the more tell-tale signs and predictable plots. Although I was very angry at the aftermath, I've been able to learn from the experience and better myself.",3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG86DZWK,
