I often think about what I did to end up in prison and have to stop myself. Thinking about the past will not change it. I have to move forward. Being released from prison was the best feeling I have ever experienced. To walk out and see my parents waiting. They loved me. They didn't hate me like I had imagined they would. I was free. It had been a long time since I'd been able to do whatever I wanted. I could run down the road. I could stare at the sun. I could stop and get a milkshake. I remember just listening to every sound like I'd never heard before in my life. Every car driving past was amazing. Every bird chirping was mind blowing. I hope I never forget that feeling. I hope I never take freedom for granted again.,,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBGZ7MWZJ
