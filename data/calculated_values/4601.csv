I was one of those guys you could never see settling down in college, even high school for that matter. I was a mans man who always wanted to go out, meet new people, meet new women. Settling down was something that really never crossed my mind. It wasnt until after college where I met my beautiful wife. She put up with the bro aspect of me, and was there for the gradual change from being a party enthusiast, to a more refined human being. Then marriage happened. Again, this was something that was pretty much unheard of in my group of freinds considering the type of person that I was and the kind of guy I always behaved like. It was even said in my best man speech that me getting married was surprising when one would have guessed that pigs would fly first. Getting pregnant was pretty much the next step. My wife, being a little older, wanted to knock kids out of the way as soon as possible since the older you get the more chances of complications. That being said, it was off to the races whether I was ready or not. It took a while to get pregnant with nobody but to blame but the both of us, but me being me, i blamed her of course. I was terrified of having a child, although I knew we both were. I went to every checkup and doctors appointment with her. I knew she was ready and self assured, but I think I did it for myself as well to give myself my own reassurance. With my lack of patience and my strong focus on saving and fiscal responsibility, it was a tough thing to try to get used to. All the way of course my wife is reassuring me that everything is going to be amazing and its going to go well. The nervousness pretty much all went away the morning that my daughter was born. My heart melted the moment I held her and I finally felt for the first time, that i knew I could do this whole father thing. It's no joke that they say your entire life changes the moment you have a kid, but in this case, I think its for the best.",,3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIDZ6JJ3
