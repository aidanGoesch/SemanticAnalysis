It was his birthday and he was sent a check, a sizable one at that.  Using it we were able to pay off a debt we had, a loan.  It was a relief and a unexpected happening to see that burden gone.  The check came right out of the blue, difficult to believe, in fact we didn't believe it at first.   I thought my husband was joking.   But he wasn't and it was not an error, the money was ours.  It made us so happy to finally own our own home.  It feels like we have made great progress in our life, and even though the money was unearned we are proud to be where we are now.  These past few weeks we have had such a great feeling, it's a goal of so many people and we are there.  I'm not sure why they did this for us, but the God's were smiling on us that day.  I'm sure my husband has never had such an unexpected gift as that before, and it feels as much mine as his.  I sometimes wonder if there is some unexpected down side to what just happened, I feel undeserving.  I hope there is nothing in our future to balance this out.  I really don't mind what I get for my birthday's going forward, this is enough and I'm so grateful.",,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JT6KW19L
