My dog and best friend Indy passed away. She was with me day and night for 12 years. I think I will miss her forever. She had such a big personality one of those unique characters. Indy had problems with her eyesight she couldn't tell what was what when it was far away. She ones saw a woman pulling a suitcase and thought it was a dog or animal on a leash. She barked and went crazy over seeing a suitcase being pulled along the street. Our family always laughs about that. She also saw a huge painting of a man on the wall of a store in town. She thought he was real and barked and barked. Her hair was raised up on her back and she didn't stop till we drove away. Indy was part Lab and part german shorthair. She had a short tail that had been cropped by who ever had her as a puppy. She was a rescue dog. We buried our beloved Indy in the backyard in the garden. She spent a lot of time out there with me. I planted wildflowers over her grave. We placed a big rock with her name printed on it to mark her grave. I still talk to her when I am in the garden. I will miss that dog till the day I die.,,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTU87914
