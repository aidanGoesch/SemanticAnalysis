We've decided to move out of state to start a new life elsewhere.  We're just not happy with where we are currently.  We want to get out of the cold and enjoy a better environment.  I feel depressed here.  Unfortunately my family was upset about this.  They don't want us to leave.  I understand why, they love us, and they'll miss us.  But it's 2019, and there's plenty of ways that we can stay in touch.  We can still talk to each other on facebook and through text messages and stuff.  We don't even see each other much anyways, so it's not like us moving will be a big change in how my family and us interact.  Even though they're not happy with our decision to move, it's going to be a final decision.  We've come to terms with what we're doing.  We've decided that this is the best decision for us.  Although we'll see my family less, we'll still be able to keep in touch, and I'm sure I'll still visit them and they'll visit us. So, goodbye to Illinois, and hello to Florida!",,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTWOV91Q
