I was 21 years old then, after that my dad brung me, my two younger brothers and two sisters were still in school. I was just going into college and was misbehaving at a lot. I just didn’t care, had very poor performance and I got excluded a lot and when I was turning 23 I got kicked out of school for good; so then all I did was sit about the house all day ‘til my friends graduates. I started drinking and smoking hash nearly every day. I pushed drugs to earn a living. Then when I got a bit older, about 24/25, I started taking ecto’s (ecstacy) and coke, only really when I was drinking and mostly at the weekends. Then one day somebody asked me and my friend if we wanted to try smack! At first we were saying no, I hated that stuff, I had seen what it had done to people. Then we both decided we would try it, just once, and never again. So we took it. We had a good few hits each and it took all our worries, all the bad stuff that had happened in our pasts, away. So we started taking it every day. One day I woke up and felt really ill. My stomach was in so much pain, I had cramps and my legs were sore when I would be sitting. I was always fidgeting, I couldn’t stay still. My bones were aching, I thought I had the flu. My nose kept running and one minute I would be cold, 2 minutes later I’d be really hot. That’s when I realised I never had the flu, I was rattling. I had £10, so I went and got a bag of smack. I started smoking it, and straight away I felt normal again. It was like I needed smack to feel normal again ‘cos I had a habit now. I started pushing drugs and coke till I got arrested for itI was in prison for 2years and turned a new leaf in there and on the day i was released my friends and family waited for me and when I say them I knew how importand friendship was and how it was a good thing to have integrity.",,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A
