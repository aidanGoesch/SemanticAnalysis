I experienced an overwhelming amount of excitement and gratefulness both to them and in general, which was difficult for me to control. Attendant emotions post-prison release are overwhelming with a significant amount of anxiety attached. I curbed my desire to be impulsive and let them guide me. We bought a few necessities then I treated them to a meal, then they drove me to a bus station. Leaving was tough, and Garth was about to cry, and I'll never forget this. I am in continued contact with him and he has flown to Charlotte for a week long visit, and will again soon. On the 16 hour bus trip I tried to read, but my mind and emotions were active and in shock of my new freedom. Mostly I looked out the window and thought about my future, my recent past, and my new opportunities. A Chicago transfer was my favorite part - I love Chicago architecture - but after the 3 hours of Chicago area traffic the ride became mostly rural. Once hitting West Virginia, the mountains inspired awe and appreciation in me. I had been most looking forward to this part of the trip, with beautiful hills for several hours. The temperature by the time I hit Charlotte was 40 degrees warmer than it had been in Milwaukee, astonishingly. Charlotte was a pleasant sight with nice architecture, and it now hit me that this would be my home for a couple of years. I was apprehensive yet thrilled, and dedicated to never repeating prison!",3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A,
