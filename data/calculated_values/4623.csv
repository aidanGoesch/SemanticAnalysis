This was the second time I'd been sentenced to prison time, and hopefully the last! It was a bitter experience, but my day of release was liberating - pun intended - to say the least! I was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months due to an altercation I had with a Milwaukee police officer. I was extremely inebriated during the altercation - from a consecutive days of high DXM abuse - and barely recall any of it. Having been convicted of a same or similar charge in 2013 under identical circumstances, I knew upon sobering up that prison time was guaranteed. It was an awful experience, especially in the beginning. In short, I spent 5 months between the County Jail and the House of Corrections, then a few months in an intake prison, followed by about 6 months at a medium security location, and, finally, the remainder in Racine, where I completed the Earned Release Program to save myself about 9 months of incarceration. My release was exciting, though. G and R picked me up, we went to a dollar store, then to their house to eat and relax. It was endearing and pleasant; they are great friends. This experience has taught me about friendship and integrity, and I feel as though I've become a much better - and more complete - person, as a result. The bus ride from Milwaukee to Charlotte followed; I'd been looking forward to it for over two years! Chicago was my favorite stop, of course, but the mountains in West Virginia and Tennessee are beautiful. It was a long but relaxing bus ride, and this time around I knew that I didn't need to use drugs, as I'd felt in the past. I was allowed to stay sober and to enjoy the experience for what my brain found it to be under normal circumstances.",3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A
