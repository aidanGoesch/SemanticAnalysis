He knew I was feeling stressed out and haven't had a break from work in quite awhile. It was a complete surprise, he called me out of the blue after having flowers delivered to my work. He picked me up in his truck. He'd gotten our hotel room, planned the trip, and drove the entire way. It was like a mini-vacation that I really needed but couldn't have asked for. We made a fire on the beach, went to some local bars. We made a ""no Yelp"" rule and agreed that instead of searching online for where to eat or hangout we instead just went exploring every day. We took a small fishing trip the first day out of the blue. We got a bit tipsy during the boat ride back and called a cab to get a bite to eat at a local restaurant. After that we went on a small bar crawl and went back to our room. The next day we rented Vespa's and rode into the city. We had a take out lunch pic-nick near a skatepark. Went swimming, then had dinner at an upscale restaurant he'd booked a few days prior. I had a bit too much wine, he didn't drink the rest of the night and became my DD.",,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6106L897
