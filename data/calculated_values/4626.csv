However, to make things worse she had just gotten cheated on and really didn't want to do it. I told her it'll help her get her mind off things with the ex. She decided to come shopping and we went to a few places and tried on dresses. We found a few cute dresses, but it was obvious that my friend wasn't in the mood for any of this. We decided to take a break from shopping and sit down and just talk. She talked about being cheated on and how men are scum. A lady walking by overheard us talking and stopped and chatted with us. I told her to ignore my friend, she was just cheated on. The lady was really nice about the whole thing and we told her that we were getting dresses to wear at our friend's wedding. The lady told her that she was sure that the man that our friend was marrying wasn't a bad guy like the one that cheated on my friend. She also mentioned that it would be rude to no go or to not take this seriously. I agreed with her and  she ended up talking some sense into my friend. She also told us about a dress shop that has great dressed in the mall. So we went and found some dresses we really liked. We told the clerk that someone mentioned to come here and it ended up being the woman who owned the store was the one that helped us! She let us have the dresses for free!",3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH613RX89S,
