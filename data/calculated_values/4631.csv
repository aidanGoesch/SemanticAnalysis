About 9-10 month ago I had to move to another state. I was transferred because they shut down the building I was working in before. I was very sad and afraid about my future. I was worried that I might get fired too. It was a relief when I found out that I can be transferred to Austin. They have a huge division of my company there. I was relieved because one of my best friends lives there. I visited her in Austin few times before but I still didn't know the city that well. I didn't know where is a good place to rent an apartment.  Well I didn't even know where my company was located. My girlfriend was amazing. She did her own research and helped me tremendously. She helped me with my move too. She opened her house door to me for some time until I found a place to live. It took me a while to get my car there so she was driving me around and let me use her car from time to time. She was amazing and I don't know what I would of done without her.,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6197J98H,
