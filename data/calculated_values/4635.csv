We flew from Dulles Airport in Virginia to Charles de Gaule airport in France, located just outside Paris. From the airport we took a taxi to our hotel, which was right in the middle of the city. Immediately, I knew that I was in a special place. The people in France were so much more open and kind to me than I had ever expected. As an American, there is a pervasive stereotype that the French are all mean and rude and nasty. This couldn't be further from the truth. In fact, the vast majority of Parisians that I interacted with were wonderful people. I found that as long as you are respectful towards them, they treat you with just as much respect back. Another thing I noticed about French people was that they are much more open to you if you try and speak a little French. I think that this shows them that you are trying to learn their culture, rather than forcing them to speak English. After our trip to France, we flew to Italy. My experience there was very similar to my experience in France. The people were wonderful and much more kind than I was expecting. On the whole, this experience changed my outlook on life. I no longer believe the callous stereotypes that infiltrate American culture. It seems to me that people all around the world are willing to go the extra mile if you show them basic decency and respect.",,3PM8NZGV8Z2B3R6FNNIBPBDJB4DQXM
