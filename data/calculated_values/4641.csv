I remember where I was when I heard the news.  I was sitting in my office catching up on some email when my wife walked in and told me. Our son was very upset when he came home and he said it's because the teacher told them that his classmate and friend will be going to heaven soon. My heart went out for the family. I felt horrible and even more horrible for my son that he'd have to learn about life and death so young. It broke my heart to think of that child, his parents and his extended family. Life can be so cruel. Life can be random, without any particular rhyme or reason. I prayed to a God I barely believed in and figured out how I'd talk to my son. I wish innocence can stay with a child longer, but today my son learned a valuable lesson about life and cherishing the moments we are here because at any time tragedy could strike. I had to figure out a plan of action. How to talk to my son and make sure that he could learn to cope with the tragedy. In the end I settled on letting him know that the best course of action was to just enjoy the time left with his friend. Let them know that they are there for them and will always think of them. Just be a darn good friend and love the memories he has with them.",,3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KAIL9CJ
