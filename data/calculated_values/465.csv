While it was difficult to be too surprised at this result, he had seemed to be doing well and living a good life, and the hope was that he was on the road to recovery. Unfortunately this was not to be the case.   One thing that both me and my dad as well as him and his dad had in common was our love of golf.  It was something that we often did together and had taken numerous golfing vacations together.  These trips had become a highlight of the year for all involved and something to look forward too.  My dad works for a healthcare company that specializes in cancer treatments and as long as he has been working there we had played in a golf tournament that helps to sponsor families that are fighting cancer and does such things as send kids to a summer camp or pay for a day at an amusement park.  Something that will allow the family to enjoy their time together and get away from the fight against cancer for awhile and feel like a normal family.  There is one hole that is called the dedication hole.  It is where you write a name down of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life and every member of the group tees off at the same time.  When we pulled up to the tee box my friend got very emotional and began to cry.  Looking back it makes complete sense that he would feel this way, but I just hadn't thought of it as he is someone who almost always keeps his emotions close to his chest.  In turn the rest of the group became emotional as we have all been friends for more than 15 years.  We all wrote down his dad's name on our balls and gave them to him after the round.  While the whole day was fun and we all had a blast at this moment we all felt the gravity of what our friend had gone through and it made us closer as a group.",32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP7SROHR,
