The kids loved swimming so it was only natural for us to decide to go to Myrtle Beach. We asked the kids what they would think about taking a trip down to Myrtle Beach and needless to say they were ecstatic. We hadn't had time to go on any type of vacation since my husband and I work fulltime jobs trying to pay off our mortgage. Well, we decided to go on a Friday morning so we took that Friday off of work. We headed down and it took us about 2 hours by car. The car ride there was actually pretty relaxing to say the least. The kids were busy on their iPads and I just enjoyed the scenery while my husband drove. When we got there, we checked into the hotel and the check in was seamless. We were pretty hungry after settling into the room so we decided to eat at the restaurant inside the hotel. The restaurant was busy but this didn't take away from our experience. The food was delicious. I decided on a fettuccine Alfredo, my husband a steak and the kids a burger each. After, the kids got ready to go into the pool for a bit before sundown. My husband had a few beers while I just had a margarita and the kids had so much fun at the pool. The next day, we decided to go to the beach.
