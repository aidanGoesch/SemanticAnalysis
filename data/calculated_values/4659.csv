She was young only 24, and she had brain cancer. It was sudden, and spread fast. One weekend she got married to her fiance. I wasn't there, but saw pictures, and she was clearly very sick. The following Thursday, I got a text from my partner. She had died.  I dropped my phone. I was at work where I am a substitute teacher. That day I was working in room full of 4th graders who gave me a lot of trouble. I knew them well, but they were always getting in trouble. When I dropped my phone everything stopped. Suddenly they became very concerned and asked me what was wrong.  It took me a few minutes to be able to say anything. When I finally could all I could say was ""My friend died"". One of the kids,  I think it was a boy who was particularly a bother, went and got one of the security gaurds. He covered for me until I was okay enough to come back into the room.",3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KZY4C9Q,3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KZY4C9Q
