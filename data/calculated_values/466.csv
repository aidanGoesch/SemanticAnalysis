It isn't so much of a research and looking to beat the disease as it is to help families lead some kind of a normal life and allows children to do things like attend camps and parents to have such things that are taken for granted like ""date nights"".  I played with three of my good friends who I have known since high school.  One of my friends recently lost his dad to cancer.  I was very close to his dad and remain close to his entire family.  It was a very hard time that he went though as well as the rest of the family.  Truthfully I struggled with it as well as, although he had been fighting cancer for 20 years, the end came pretty quick.  At this tournament there was one hole that is called the dedication hole.  On this hole every person is given a new golf ball where they write the name of someone who has been effected by cancer in your life.  Without being prompted all of us put down my friends dad's name.  It was at this point that my friend and I both became very emotional.  This is a tournament that both of us have played in for a number of years, but even so I didn't foresee the level of emotions that we would have at this point.  I think that this will be something that will stick with both of us for a long time.  I saw his mother recently and she mentioned that it really meant a lot to her son and he had mentioned it a number of times to her and other family members how touched he was.  It will remain something that I will hold near and dear to my heart for a long time.",32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP7SROHR,32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP7SROHR
