But I couldn't think of where I had seen his face before. Then it came to me. That was a guy I knew from high school. He looked a lot different because for one thing, I had not seen him in years. Secondly he looked kind of drugged out. As he was put into the back of the cop car I heard someone call my name. I knew that voice! It was Amber, but she sounded worried. Turns out her car had been hit. She looked okay as she ran up to me at least. I asked her what had happened. She told me that she had been at the night club up the road, when this  guy started harassing her. She didn't want to deal with it anymore so she left. Well the guy who I just saw getting arrested was the guy from the club. Turns out he was following her. He signaled for her to pull over and when she refused he rammed into her car and caused a pretty bad accident. Amber was just glad to see me because she was pretty shaken up. I took her back to my house so she can hang out and relax. The next day I helped her file papers to get a restraining order on the guy from the club.",,3PPTZCWALR608M6UO56WMWTUC0PZQR
