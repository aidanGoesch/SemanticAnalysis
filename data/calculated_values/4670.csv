This is the first time where she is doing a majority of her school tasks by herself. She rides the bus, brings her own lunch, and gathers her backpack with belongings to bring home. What surprises us the most is how mature and excited she is about the entire thing! It makes us happy because my wife and I both remember dreading school in our early years. Fortunately she has been very social since preschool and is always looking forward to the next day with all of her friends and teachers. Also, unlike her parents, she is a morning person and is usually the first one awake asking to get ready to go to school. Her friends also seem to enjoy school as much as she does so that probably helps with her attitude. Just after the first week of school we are noticing improvements in several areas. She has been typically stubborn with reading every night, but she has been doing better at sounding out words. She also seems more motivated to write and practice her numbers and math. Her teachers have told us they believe she is a very smart girl, and she will very likely excel in school. We absolutely believe she will. Now just hoping she stays this interested in the years to come. Fingers crossed!",,3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NG5DEAAE
