I distinctly remember my best friend Steven in the party. He organized the entire event with some help from my other friends and family. I suspected something was up when a few of my friends texted me around the same time span. I usually don't get texted at that high of a frequency. My suspicions were confirmed when I got home. My friends and family were all there with some gifts. There was also some decorations here and there. They all wished me a happy birthday. I was a bit flustered about all of it. I was also a bit tired from work. It was still quite enjoyable. I chatted with my friends and family. We had some cake and drinks. I liked the thoughtful gifts as well. Overall, it was a good time.",3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIMO2IIP,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIMO2IIP
