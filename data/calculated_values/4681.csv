Despite obsessing over my figure and the scale, I've never been a healthy weight. I really do try to eat healthily, but food is more than just sustenance. It's a reward. It's comfort. When I've had a bad day or am under a lot of stress, a switch flips off in my brain, the switch that cares about what I'm eating. And so, I stuff my face full of every rich, fattening food I can get my hands on. Then, I feel really bad about it, so guess what I do? I have a good cry. I put on my determined face. I look up healthy recipes and resolve not to do it again, but I still hate myself for having done it, and the switch flips off again. I finally decided that enough is enough. Normal people aren't like this. I booked a therapist and waited and ate my way through the month until I could finally talk to her. I told her about my habits and my relationship with food. And I was right, there was something wrong with me. She told me I had something called a binge eating disorder. Being overweight and being told that I have an eating disorder was a shock. I'd only heard of anorexia and bulimia, but I wasn't a rail thin supermodel with body dysmorphia. She told me some healthy ways to cope with my emotions that don't involve food. This was the root of the problem after all.",,3PS7W85Z80OYUBG91B6SED2OP9Y9TG
