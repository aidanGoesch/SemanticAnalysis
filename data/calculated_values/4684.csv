I will admit that I don't go to visit her nearly as much as I should in the nursing home but to be honest it really just breaks my heart to do so. She seems so miserable and she looks so unhealthy. She's lost so much weight and her hair has gotten so white and thin. It's hard to look at this sickly and frail old woman and try to equate her with the strong and sweet woman that I grew up with. Living over an hour away most of our conversations have had to be over the phone and maybe that's just better for us both. Sometimes when I do visit she cries a lot and I feel so awful because there's nothing I can do to alleviate her sadness and pain. I was working from home today and my mom called to tell me that she was visiting Nana and that Nana wanted to talk to me. I've always been a really literal person so I pay a lot of attention not only to what people say but how they say it. She didn't say that she wanted me to talk to Nana, but that Nana wanted to talk to me. Which meant that she asked my mom to contact me. I know this might not seem like a big deal to most people, but it really was a huge deal to me because Nana has had a series of strokes over the past few years and her speech never truly recovered from the last one. Communicating is extremely frustrating for her as well as us. So that means that she was able to communicate well enough that my mother was able to understand what she wanted her to do. So, I told my mom to go ahead and put her on the phone. As soon as I heard her voice filter through the headset, I greeted her warmly and asked if the hospital staff was treating her well. She started trying to say something and was stammering really badly. Knowing that this is the point in which she usually gets frustrated and gives up, I encouraged her to think very carefully about what she wanted to say and try again. We went through that for several minutes before she could finally get out the words that ""She had me on her mind and she just wanted to tell me that she loved me."" The rest of our conversation was pretty much me guessing what she was trying to convey and her either confirming or denying that my guess was right. I remain astounded that those words were completely clear and everything else she said was gibberish. It was as if she had said the most important thing and was ok with everything else being muddled.",,3PS7W85Z80OYUBG91B6SED2OPB99TV
