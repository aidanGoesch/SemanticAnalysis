I am not entirely sure how I have made it through this long. I am going stir crazy. Everything I have tried has proved to be a failure of the utmost proportions. This has made me appreciate things a lot more. I have learned better to accept what I have and not always be looking for something better. This shows me that where I am and what I have can be enough, stop constantly be on the look out for upgrades. I have now seen what I can get by with if I do not completely adopt the consumer culture so many of us have embraced. When you actually live on the things you need, you realize all of the stuff you spend money on that could be better spent elsewhere. Imagine the time I could have if I did not need to work all the time. This makes me realize I should save more so I can retire early. I need to enjoy more of my limited time. I need to be the with people that I enjoy, not just working constantly. I need to work to live, not live to work. I am definitely embracing this new outlook. When I find a job, I am going to be picky and do something that fits me. I will not just take the first thing or the best paying. That is not the priority anymore.",,3PS7W85Z80OYUBG91B6SED2OY3KT9J
