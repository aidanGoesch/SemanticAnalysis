The benefits and vacation time were good and to top it all, I am able to travel to many places as part of my job. I felt everything has fallen in place for me and for the first time in a long time, I was on top of the world. Everyone was happy about me obtaining the job and able to afford to eat at fine dining restaurants, drive a very nice car, stay at the finest hotels and take my family to places they never thought they will see. My husband and I were pulling close to 300,000 a year with both incomes and to me, life was grand. I wasn't stinking wealthy but I were living great. I talked about my experiences often with friends, showing off places  my family and I went, snapping pictures of wads of cash with captions here and there. Some noted as 'haters this could be you too!' The places I used to frequent with friends became less and less and I somehow found myself not exactly on the same levels as my friends anymore.  I noticed I here less and less from each of them as time passed.  Initially I did not think much of it until one day a long time good friend of mines wanted to have serious chat. She noticed a change of attitude with me and said I was not the same as woman she used to know. I had the tendency to humble brag a lot and seem to distanced myself away from everyone else. Other friends thought the same but fear upsetting me. I felt a bit shocked about  how everyone felt and I apologized if I allowed my job to change who I were. Unfortunately that friend and I is no longer close like we used to be and a few others left my life too. I felt horrible about the outcome and made a conscious decision to humble myself. What comfort me is everything happens for a reason and a lesson to be learn is to not only be grateful but towards close to me ands not allow superficiality be a theme of my life.",,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFG9W21A
