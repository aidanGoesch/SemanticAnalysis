I said ok. It had been a while since I visited that restaurant. When I walked in, I saw many different faces. The place felt out of order and everyone's face was new to me. I stand in the middle and introduce myself. I forgot exatly what I said but everyone in there ignored me. As the day went by at work I caught myself feeling frustrated and somehow pushy and rude. One coworker told me to chill and take a breather. I got even more challanged, so I started ranting about the things that I tought should be organized. Soon I found myself complaning about everyhting and not helping to my best or even working.  I had then realized that I entered their enviroment and that I was there to HELP them & not ORGANIZE or try to work  the place the way I usually do at the other restaurant. I realized I had let my ego get the best of me. It was embarrasing after I left work because even in the owners face looked disappointed in me. I learned not to get too big headded after that. I deliver good work but that's all I shouldn't try to be above my peers.",,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFG9W21A
