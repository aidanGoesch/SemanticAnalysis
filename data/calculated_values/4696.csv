I've always been a baker. I wanted to take what was my hobby of baking and turn it in to a profitable business. I decided to start being a cake maker. I had been contacted by a couple who were having a wedding. They wanted a cake from me. I was more than happy to start working on it for them. Even though it was my first wedding cake I think I did a great job on it. It was the big day and I was on my way to take it over to their wedding chapel and get it set up. When I was about 5 minutes away from the chapel I got a phone call. It was my husband and he was saying that my son had broken his arm. I had to hurry and get the cake set up as fast as I could so I could deal with my son. I got the cake set up in 5 minutes flat and then rushed over to the hospital. My son was there and crying. I couldn't believe this happened on such a day.,,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFPWF12B
