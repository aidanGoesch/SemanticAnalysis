I started a from home bakery about a year ago and have been blessed with a lot of business but mostly smaller cakes. I agreed to take on a large three tier wedding cake this summer. This is by far the largest cake I have ever made. This cake was also to be square which is a difficult shape to maintain on a cake because you not only have to get your icing smooth but you also have to keep your corners sharp. I was so very nervous about making and setting up this cake. The morning of the wedding I was already a nervous wreck. We received a phone call at about 4 that morning saying that my father in law had had a stroke and was in the ICU. I contacted the brides sister in law who was handling all of the plans and and spoke with her about the situation. I packed up all of mine and my 2 small kids stuff for a weeks worth of clothes and snacks to make the 4 hour drive. I packed the cake unassembled in my car and went to the church. I was able to manage watching my 2 little kids and set up the wedding cake without any serious issues. The bride was very happy with the cake.  The cake looked wonderful, I got a bunch of good pictures to post on my business page which was very helpful to me. I then got my kids and myself squared away in the car and made the 4 hour drive to my in laws home.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFPWF12B,
