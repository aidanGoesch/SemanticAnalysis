Her name was Maggie. She is so lovely, adorable and fun to be with. You will always find her every were around the house thinking it has twin sisters, she does not have a twin sisters, she just wont stay in one place. Maggie will follow you every where even when you do not notice her following you. She lived with us for a very long time and we are so used to her being around us. Maggie maintained a peaceful coexistence with our other animals.  She spent 18 years with us which is year younger than than our first daughter. She really loved Maggie and she grew up so fond of her. She would cuddle Maggie like a baby, feed Maggie from her food, share her bed with Maggie. Maggie had become a significant member of the family that we have so grown up being fund of her forgetting that shes getting old too and she was going to leave us someday. Suddenly she became ill and she started shedding away her fur, We too her to the nearby Veterinary hospital hoping they could save her at all cost because we dont want to let go of her. We were not left with much of a choice as we could not save her. We lost her, it was a devastating moment and no other pet can replace Maggie. Rest on Maggie.",,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFRK312D
