On that raining faithful night I survived unharmed.    Days after I became more aware of my driving habits.  I soon became more aware of my surroundings while driving.  If I was in traffic I slowed down.  If I was near other cars I really became more aware of my speed.  I also payed more attention to the position of my truck related to the other cars.  I noticed if I was in the center of the lane.  I noticed if I was too far right or too far left.  I tried to stay in the middle of the traveling lane as much as possible.  I noticed other changes as well.  I seem to enjoy my drive even more reflecting on how I should enjoy life. I noticed how good each day and complained less.  My drive home after work did not seem that bad any more.  I appreciate the small joys in life.,32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP9EPHOS,
