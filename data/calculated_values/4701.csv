I went straight to bed and slept for 2 hours. When I got up, as I walked up the hallway I saw Maggie (cat) with her head half under some furniture in a ""pounce"" stance.  I thought ""oh no, shes' trapped a mouse"". Nope, that was not it!!  Maggie was 18 years old. We got her when she was a a baby and my youngest daughter was 3 years old.  She stayed in the house and never went outside.  She still enjoyed being brushed and petted, but she did not like to be ""bothered"". So, back to that day... When I moved the furniture where I could see Maggie's whole body, it became obvious that something was going on.  She stayed in that ""pounce"" stance but had her head buried in the floor.  My plan was to take her to the vet in the am. I felt certain she would need to be euthanized. She was in the same position but breathing heavy. Finally the vet opened.  I put Maggie in her box. She was still alive, but barely. I heard her stir a little while on the 30 minute drive to the vet. Once at the vet, I opened the box and found she was no longer breathing.  I stood looking at her and crying for a few minutes and then finally told the vet staff I felt like she had already passed. The vet staff immediately took me to the back where the Dr. came and confirmed her death. . They gave her back to me (at my request) and I brought her back home.  For the next few days, I missed her meowing in the mornings and evenings to be fed.  My children, although grown, miss her as well.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFRK312D,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFRK312D
