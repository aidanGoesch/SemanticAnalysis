They gave us a T-shirt but what was on the T-shirt was unbelievable. It was a picture of our future grandson. I was so proud of my son and his wife. My wife gave both of them a big hug to celebrate the good news. I shook both of their hands. We all had some tears of joy that day. I celebrated by taking us all out to eat steak. I got a big steak with beer. My wife got a small steak. My son and wife shared a giant steak. It was a great way to celebrate the soon birth of a new boy into this world. I hope he will be healthy. I hope he will be smart. I hope he will be strong.",,3PWWM24LHTK4W73MD4GIDUYN27P82F
