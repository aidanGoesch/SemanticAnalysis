We were excited about that. They live about 2 hours from here. So, my husband and I clean the house, got ourselves all dressed nice and looked forward to them ringing the doorbell. They arrived, sat down and they had a heart shaped red box and they handed it to me and said, ""We just got you a little something."" I lifted the lid on the box, moved all the tissue paper, and saw the sleeve of a little white T shirt. My husband later said that he was a little confused about what it was. We had never expected to have this surprise as we did not think that our son and his wife planned to have children. I started crying immediately. I couldn't believe it. Then my husband realized what it meant and he almost cried as well. After we settled down, we talked with them about what a great surprise this was and asked them what made them change their minds. They just said that their life was different now, and they thought they would stop trying not to have a baby, and just see what happened. So there we have it. We are going to be grandparents, and they are going to be parents, and that is what we are the most happy about.  We look forward to watching and helping them on this journey.",3PWWM24LHTK4W73MD4GIDUYN27P82F,
