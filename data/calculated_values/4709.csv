I don't have much money with me but I just hope there is nothing God cannot do. Many of my friends also encouraged me to celebrate it in a big way since it 30th celebration. It was a three days to the event and many things that we needed has not been gotten. I was already thinking of not celebrating it and just do it in a small way. In the evening, My son called me and told me he is sending a big amount of money to me for the celebration. I was happy and that was a great relief to me. After some times I receive credit notification, that was from my son. I called him to appreciate him. Bout Five minute later, another credit notification, this time, it was my friends. I was not expecting that much from them. At first, don't know all the details about the money, it was when one of the called me that he explained everything to me. I was speechless but extremely happy. At this moment, I have more than enough to spend for the anniversary. The following day, we got all we needed and make all the necessary preparations. The anniversary went well and everyone that came was satisfied.",3PWWM24LHTK4W73MD4GIDUYNVVC827,
