I was really missing him, so I decided to plan a trip there 4 months ago during March Madness. We  used to watch a lot of games together when I was younger, so I thought this would be the perfect time to go see him. he was so excited when I called to tell him I booked my flight that I could barely get him off the phone. I got there on a Monday and planned on staying until Sunday. He insisted I stay with him and his wife and kids instead of paying for a hotel, and I could not argue with that. Plus, he said his wife and kids were going to visit her mom for a few days while I'd be there, so we'd have the house to invite some people over. The week was a blast. I'm so used to being around him with his family that I almost forgot how much fun he used to be before he got remarried. We went to the games, hung out at sports bars, ate like  kings are some fantastic restaurants, including a few hidden gems only frequented by the locals. We also did some gambling. But, I think my favorite part was him inviting some of his buddies over and seeing him relax and have fun with his friends. What can be better than male bonding over sports, right? Plus, I had forgotten how great he was with the grill. I'm really glad I went. I wasn't sure if I should take the time off work, but I'm really happy that I did. I definitely had a great time and brought home some unforgettable memories.",,3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MECVBAV
