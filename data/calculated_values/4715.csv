It was a big decision to go back to school. I had to consider the time that would be required and how that would affect my family. I had small children that required a lot of attention. The most notable concern was the cost though. I was worried about whether the cost would be worth it in terms of future employment opportunities. I decided to return, despite the cost, and earned my bachelor's degree after a lot of hard work and dedication. It took me a couple of years of hard work and studying. A lot of the time I had to study at night when my family was sleeping. In the end, I gained a great education but financially, it was a significant amount of debt to take on. I have large student loans and two children that will be going to college as well. I was and still am proud of myself for finishing college but I assumed a large debt in the form of student loans to do so. This is still a major concern as I continue to make payments on the debt. When I graduated my mom gave me a large cash gift as congratulations for graduating. This was a great help and unexpected but I still have a significant amount of student loan debt that will take me years to pay off.",3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MM3HAB6,
