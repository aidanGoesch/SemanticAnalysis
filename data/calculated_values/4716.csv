I took online classes while I worked and it took me about two years to finish. I felt like I had made great sacrifices while I was in classes, missing family events, suffering financial burden, and being generally over worked. It all paid off though when I finally got my degree.  I took on a lot of student debt but feel it was worth it. Not only do I have my degree now, which gives me personal satisfaction, I also am able to get a better job. I  had a small celebration with family after I graduated. My mom gave me a very generous gift which helped with student loans. I was really surprised since I am older now and have kids of my own. I really wasn't expecting any gifts. I was very proud though and pleased with the gift. It helps relieve some of the student debt I incurred. My wife also returned to school around the same time I did. She graduated as well and we both have felt very positive about completing the goal. I am so glad I decided to go back to school. This has been one of the most exciting things that I have done as an adult.",3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MM3HAB6,3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MM3HAB6
