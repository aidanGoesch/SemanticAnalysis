We all knew it was coming but it was still devastating. She was the rock and center of our family. Everyone always went to her for advice and encouragement. She had been suffering from a long illness and we were all happy that she was no longer suffering but sad for the loss of her.  I made notes during the months leading up to her death and I am glad that I did. It is nice to look over those notes and relive our last times together. When she first became sick and told us she would not live out the year I decided to keep track of my feelings after each of my visits with her. Firstly, I wish that I could have visited more often, but work and the care of my children had to come first. Grandmother understood this and was very happy for our weekly visits. I decided that I would ask her questions about her youth and the things that happened to her that I had never gotten around to asking before. I am so glad that we had these conversations and Grandmother was happy to share them. She described her childhood and school years and the dreams that she had as a girl. She told me about meeting my Grandfather and having and her children. Her stories were filled with happy memories with a few funny ones and a few sad ones. In the early stages of her illness we would take a walk or go to lunch and we both thoroughly enjoyed those days. Later I would sit by her bedside and listen to her stories, and she always had new ones to tell. These days made me realize how my Grandmother had a great life and and she was at peace with dying when the time finally came. I was also at peace because she had a life well lived. I had many emotions during our times together and it is nice to look over my notes and recall those emotions. I vowed to live my life fully and enjoy every minute and pass on all my stories to my children and grandchildren. I love my Grandmother more than ever and cherish those last days we had together. I had feelings of sadness, happiness, laughter and tears and it was wonderful!",,3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU64BD2CK
