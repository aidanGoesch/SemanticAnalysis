There I witnessed an exciting and memorable moment. I had to deal with my 2 year old since my daughter and husband were both in the wedding. My son is different than most kids. He might have autism. So during the ceremony itself he was not quiet and couldn't sit still. My husband was holding him. I had to go around the person filming the wedding and take him, missing the ceremony. Before I left though, I noticed that the groom's father and step mother were getting annoyed by my son, casting angry looks back at him and shaking their head. I understand, I do, but I can't just exclude him from events because he is different. I took him to the back and let him run around a little bit. I was really upset by what happened. This is just a little innocent boy. He doesn't think there is anything wrong with him, he is just special. I was offended and got upset because I was just really hurt that someone could look at my baby that way. I was on the verge of tears that someone could treat him that way. He doesn't understand it is time to be quiet, he loves being outside, so he likes to run, it is hard to keep him still. I just wish people would think before casting glances and saying hurtful things. I apologized to my sister in law and her husband but they didn't even care. They love him, they know how he is, and they were sorry for his dad acting the way he did. It made me feel a little better but I was still upset.",3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6K572CI,3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6K572CI
