First off, I want to start off by saying I love my job. I love my coworkers, my duties, the environment I'm in. I couldn't think of a better place to work. Everything around me seemed pretty perfect. I was making good money, and having a good time while I was doing it. However, as they say, nothing lasts forever. Just when I thought things were finally settling in for me, I had a run in with my manager that left me questioning everything. I never thought he would treat me the way he did that day. I remember coming home crying and feeling so embarrassed. I didn't even want to face my coworkers anymore after knowing they saw the way he had treated me. I didn't feel like showing up to work anymore, period! Later that day when I went home, I already began debating my future there. I knew my manager had treated other employees that way, but I just never thought it'd happen to me, since I always tried to be the best employee I could be. I felt so unappreciated and like I wouldn't even have a future there. I spent a long time deliberating, but ultimately, I decided it would be best for me to leave that place to avoid ever being treated like that again. I knew I deserved better.",,3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6TSUC2Y
