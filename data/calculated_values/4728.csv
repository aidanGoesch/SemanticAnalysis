All of us girls were so close in college we were in the same sorority we cheered together and we truely were best friends. it makes me sad to think how we got so far from each other when we use to be so close. The one friend christy has 2 kids that i have never even seen before. i have to say facebook lets me know what they are doing but it's stilln ot the same. nora has 2 kids a lawyer and an amazing husband. how did we go from being best friends to barely even knowing each other.,,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRER0HL518
