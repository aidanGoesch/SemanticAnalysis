My good friend Charlie was getting married to his lover.  They had only met a few months ago so we all had our reservations, but he seemed to be completely enamored with her.  So I declared that we should meet her before we approved of their union.  Charlie agrees that we should have a night of food and drink together with his future wife and her friends. We had a grand old night of debauchery and ultimately we came to conclusion that she was a fine woman.  Six months ago I attended his wedding.  It had been some time since we had seen each other due to our unique obligations, but I greeted Charlie as I walked into the venue of his wedding.  We embraced and talked of the things that come to pass while we were apart.  We had indeed had many adventures since we had last seen each other.  I gave him words of encouragement and joined my wife with the other guests awaiting the ceremony to begin. All in all I am hopeful for their future and have nothing but confidence in their marriage.  The future that awaits us is always uncertain but we can only walk forward with confidence and grace.  Maybe miracles do happen and fate joins us with people who we are truly meant to be with. Maybe we are all just drifting stars orbiting the nearest celestial beings.  Maybe, just maybe we make our own fate.",,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRER0HL518
