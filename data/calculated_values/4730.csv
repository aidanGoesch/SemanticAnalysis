It was a lot of fun. I took a train to get there and then hung out with a different buddy until we went to the wedding. I got there 1 day and then we ended up drinking that night and reminiscing because we hadn't hung out in a good 5 years before that so it was nice to catch up. I got to meet his new girlfriend who seemed pretty cool and chill. We all had a good time that night. I woke up the next morning before anyone else. I took a shower, got dressed, and made some food. I was really nervous about seeing everyone again and I had a lot of anxiety. I started drinking pretty early just to calm the nerves. They eventually got up and got dressed and we headed out. We got there late because they were messing around so that really annoyed me. Then, they were speeding because of this. Like, if you didn't sleep all day, we could have avoided this. We got there and sat down and the wedding was basically over so I was pretty annoyed about that. It was an open bar so I just kept drinking. I talked to a bunch of people I hadn't seen in a while and it was nice. They did all the wedding stuff you know, speeches and crap. We ate some food and I went back to drinking. We left when the night was over and headed back to dudes house to hang out and then passed out.",,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRER0HL518
