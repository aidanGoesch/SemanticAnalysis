The night that he died, I was at work, and had I realized he was going to pass so soon I would have gone to the hospital to see him. I had seen him earlier in the week multiple times; he had varying states of lucidity, as he was in a lot of pain. However, we did get to communicate a fair amount. He knew I was there, and he knew that I loved him. But I work kind of a weird schedule, and I had to leave. It was hard to see him suffer. He had always been a very healthy person, even through his five-year battle with lung cancer. However, his health had declined rapidly, and he now had pneumonia. The most memorable event, sad to say, was likely when I received the text message from my mother telling me that he had passed. She had tried calling, but my phone was charging elsewhere. Once, a great-uncle had died and I found out on Facebook before anyone told me. I was very hurt by that, and she had tried to avoid something like that since. But she texted my brother and I as she couldn't get ahold of us by phone. I was at work, and I went to my desk and cried for a bit. Then I talked to my boss and asked for the next few days off as bereavement leave. I really did not expect him to go that soon, and I was so sad that I couldn't be there to say goodbye.",,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRER8BB15Q
