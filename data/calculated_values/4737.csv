We had to put her to sleep. I loved her very much and I miss her now. I think of her every day.  We buried her by the river in a beautiful place. I have told my family that I want my ashes to be placed near her when I die. Oddly, I almost look forward to it. It is very comforting to think of resting near her. She was a very good friend. She followed me from room to room and often slept on my head while I slept.  Sometimes she slept with her cheek against mine.  She was extraordinarily beautiful with a long face and very long slender legs.  Her feet were very small.  I think she was a special breed and a little wild.  She walked like a tiger.",,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRERBW415S
