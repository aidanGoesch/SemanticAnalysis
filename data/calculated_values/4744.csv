I have been fortunate enough until now to not know the pain of losing family members--pets were very difficult, but expected. I had no idea how to handle what I was feeling. My great, great uncle-- in his 90s-- accidentally crushed his legs between a truck and his own car. Both of his legs were completely shattered. He was in the ICU for a week having multiple surgeries done to him. It brought up a lot of feelings that I wasn't expecting to have, especially torwards a man I hardly knew and disliked more than I liked. I found myself tempted to pray, despite being raised as an atheist. Things were looking okay once the surgery was done, though. He would have a long road to being better, but he'd live. Then, there was a blood clot and he had a massive stroke. It resulted in a coma. He didn't wake up for another week. I sat there and wondered if anybody would listen to my input, if we would let him go, if we would have to be there when he was unplugged. There was almost no chance of him waking up. Technically, since then, he has woken up. He hasn't opened his eyes or woken up yet. His brain is probably not there anymore. I don't know what could possibly happen that was good out of this. He won't ever be the person he was before. I never really got a chance to meet him. My great great uncle is so overcome with guilt that he will die soon, most likely--he's lost so much weight. His wife is in terrible condition as well. Most of my friends don't really understand why I've been so distant but I just want to be with my family lately. I'm not sure if I have a right to mourn him, but I'm really saddened by it all.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZG28585
