I thought I would suffer now and embrace the fruits of my labor later on. I also didn't have the best upbringing, though I had no doubt that I was loved. It was just hard for me to ever put myself first and it's a lesson that I still struggle with. That being said, things came to a boil in May of 2019. I had finally graduated the college I had been slogging over for the past four years. Trials and tribulations were a common occurrence. It was hard to have a social, personal, or just a fun life. My nose was always in some kind of book, and not even a lot of interesting ones. Finally, in May I had seen the things that I wanted to come to fruition happen. It was hard to be praised but I let it happen. As my name was called to walk down the aisle, I heard shouting from certainly my family, who had shown up for me. It was a moment that the loans that I pay now can't put a price on. It's a memorable day. I still get chills thinking about it.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZM8X58C
