I'd been living paycheck to paycheck, and despite all the Dave Ramsey videos I've seen, I never put away any money for an emergency. When my dog got sick, I ended up spending about $5,000 at the vet. When rent came due, I asked my landlord to work with me, but he was a jerk about it and kicked us out.  That is when I found out what a true friend is. I ran into an old highschool friend Mary and her boyfriend. They offered me a spare room that was connected to their garage. It's not half bad. My dog and I have our own space, and my friend isn't charging us rent. Now I have a chance to save up some money and get that emergency fund going!  I don't plan on finding myself in this position again. I do know that no matter what happens in life, Mary will always be a friend of mine.  I'm pretty sure Red, my dog, feels the same way. By the way, he isn't sick anymore. It ended up he had a tumor, but it's been removed and he's doing great.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZMIV58U
