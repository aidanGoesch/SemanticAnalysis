I was sleeping in my car and unsure where life would lead me. My boots would get rained and I would walk around with wet shoes, which made me constantly ill for the duration of my slight homeless adventure. I had planned to move in with my beau who had just left the area to return home. I met friends who shared similar situations with me, many unsure of how & if their lives would ever change: many who were judged by the townspeople they encountered. Beautiful people with all the potential in the world; although it may not seem that way. One day, a few of these friends were on their way to an Indian Reservation somewhere in the desert states. They asked if I wanted to join, and although I wanted to, I instead called my beau and inquired if he would like a visit. He told me that I could just stop by and stay until I built myself up. I was incredibly grateful to finally be leaving this situation, although I still miss the friends I had made. I plan to make a trip up there soon, and hope to see them living their best lives possible. I worry about them, but know they have a great group to make sure everyone's alright. I hope that anyone in similar places in life knows that it is only temporary and hope that the world works together to ensure that no one is without their own shelter: where they feel comfortable and can exist as they like. Judging those going through difficult times is counterproductive and only induces hate. I believe that if communities and the world work together, this is an easy issue to solve.",3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZMIV58U,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZMIV58U
