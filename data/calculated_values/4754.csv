While doing routine pre-surgery bloodwork, they noted that my HCG levels were high, which could indicate pregnancy. At the time, I was taking HCG injections to help with weight loss; I informed them this was the only reason, and there was absolutely no way I could be pregnant. My significant other and I had split up in September, and I had not been sexually active since. The surgery team decided to do an ultrasound just as a precaution. This was very frustrating; I was quite nervous about the surgery, and this delay was fraying my nerves even more. I was wheeled down to imaging and the ultrasound machine was brought in. The nurse who performed the ultrasound was very quiet, and spent way longer examining me than I anticipated. Soon after she left, my orthopedic surgeon came in and informed me that I was in fact 5 months pregnant. I had become pregnant right before my significant other and I separated. I had only gained 3-4 pounds, and was not showing whatsoever. My surgery was of course cancelled, and instead of going home to recover from knee surgery, I instead went home to spend the next 4 months learning how to be a mother. I had absolutely no intentions of having children. My son was born on May 8th, and he is absolutely the best plot twist to ever occur in my life. My knee surgery has been rescheduled for this October, and I have assured my surgeon there will be absolutely no surprises this time!",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZP0X852
