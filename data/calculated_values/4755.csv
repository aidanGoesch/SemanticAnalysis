The daily grind can get to you and make you hateful. I thanked in my mind many people that helped me in my life. I thanked my mom for being loving and supportive with my ventures and forgiving my mistakes. I thanked my dad for making me tough and teaching my life skills on how to succeed. I thanked my brother on how to stand up to bullies in the world. I thanked my grandma for her support. I thanked my grandfather for his wisdom. I thanked my dog for helping me out in the bad days. I am very grateful to all of these people. I am grateful for people who make good food. I am thankful to the people who made great shows. This has helped me in life. It has made me have smiles. I hope my life will get better.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6S2C5P
