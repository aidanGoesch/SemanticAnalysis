I had all my friends and family come over. I told everybody how grateful you've all been about helping my life. I am very satisfied about my life. I hugged my mother and she cried a little because of this. I hugged my father and he also cried. I gave my friends some fist bumps. We all celebrated with a giant pizza party. I got a meat lovers with mushrooms. It was delicious and I finished the whole thing by myself. Everybody else just got pepperoni pizza. They all finished their pizzas. There was also beer to enjoy. I drank a few that day. I almost puked. This day will be remembered for eternity.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6S2C5P
