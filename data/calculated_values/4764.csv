So, This was how my birthday party was ended happily and satisfyingly. After that I went to my private room and thanked god for helping me to have such good friends and family.  Yesterday when I got home from school I went to play with my friends. Some people from other streets were playing in the area where we were playing, and when they heard this was our area, they refused to go and tried to fight us. In that case, a friend of mine had hit one of them in the face with anger.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6S2C5P
