We haven't had one in over 20 years. This was a very exciting event. I saw my Grandma who said I liked great as ever. I saw my Grandpa who said I was getting strong. My Aunt looked lovely and thanked me for the compliment. My Uncle still smoked a lot. We had a nice feast. There were plenty of steaks to go around the whole family. There were some nice mashed potatoes to eat. They had gravy on the side. There was a big cake to share with everybody. It was a chocolate cake. There was also horseshoes to play. I barely beat my Uncle. We vowed to keep in touch.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K
