We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace. We got to really spend some time together that wasn't rushed and catch up on at least a decade worth of misc stuff. It was surprising how much fun it was because I always had memories of being bored out of my mind. I guess when you're a kid/teen you would rather be doing other stuff but now that I'm an adult I understood the value of it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to squander these moments as we never know if they will be the last. Some of my family had passed away in the time frame from when we last met up for the holidays and the reunion so I won't ever get to spend time with them again and that sucks. It was really good to see my aunt and uncle again as they are the most similar to myself with our love for technology and in general relaxed personalities. I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide. I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact. We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest. I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family. I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try. I will look at my relationships with my distant family and friends more so we stay more connected. It was great to write about this again because I feel like this is a different view from the last time since I have been chatting with my family more since the last time I did this.,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,
