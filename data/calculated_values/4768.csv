It's always seems to be the same scenario - they think I'm over confident.  About two months ago, I was given a peach assignment as a lead on a project.  I was so excited and energized while my colleagues were kind of resistent and downplayed the importance of the project.  They told me I was too optimistic because in the end the project would fail like all the other projects regardless of effort.  They told me it would be a big fall if I didn't come down from the clouds.  Instead of listening to them I started looking at the psychology behind their attitudes of impending failure.  I realized that they were missing the ""what's in it for me"" concept.  They saw no benefit for them to a lot of effort and hard work.  I saw this as a challenge.  How do I make them see their effort as a win?  How can I quantify and qualify the outcomes of their efforts.  I decided to make sure every project task completion had an outcome of reward both tangible and intangible.  I showed them how the effort and work they are doing benefits their customer, and themselves.  The reward of  successful completion leads to provable skill and knowledge.  I found the sweet spots of their sense of accomplishment and motivations and used it to garner their buy-in and support.  With everyone on the same page moving us toward success my colleagues were genuinely more helpful and excited to help me as a project lead.  In two months time the whole attitude of our team has changed.  They no longer see me as the young pup.  They h ave accepted me as a leader even though most of them are 20 years older than me.  I don't feel anxious and eager to please.  I have found their motiviations and I have earnestly tried to encourage and care for their successes as well as my own.  Last week I was able to provide a recommendation for a team member who intially had resisted the project because of her 180 degree turn around. Because of her changes in attitude she became a focal team member and will be leading her own project team soon.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXID2LC5Z
