Due to work constraints I was unable to attend last year, so it was nice to finally catch up with some relatives who I haven't seen in a while. The nearly five hour drive was relatively unpleasant, but it was nice to pull in before sunset on that Friday in order to get my tent set up. As I arrived the massive fire pit at my uncle's house was already glowing brightly from the road. I could also see a number of friendly cars parked along the driveway. My tent was easy enough to set up despite it being two years since I needed it, and upon completion I staked my chair around the fire pit next to a handful of cousins. Along with brats, hot dogs, and burgers, the amount of food we had at our disposal was quite impressive. Not only were there vegan and gluten free options, but we had just about every possible bowl of salad imaginable. I hardly felt guilty going back for three plates worth of food. As we sat near the fire drinking, playing games, and eating leftovers, it was crazy how quickly time flew. Before we even realized it Saturday morning had arrived and it was time to retreat to our tents. I managed to awake earlier than usual, and walked into the house to see what can only be considered a glorious sight. Two serving trays loaded with fresh donuts were waiting there for the family for breakfast. I thought I was still dreaming, but I took three anyway. Though I wasn't looking forward to my long drive home, those donuts sure did hit the spot! It was also really great spending time with such a large group of family members, and it really makes me regret missing last year. I'm counting down the days until next year already!",3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXIFRFC59,
