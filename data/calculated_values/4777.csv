I was riding my bike. I crossed the street but somebody ran a red light. I'm glad I had my helmet on or I would of died. I broke a leg over the accident. I had to be rushed to the hospital. It was a very painful ordeal to go through. I got a cast. The doctor said not to walk for a few months. I had to watch old television shows in the hospital. The food in the hospital wasn't too bad. I had some meat loaf with mashed potatoes. The bill for the hospital was a little high but my insurance covered it. I realized the importance of helmets. I will being only biking in the park from now on.",,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5DT920G
