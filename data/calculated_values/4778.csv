No matter they weregood or bad, they all were impressive in my memory. The mostmemorable event in my life is the trip I took to Japan and stayed there forone month in last summer vacation. I went there to study and travel. Andthat was the first time I went abroad by myself without the company of myfamily or friends. I went to Tokyo that was located in the middle of Japan. It is a big city in Japan with a large population and a convenient publictransportation system. There are many convenient JR lines for people totake. That is the reason why Japanese don't ride motorcycles. Theenvironment also benefits from it. A car accident of which I was the victim occurred last year at a roadjunction. One day, I was riding my motorcycle to buy some food. When Iwas waiting for crossing the street intersection, a car rushed by a red lightand crashed into the ass end of my motorcycle. We had a fender bender. Although it was not a serious accident, I had the jitters because I wasshot out of my motorcycle. If I didn’t wear a hard helmet, I could have hadmy head smashed in that position. Fortunately, I just suffered only a minorconcussion and slight abrasion on my right knee and back. However, I was very angry at the driver because he tried to hit and run. Luckily, someone helped me on my feet and asked me, “Did youremember the plate number of the hit and run car? Did you need anambulance?” I shook my head. I scolded in my mind and reflected, “Whydidn’t the driver observe the rules? Every one should observe the trafficregulations!”Finally, I just had to live with my bad luck and went home. Fortune ofthe misfortune was that I didn't get heavy hurt. Nonetheless, the accidenttaught me a lesson that wearing a safety helmet is very important. I thinkthe car accident is an unforgettable experience in my life..",,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5DT920G
