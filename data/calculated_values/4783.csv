When the time came, we all came together and celebrated the event. My friend Ben had dated his Fiancee, Dora for 6 years. They were now going to wed. Arrangements had been made and put in place. All the invitees had received their invitation cards and all was set for the big day. Every body was in the mood. All was set. Dora's parents were the happiest of all seeing their only daughter take a big step into happiness. She was to  get married to the love of her life. They had waited long enough and Actually Dora had confirmed being 2 months pregnant.  Ben was so happy knowing that a few months into marriage and he will be a father. Little did he know what was waiting for him on the day of the wedding.  The day was finally here and and the grand exchange of vows was on going. When it came to Dora's time, the worst happened that will forever remain in my mind like it happened yesterday. Dora took to her heels running across the church leaving everyone flabbergasted. That was the last we heard of her. What we came to learn later on is that, her pregnancy was not Ben's but from her immediate Boss.",,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5K3X20V
