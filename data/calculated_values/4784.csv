I had been laid off about 13 years ago. My previous employer has consistently told all of my prospective employers that I have MS. Much to the surprise of me and my husband, our friends and family donated over $100 to us. This has been such a blessing. We were both so surprised. We're going through litigation against my previous employer for disclosing personal information. They continue to do this to me. The $100 will help us out so much. I have been forever grateful. Once we win this case against my old employer, I will be able to pay back everyone who donated to us. I will be able to finally be past this. I will be able to actually get a job without worrying about them retaliating against me. I may not even have to work again. I will personally repay everyone who donated to us.",,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5LQG20P
