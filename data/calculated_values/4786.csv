It all started about 2 months ago...My husband and I were finally able to go on a short vacation for the first time since Lucifer and Euronymous were born.  Caring for twin boys has been quite a handful.  My mother agreed to come stay at our house and watch her grandsons for the 4 days and 3 nights we were gone.  The road trip was a success, very relaxing.  But when we got back some things didn't seem right.  The first thing I noticed was that the bed looked like a grenade went off in it.  More than one person had definitely been sleeping in it.  When I asked Mom about it she said her new husband (who no one likes) hadn't slept over during her stay, but she was obviously lying.  She finally admitted it.  Gross!  Secondly, I noticed that there weren't enough dirty diapers in the hamper.  She obviously wasn't changing the twins often enough.  And, lastly, she must've read my diary and not put it back in its hiding place.  I asked her but she said she never touched it.  It took me 2 months to find it, which is why I'm only writing in it now.  I found it underneath the dirty clothes hamper.  She must've put it there on purpose to torment me.  That's the last time I trust my Mom.",,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5VN802J
