Four months ago we left for our trip.   We were heading to Oregon to hike the Last Nevering Trail.  We had spent months planning for this and had brought all our supplies.  The trip was going to take about three weeks and we were going to be backpacking over 200 miles.  The trails were well developed but were totally removed from civilization.   We were so excited and looking forward to this trip!  However when we finally headed out we ran into a snag.  We were supposed to be parking our car at a safe place that is reserved for hikers with permits, which we had.  But we got a later start than intended and it was starting to get dark as we approached the trail head.  I don't know if there were road signs missing or what, but we just couldn't seem to find the parking area.  It was almost night time when we finally found it.  We weren't sure if we should even start the hike, but after all our planning we didn't know what else to do.  So we loaded up our gear and headed out.  We ended up hiking late into the night, using our headlamps to light the way..  It was not how we planned it but it ended up being totally serene and amazing.  The forest is so different at night compared to the daytime.  The moon was almost full and this made it even more exceptional.  We finally made camp around midnight, and all slept well.  I'm happy to say that the rest of our trip went perfectly and we didn't get lost again.",,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3R0CRLAW
