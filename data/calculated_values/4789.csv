We had all just turned 18 and were looking for something to together before we all left for university. The PCT is over 2000 miles long stretching from Canada all the way to Mexico and takes at least 6 months to complete. Our goal was to complete the Oregon section and backpack all the way across Oregon into Washington in 3 weeks or less. We grossly underestimated our task. Our first challenge arose just minutes after landing in the small municipal airport 30 minutes from the trail head. We needed to find someone to drive us to the trail head before nightfall, which was quickly approaching. We found someone willing to take the 6 of us in a minivan the 30 minutes to the trail head. The unfortunate part was that our driver had no idea where the trail start was - and neither did we. He ended up dropping us off on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere, just an hour before sunset. What we had though was the start to the trail ended up being just a game trail. We were lost in a foreign state, in the middle of nowhere with no signal to use GPS, the sun setting behind us. So we picked a direction and started walking down the gravel road. Several miles later of the same landscape along with the now high moon lighting the road, we flagged down a passing truck, the first person we had seen in hours. We explained to him what we were doing and that we were lost, he told us to keep walking down the road and we will eventually find a sheriffs station who can help us out. He also made sure to remind us of the impossibility of our goal and that we should just go home. Later in the night, closer to 1 am we came across a group of rangers performing a search and rescue, we again explain our situation and after their several minutes of amusement at our situation they tell us that the trail is less than a mile up a nearby path. They kindly give us some food and water along with a map and send us on our way. We reached the trail head that night and went on to complete the rest of the Oregon section within 3 weeks - probably to the surprise of the man in his truck. There were many other adventures and memories had within that time, but that is for another essay.",,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3R0CRLAW
