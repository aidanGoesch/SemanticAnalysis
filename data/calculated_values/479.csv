The beginning was rough as we had two to three hours delay with our flight. I were supposed reach at 8:00 pm local time but ended reaching there around 10:30 pm. We had problems with our transportation to our hotel. There was a misunderstanding with driver, took us to the wrong hotel. Finally, at 11:15 pm we reached our hotel. We were tired so could do nothing except going to bed. However, next morning we got amazed by the layout of casinos in the hotel; there were hundreds in number. After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such the water show at one of the hotels. We walked all day observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The night time was even more amazing with music and songs being played. There was a memorable volcanic eruption show at a hotel next to ours. The next day we took a tour bus and traveled to various parts of the city. It was very exhilarating. We had a great time in Las Vegas and going cherish it for a long time.",32ZKVD547G9CJNXCKGEXN6TG9E9B3U,32ZKVD547G9CJNXCKGEXN6TG9E9B3U
