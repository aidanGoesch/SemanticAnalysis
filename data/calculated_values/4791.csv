It happened during the summer time. I did not notice it at first, but then I did eventually. I thought it was very cool and unique. I have never seen that happen before. The eggs were a blue or turquoise color. The bird was always most of the time sitting on the eggs. So I got to see first hand up close what it looks like. The bird would always be looking into the window at me. It was a very unique experience. I was very happy to have experience such a rare event. It lasted for a few weeks or a month. The mother bird was very watchful and sometimes would perch up on our back roof near the nest. It was a very touching and memorable experience. I have never had something like that happen to me before to be so close to nature and wildlife.",,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RA9RALP
