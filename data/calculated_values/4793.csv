As I saw the beautiful dresses. All I could think was how beautiful my bride would look and how I wouldn’t want it to be anyone other than I person I was sitting next to. As I thought about it, listened to the music that surrounded the room. I watched the parties walk down the aisle I couldn’t help but be overcome with emotion. I was moments from crying, crying tears that were nothing but the happiest of tears. I continued to think about our future together and how a wedding and a ceremony to celebrate our love was only the beginning of our life together. It was only the start and there would be so much more to look forward to. We are expected to be somewhat emotional at weddings, this was a close friend of ours to be exact so it was to be expected. We knew the struggles the couple had faced so it was even more suitable to be emotional in this moment. However, what my future fiance did not know was the real reason I was so emotional, the real reason behind my happy tears. This would be something she would find out later in our relationship and something she would come to love. The more we began to know each other and the more I told her about those moments that made me fall in love with her, the more she fell in love with me. Those moments that I have to myself are so special to myself. Although at the time they were private and only shared by myself I remember with the fondest of memories.",3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RYWXALT,
