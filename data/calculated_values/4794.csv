I woke up and thought that not much would be different but I didn't realize how wrong I was. That day, my life would change forever, it was the day I decided to spend the rest of my life with the woman of my dreams. Months earlier we were invited to attend the wedding of good friends of ours. I knew the venue and where the wedding was to take place, I knew the people and frankly I didn't expect many surprises but from the minute I arrived I was proved wrong. As I sat down in the crowd at the reception area and the party began to walk down the aisle I felt tears rolling down my face. I couldn't contain the feelings of joy as the beautiful ceremony began. The music, the flowers, the dresses and suits, it was all just perfect. I remember vividly as the music began and the bride began to walk down the isle I thought about all the hardship they had endured and how happy this couple was to be together and how lucky I was to be spending this day with them. It was at this moment that I looked over at my, now fiancee, and began to think about how she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She was the one that I wanted to share a day like this with. She was the one I wanted others to look at as she walked down the aisle to meet me and feel overjoyed with emotions. I don't enjoy making people cry but in this case I think it is warranted. The very next day I went out looking for an engagement ring, I scoured everywhere I could and went looking for the perfect ring. When I finally found it I knew it was meant to be and I could not be happier to give it to her. Fast forward a little bit of time and we are as happy as could be, planning our special day. In my head I keep that special day in the back of my mind, the day I knew I wanted to share the rest of my life with my significant other. It may have started like any other day but it will never be that for me. It may another day or just another wedding to others but it will always be much more for me. And I'll always know the reasons why.",3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RYWXALT,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RYWXALT
