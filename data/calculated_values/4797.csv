The surf forecast was clean and 1-2 feet surf with offshore winds.  The kids are excited about going.  It been flat for a few weeks now.  My wife was looking forward to going to our usual spot to do some beach combing for sharks teeth.  When we arrived at the beach, we laid our belonging down on the sand.  It was perfect.  The surf looked fun!  It was a perfect day for the girls to continue learning how to surf.  I paddled out with the children to the outside.  We sat there a bit and watch the sets go by.  The girls were surprised by a pod of dolphins swimming by.  After waiting for several minutes, a nice set of waves was heading towards the beach.  We all began paddling as hard and fast as we could towards the beach.  I had both of my daughter on each side of me.  I could feel the wave take me and my long board.  As I popped up, I looked to my left and to my right.  I saw my girls standing on their boards at the same time.  Once they began riding the wave, I saw the smiles on their faces.  It was priceless!  Seeing them stoked made me so happy.  I knew what they were feeling, only a surfer would know.",3QBD8R3Z225HKD5POZO23VLL37TO4Y,3QBD8R3Z225HKD5POZO23VLL37TO4Y
