I'm finally having a baby! I'm so excited to be finally be able to be a mom. You don't know how long I've waited for this moment. The baby is kicking inside me and I feel its every movement. It's great but at the same time a weird feeling. Would I be a good mom, I wondered to myself. I hope I can live up to be a great mother! It's a great feeling but at the same time it's scary. I don't know if I'm ready to be a mom yet. It's both exciting and scary at the same time. I don't know if that makes sense or not. But at least I won't have to go through this alone. I will have my husband there, helping me along the whole way. Thinking about that makes me feel a lot calmer.",,32ZKVD547G9CJNXCKGEXN6TGGRC3BM
