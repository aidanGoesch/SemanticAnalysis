I dialed 911 when I really smelled smoke strongly, but it took the fire department a very long time to get to our house. Due to this, almost everything was completely tarnished. I was completely devastated that I lost everything, but I retained the most important thing, and that is my family. I just cannot believe that this happened to us. The fire department later told us that it was due to a gas leak inside the house. If not for our smoke detectors, we would all almost certainly be dead. It is a horrifying thing to think about. Since then, I have encouraged all my friends to check smoke detector batteries. It is nothing to fool around with. I am trying to have an outlook on this event in a positive manner, and so far it has really been changing my life for the better. I am more faithful, I care more about others, I am more empathetic, and i have even started going to Church more. My family has begun the process of building a new house with the insurance money from the old house that burnt down. I am still extremely upset that i lost all of my possessions, but i have realized that family is far more important. I thank God every day that I am still here on earth. When the fire happened, we still barely made it out despite the detectors going off. My father even had to run through a flaming doorway before the fire department got there. It was simply a horrifying event that I would never wish upon anyone. We are all trying to turn our lives around.",,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4
