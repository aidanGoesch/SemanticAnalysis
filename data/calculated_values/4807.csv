My husband is a state legislator, and he was invited to attend a conference in the Atlantic Beach area. The lobbying organization sponsoring the conference paid for our hotel room at an upscale resort. They also paid for all our room service. Because my husband was scheduled to go golfing with some of the members of the lobbying group, he decided to treat me to a day at the spa that is located within the resort. I booked three separate services, including a massage, a mani/pedi, and a body scrub treatment. The spa itself was serene and beautiful. It was decorating in white and soothing light blue colors. I have degenerative arthritis in my back so I have to use a wheelchair often, which makes me feel self-conscious, but everyone at the spa was kind and accommodating. Finally it was time for my hot stone massage. The massage therapist was a man, who I will call Paul for purposes of this story. Paul also gave me my body scrub. We had an intersting conversation about global poverty, and Paul told me about his life and his son. He is originally from France and has a number of unique hobbies and interests. I felt comfortable with Paul until the massage began. Throughout the massage, I had the feeling that he was being inappropriate with me in terms of  how and where he was touching me. He pressed his groin area against my hand. He rubbed my inner thigh with one of the hot stones, even grazing over my underwear. I have had massages before, and they are generally systematic and organized. This massage felt  haphazard and improvised. Paul seemed to be concentrating his efforts on my intimate areas. I grew stiff and just wished for the massage to be over with. I don't know why I didn't say anything or ask to stop the massage. When the massage was over, I told my husband what happened, and he was calm and logical in his response, which made me feel better. In the end, I couldn't decide if Paul had been inappropriate or if I was imagining things.",3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B5T5U,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B5T5U
