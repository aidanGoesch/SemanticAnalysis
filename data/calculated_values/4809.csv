We rented a rustic beach house in Lincoln. The beach house sat high above the ocean with a set of stairs that lead down to the beach. Our mornings were filled with coffee and relaxing on our deck or in the hot tub overlooking the water. Then followed a morning walk along the beach looking for seashells.      In the afternoons we enjoyed playing board games and sometimes took a nap. In the evenings we would make a scrumptious dinner, return to stroll along the water while watching the sunsets, and then again to the hot tub with a glass of wine. We watched movies in the evenings.      The only disappointing part of the trip is how we did not get much sunshine. We had quite a bit of drizzly rain. However you can't expect anything different on the Oregon Coast that time of year.      I really enjoy having a niece and nephew who are twins. They are each other's best friends and are the kindest, most thoughtful kids I know. They have brought much joy to our family. This was a special vacation I will remember for the rest of my life.",,3QEMNNSB2YLNZ3WJ0O8TVDTWPAT7DE
