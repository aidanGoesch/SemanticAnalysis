My wife and I had traveled for the first time together.  I have been to Las Vegas twice before but she had never been.  She was in awe at how different things were compared to where we are from (Hawaii).  We had a great time seeing all the lights and people and going to the attractions.  I am very pleased at our experience there.  We will definitely need to go back another time.  Possibly do a road trip the next time we visit the states as we are from and isolated island in the Pacific.  My wife and I need to travel more often but it is very expensive to live in our state and can only make what it takes to survive out here.  I would like to be able to travel much more often than we currently do.  Hopefully next year we can either travel back to the states or to another country.  That is what is on my bucket list, to visit another country.  One thing,  I need to get a passport first.  I hear that it can be difficult to get if you dont know what to bring.  I will need to research to be fully prepared for the situation.",3QEMNNSB2YLNZ3WJ0O8TVDTWQVA7D2,3QEMNNSB2YLNZ3WJ0O8TVDTWQVA7D2
