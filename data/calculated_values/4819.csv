It all started with my parents. They originally decided to move to Texas in 8 months and we planned around that date. However, at some point they decided that they had to move sooner. They said it was because of an offer they got on their house and they really didn't want to miss the opportunity to sell above market value. The problem is this was a very difficult position for me because I was budgeting to have enough money to move in eight months. When they moved up the date, I began panicking because I would not be able to afford to move to Texas with them and I would have no where to live if I stayed here. The whole situation turned out to be a really big strain not just on me but on my relationship with my parents. Having no choice but to move with them in a month and a half turned my life upside down. I turned to a friend of mine who I knew I could trust and I asked them what I should do. My friend told me I should make a decision based on reason and logic. He suggested I write down a list of all of the options I have and the pros and cons of each. That way, I could visualize the problem and have a better chance of making the right choice. By approaching it like a math problem and adding up the option with the most pros, I was able to make an informed decision. Even after using this strategy, I still took several nights to sleep on my decision just to make sure it was what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to move with my parents and leave everything behind for a fresh start in Texas.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C72DE4F9
