I objected and wanted to stay where we currently lived so I asked how long I would have to save up money. They told me it would be 8 months from now so I figured I would have plenty of time to save up money and find a place to live. About a month later they up and decided that it was time to move now. This gave me only an additional 2 weeks to figure something out. I was left in a panic. I only had about 600$ to my name and nowhere to live. Being who I am, I'm very reluctant to ask for help so when it came down to it I had to break my stubbornness. I started reaching out to my friends from all aspects of my life. The most promising one was a good friend of mine that I played fighting games with. He said he had a cheap room and it was small but it was promised to someone else who he thought mike flake on the deal. Unfortunately I never heard from him after that. Another Idea I had involved renting a place with 2 of my close friends as we had talked about it before. Sadly in this situation I found out that one of them didn't have enough money saved yet and the other was taking care of his sick father so that was out of the equation. Luckily one of the people that I hadn't even contacted offered me a very reasonably priced place to live so I ended up moving there. I was very jaded with my parents for putting me in this situation but since I've come to terms with it. I still appreciate all they've done for me and I hope they have a happy retirement.",3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C72DE4F9,
