As you know I've been staying with my parents and starting to save up money. This was because they told me they plan to move to Texas next year. That's fine, it gives me plenty of time to get caught up, get my finances in order and find a place to move to because I have no intention on moving to Texas with them. That's just too fa away from my current life and I'm not willing to just start over yet. Now here comes the part that just left me angry and jaded for a very long time. About 2 months ago they (and by they I mean my mother and my dad didn't stop her) decided to move the move date up to June 15th. That means my timeline for saving money went from having 8 months and magically dropped down to about a month and a half. Needless to say I was livid. I started to work as much overtime and stay up late hours doing additional work at home because I was in full panic mode and I couldn't afford to not be working around the clock. Now, we get to a few days before June 15th, she's rushing me to get packed and moved out so I disused moving in with one of my friends and he agreed. The 14th we move everything over there and I'm basically done. Still really mad but relieved to have the situation behind me. But it doesn't end there... in all that rushing and we're moving now and you have to go they neglected to tell me something. It turned out that the 15th was NOT when I had to leave. They ended up staying in the house for an entire extra month before they finally moved out and headed to Texas.  I was so mad when one of them said ""No son, we're still here"" I almost hung up the phone immediately. To this day I'm still salty about the whole thing but I've at least gotten over it for the most part. I do miss them a lot and have warmed up to calling them again. Well, sorry I haven't written in a while diary, I'll try to get back to it more often   Ciao!",3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C72DE4F9,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C72DE4F9
