I was very happy that day because everything felt so perfect in a sense that everyone was definitely having fun. When me and my husband arrived I was greeted by my Mother. She immediately showed her newly done dentures and she was very ecstatic to show me because I was the one who recommended the dentist. She hugged my and my husband so tightly and when she saw her grandsons she jumped like she's not 60 years old. I went to the back and I saw my Father. I was very happy again to see him because even if I visit him most of the time, I feel like I don't see him that much often. He hugged my and offered me some beer. He was also prepare the barbecue when I saw him. I called my husband to let him help my dad prepare the meats and fries and some other BBQ goodness. My brothers arrive and my sister in laws by the time it was dinner, I was very happy seeing my nephew because he got sooo much taller, almost close to my height now. When the fireworks started around 9pm, everyone was already a bit slightly drunk. My husband always takes care of the fireworks. Luckily he didn't buy the illegal ones and he only got to use the safer ones this time. I still get to smile when I remember my mom showing me her new dentures.",3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C739WF4V,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C739WF4V
