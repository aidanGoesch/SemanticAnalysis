I don't mind admitting it because I know it's a taboo topic and just talking about it might help someone.  I want to help as many people as I can with my story.  I started using as a teen.  I had a bad home life and somehow fell into a bad crowd.  I was at a party with my best friend when she offered me some pills.  I didn't want to look like a loser, especially since she was a little bit older.  So, I took a pill and my whole life changed after that.  I was pretty much hooked from then on.  My substance abuse got worse as I dabbled into other drugs.  I lost so much weight ended up homeless.  I had hit rock bottom when I ran into my favorite high school teacher on the street.  I was so embarrassed of how I looked and how I had nothing to show for my life.  She offered me a place to stay in order to get my life together.  I took her up on the offer just because of the embarrassment and she really helped me change my life.  I consider her a mother figure now and I can't imagine life without her.  I don't want to think of where I would be without her.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7ALBF45
