Even on the phone, which I normally hate. We agreed to go out for dinner, already 2 days after starting to talk. He wanted to show me his house, so I drove to his place. After talking for a bit, I drove us to the restaurant. We had a lovely italian dinner in a nice setting. We shared a bottle of wine. There was a piano player which I enjoyed. When we got back to his house, he asked if I wanted to come in. I was a little hesitant, but agreed as I didn't want the night to end yet. We started to watch a movie, and he fell asleep. We cuddled for a while, but I decided to leave as I didn't want him to want to hook up with me. Later on he told me that he never expected to hook up with me that night. I was really impressed with how the date went. He was a great guy and we met again 2 days later.",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSC5T1EQ0
