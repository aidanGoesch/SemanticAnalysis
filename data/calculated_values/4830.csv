It was about one month ago that I was preparing to go on vacation with my fiance. We had been jointly planning this vacation for about a year at that point. I couldn't wait to start this vacation. I was experiencing a lot of stress from work at that time. We decided to visit Hersheypark in Hershey Pennsylvania. We chose this place because we wanted to experience an area different from California and my fiance understood that I have been a huge fan of the Hershey Chocolate Company since I was a child. I think the Hershey Chocolate Company and it's products are magical and couldn't wait to arrive. When we arrived we immediately got on the SooperDooperLooper and the Wildcat. Both of these rides were really scary and fun. We then took a break from the rides and visited a picnic area. My fiance surprised me by secretly planning a catering service to provide us with food in this picnic area. I then begged him to go to the ZooAmerica part of the park. I really wanted to see the Southern Swamps section of ZooAmerica. I am a big fan of the barred owl and the roseate spoonbill. I started to get tired and I just wanted to go back to our room at this point. However, my fiance said he had one more surprise for me. He took me to this ride called the Kissing Tower. It gives you a a panoramic view of Hershey through windows shaped like a Hershey's Kiss. I was highly impressed since he knows that is my favorite Hershey's candy and the views from the tower were very romantic at night. I was startled we he began to get down on one knee and present me with a ring in a special Hershey Kiss box. I started to shake and tremble before eventually saying yes. I had never felt more surprised or loved then at that moment. I still can't believe he gave me the most surprising moment ever in Hersheypark of all places! I couldn't think of a more magical vacation or proposal then what I received that night.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7B62F43
