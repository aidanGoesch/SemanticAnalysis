It just felt like I was going through the motions. Finding the motivation to go to church was a real struggle. In fact, I had missed church multiple times over the summer. But, a couple of weeks ago, I decided it was time to snap out of it. I set my alarm extra early. I prayed that I would feel refreshed. I also prayed that I would stay awake and really absorb the message. And I am glad that I did. It ended up being a very powerful service. The message was all about finding our calling. And they had a volunteer fair after the service. I felt like God was really talking to me. I decided to volunteer to work with one of the youth programs. I started it last week, and am already in love with it. The kids are great and I feel like I am making a difference. I feel like my prayers were really answered.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7BAFF4O
