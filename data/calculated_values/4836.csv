I really didn't feel like going to church and seriously considered not going, but I somehow mustered up the energy to drive down to church. After getting to church, I sat in my car for a moment and prayed that I wouldn't fall asleep, and that I would gain something valuable out of the service despite being so tired. I went to go get the pre-service coffee, and the lead pastor somehow saw me and immediately recognized me as someone who hadn't been to the church before. He came over to talk to me and we chatted for a while, and he introduced me to several people. One of the people he introduced me to was someone who was a researcher at the university I would start attending in the next 3 weeks, and had personal connections with the people I wanted to be my PI. The pastor then connected me with a young peoples group that was meeting that night, and I said I would go. He then gave me his personal cell phone number so he could connect me with more people. After that, I went into the sanctuary and sat near the back. The pastor then came up to me about 5 minutes later and asked if I would sit with him today, as he wasn't giving the sermon. I said yes, for some reason, and so I went and sat with the lead pastor at a church in the front row. I definitely did not fall asleep that service. At the end of the service, they made an announcement that they were looking for volunteers to help with the audio mixing of the band and the technical support for the service. This is pretty much a job description of my previous job which I held for the past 3 years, so I was a perfect fit. I went up after the service and said I would be willing to volunteer. God answered all of my prayers that day, and He did it within 2 hours.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7BAFF4O
