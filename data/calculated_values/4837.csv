It was me and 4 of my best friends. We were so excited to go on the cool rides and eat all the circus junk food. We got there and the lines were long for the entry. Finally we paid and got in. We heard all the sounds of people screaming on the rides and children playing and sounds of game machines dinging all over the place. We decided to go on the scary rides first before we ate anything. Afterwards we gorged on cakes, cotton candy and caramel popcorn. We had so much fun! The n we decided to go on a few more rides again because they were so much fun. We went on a ride that brought us hundreds of feet in the air and then dropped us and we fell almost crashing into the ground. OMG! That was the scariest ride ever! After many hours we finally decided to go home. But in the car ride home I got very nauseous and wound up vomiting in a plastic bag. But it was so fun none the least and I would do it again!",,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXGEMLB3
