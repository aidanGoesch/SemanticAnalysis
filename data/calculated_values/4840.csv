I was going on a trip.  It was out of the country.  I had never been out of the country before.  I was going to South America.  I was nervous too.  Even though I wanted to go, I kept wondering if I would fit in in South America.  When I went there, I was pleasantly surprised.  Everyone was so nice.  I ended up learning a lot about South American culture.  I went to many of the country's museums.  I learned so much about ancient civilizations and how they lived.  I was shocked about how much I did not know.  I ate South American food.  I was delighted to find out that their food was even more delicious than my country's.  I had a fun time.",,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXH7KLBO
