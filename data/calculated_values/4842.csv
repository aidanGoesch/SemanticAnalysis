I went to the country of Peru, to visit Machu Picchu which was located in Cusco. For this trip, I went with my older brother, who is as adventurous as I am. When we got the city of Cusco, we learn that people drank this coca tea to prevent altitude sickness since the highly city was elevated.  From our stay there, we visited the ancient Inka's ruin and we learnt about their lifestyle back them. They were free people who enjoyed their land and the fauna and flora that were on earth. We learn that they believe in multiple Gods and have done sacrifices in the past for their Gods.  They spoke the language Quechua . They were conquer by the Spaniards  and forced into Catholicism. It was a remarkable experience to have learn from such powerful civilization from the past.  Their architecture was very impressive. It was done all by man power with huge rocks that you couldn't even imagine how to stack them without technology.  We also got to eat their popular dishes called Lomo Saltado and aji a la Huancaina. They are also know for their ceviche mixto and cuy dish ( guinea pig). This experience was memorable because it was out of what I am normally used to.  I got to spend time with my older brother and share memorable experiences that will last.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXH7KLBO,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXH7KLBO
