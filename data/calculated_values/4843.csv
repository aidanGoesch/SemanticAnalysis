My favorite pet ever, Ashton, passed away from old age. Her vet said it was likely to happen this year but still I was not prepared mentally for this. She was the best possible cat ever, and everyone I know absolutely adored her. She would always rub up against other people's legs when the came to my house. And boy did she ever love her tuna! Despite owning more than 10 cats in my life, I have never seen another cat as social as Ash was. It's truly a huge loss for me and my family. My grand daughters especially loved playing with her when they came over to visit. Thankfully I will always have the images and videos of her running around and being hilarious, but it's not quite enough. I know some people have asked me if I will be getting another cat to keep me company, and I'm not sure. In some ways I cannot imagine having a cat who is better than Ash. Or maybe I just need some time to pass so I am not so emotional. It's been more than two months and I'm still struggling to hold back tears over it. What a wonderful cat who lived a wonderful life!",,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXIVELBV
