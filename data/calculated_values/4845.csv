My story actually begins on July 3, 2017. I was scanning through Craig’s list, when I saw this video of this little guy. He was cream colored and his 11 other siblings were playing boisterously on top of him. Next scene, there he was again, everyone piled on top of him. Instantly I knew, he is the one. My husband and I took home home, it cost us $60 and he came completely full with fleas!I called the vet and begin my monumental task of getting rid of the fleas. It was very tedious, and time consuming. We called him Ash, after the Pokemon master, my children favorite show. I taught him to sit, roll over, high fives, shake hands and we played hide and seek for hours. He was very energetic and frisky. He would run over to me from wherever, when I said the word,  “ready”. He rushed over to watch me unplug the sink after dishwashing and watch the water swirl down the drain. He followed me everywhere! He was precious, my companion.   I was on vacation in London for my son’s graduation when that horrific call came. It was 100 degrees.  My other son called frantically that Ashton is at the vet. My heart was racing, when he told us that he had severe urinary  tract problem and kidney disease. He might not survive. Few hours later he was gone. Just gone. I cried and grieved for days, and could not stop talking about him. I looked at all his pictures, and videos. He was supposed to be with us for another 10 years.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXIVELBV,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXIVELBV
