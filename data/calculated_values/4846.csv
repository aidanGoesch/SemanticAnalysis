I pause for a second just to think back to someone that was with me for what felt like such a short time. People or animals come into our lives and leave us as well pretty normally but few are truly special. That brings me to why I feel like I do today. Around two months ago I lost my friend someone close and I loved. It was my companion dog Buddy, the best dog a person could every have. Buddy was brought into my life from love and at a time when I needed him the most. He was caring and loving and was always by my side, loyal in every way possible. I needed him the most when he came to me to pull me back to happiness. He came to me and even though it was brief he lead me back to happiness. I don't know if I just got lucky to have him but he made an impact in my life that I have rarely felt. As I reflect back now in a state of sadness I am also happy. I know that sounds strange but I am happy because I knew him but sad because I lost him as well. I can only thank the lord for bringing him to me and showing me that I can be okay. So tonight I will drink to my friend Buddy, lost but never forgotten. This two months have been hell but memories will get me through, thank you Buddy I will never forget you.",,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXJX8BLK
