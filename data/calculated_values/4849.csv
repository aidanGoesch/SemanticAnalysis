She was found on her apartment floor. She had a lot of health issues due to the way she lived her life. Smoking and drinking throughout most of it. We never had the type of relationship I wanted but I am learning to be more at peace with it now.  When I first found out I was upset but I was still felt ok. Then I talked to my brother on the phone and next think I know I was talking weird. My blood pressure spiked I was having a panic attack. My fiance rushed home to find me on the floor. She wanted me to go to the hospital but I could not do it. I pleaded with her not to go just let me lay. I did lay down and was able to calm myself. I scheduled a doctors appt to get some medicine to help me cope. I know am finally learning to be at peace with it and putting more time into my relationship with my 4 year old son. My mothers passing is behind me and I can move on. May she rest in peace with my father.,3QILPRALQ6H0LTSFZNE25I1LGLVN85,
