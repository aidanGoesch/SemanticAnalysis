It was unexpected and affected me a lot more than I thought. I remember going into her place with my sibling to clear out belongings. We were not as close and I regret not being there for her in her untimely death. I started having anxiety attacks shortly after. I couldn't even be around people talking about her without freaking out. I soon after got help and started processing my grief properly. The main thing I can say is there is always help for whatever you are going through; You have to find the strength to be proactive and find it. This event happened 6 months ago. We always butted heads and didn't see eye to eye. I regret some things I said to her in the past and how I pushed her away. I wish she got to see my son more than what she did. No matter how much I regret certain things I try to remember our good moments together. She meant well at heart and I hope she found peace. It is never easy losing a loved one.,3QILPRALQ6H0LTSFZNE25I1LGLVN85,3QILPRALQ6H0LTSFZNE25I1LGLVN85
