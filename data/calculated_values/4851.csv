I realized one day he was acting strange, meowing a lot, not running around, etc. I took him to the vet to get him checked out. This was one of those lucky coincidences or fate, or whatever you want to call it, because the vet told me within like 20 minutes of checking on him, that had I brought him in even a few days later, he wouldn't have had a chance. They told me he needed surgery and it was a medical emergency. I was not expecting a surgery bill in my budget, but I had to do it for my cat. They took him in, told me to go out and get some lunch, run some errands, and they'd call me when finished. While I was out, all I could think about was surgery complications. I've had this cat since I was a kid. This was the first time I'd ever had to take him to the vet, so I never imagined he'd be so sick since he never was before. I called my mom and dad, told them what was going on, tried to get comoforted a bit. 3 hours later, I get a call to come back to the vet. They told me the surgery was successful and he'll be fine. They had to put a urinary catheter in and that was a big reason he was saved. I was given medicine to put in his food and told to keep an eye on him. I was so happy he was ok.",,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B
