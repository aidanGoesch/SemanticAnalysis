I had just gotten home from a trip to New York at around 1:00 in the morning.  My sister had texted me earlier that day saying my our cat, Nyx, had been squatting as if he were straining.  At the time, I thought Nyx was a female cat and assumed it was most likely a urinary tract infections since blockages were rare in females.  I told her I would take Nyx to the vet the next day.  When I got home, Nyx was laying on his side almost lifeless and barely moving.  Out of concern, I felt his bladder and it was very hard.  Realizing that Nyx was actually blocked, I woke my dad and sister up and said that we need to go to MedVet immediately because he probably wasn't going to make it until our regular vet opened.  We rushed him to the closest animal hospital and the vet techs immediately took him to the back room.  I felt terrified that he was going to die.  When the veterinarian informed us that Nyx was actually a male cat, I felt angry that the shelter we got him from misinformed me.  I would have told me sister to take Nyx to the vet when she first texted me if I had known that Nyx was a male cat.  I knew blockages were more likely to occur in males and I wouldn't have risked his life by telling her to wait until I got home.     On top of feeling terrified Nyx is going to die, I was also very anxious about the financial cost.  My dad was very kind and offered to help me pay for it, so that help me a bit more relief.  The veterinarian said that Nyx's urethral passage was so unusually narrow that the vet techs were having trouble placing a urinary catheter in to drain his bladder.  If they couldn't place a urinary catheter, then the prognosis was not going to be good for Nyx.  While we could afford temporary care until we got Nyx to his regular vet when they opened, we could not afford to pay for a surgery at the animal hospital.  The whole situation felt hopeless to me.  I felt very anxious and I was shaking the entire time until I learned that they finally managed to place the urinary catheter.  I was finally able to go home and sleep for a couple of hours.       As soon as Nyx's regular vet opened, I picked up Nyx from the animal hospital and felt so relieved that he looked a little more lively.  His regular vet told us he would likely need surgery to widen his urethra in order to prevent this from happening again.  Nyx ended up staying the rest of the weekend at the regular vet before coming home with me.  Overall, the whole experience was terrifying, upsetting, and made me feel anxious.",3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B
