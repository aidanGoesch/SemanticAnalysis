I cannot hear ever since I was a baby. I grew up with difficulties because I could not be taught like other kids in school. I had to attend a special needs school where I was taught through sign language. Fortunately, I can speak, so responding in school wasn't a problem. The biggest problem for me is not being able to have a normal social life. Most of the people I know, including my friends and family don't have the same problem so it's not easy for them to adapt to me when I'm around. It kills me when I see them laughing at a joke that I did not hear. Whenever I am with other people, I cannot help but feel inferior. I recently talked about it with one of my friends and she told that they try to make sure that I am included but sometimes involuntarily end up forgetting that some one with special needs is around. Moreover, having this disability as a woman is very hard. Other than not having a meaningful social life, my dating life has been hell. I can hardly ever connect with anyone. For someone to date me, they would need to be fluent in sign language and willing to use it all the time to talk to me. It's also worth noting that it's hard to express emotions through sign language so it's hard for me to have an emotional connection with a partner. Most of my partners just end up leaving because my life situation is too much for them to endure.",,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ
