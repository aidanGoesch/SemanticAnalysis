I also heard stories in person from friends about what they did over the weekend with other friends. Not once the entire holiday season was I invited to any of these events despite the fact that mutual friends were all included. I realize that I become quite a hermit during the winter months so I don't typically do much but it would be nice to at lease be given the option of going. December was relatively mild compared to previous years so I might have done more if I had been given the option. I'm sure that if my friends heard me talking this way, they would make excuses like ""we didn't want to just have you watch us skate"" or ""we know how cold you get outside"" or ""we know you need to be careful about germs."" The problem is, no one asked and gave me the choice to decide for myself. They made the decision for me that the event was something I wouldn't want to do. I often become a little down during the winter months and this is the exact reason why. I sit in my house for weeks at a time without any contact with people (besides my daughter and home care workers) other than Facebook. It makes me feel really frustrated and lonely. People often say ""well, you should plan something"" or ""invite people over."" I do those things but I don't feel like I should always have to initiate social events especially when there are events going on that are already planned. During the winter months, my days are nearly exactly the same each day. I get up, work, take care of my daughter, and go to bed. I really have very little to look forward to except spring. Yes, spring, that season that is still months away.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ,
