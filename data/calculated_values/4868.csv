Everyone started off outside which was great. We all ate and had a good time. The kids were playing and running amok. However, later, all the adults went in and left me outside with the kids because there were stairs to get into the house. I felt pretty annoyed and frustrated. They -all- know I'm in a wheelchair so why would they invite me over if they were going to go inside at some point knowing I can't go in too. I really think I'm just not going to go over there for anymore stuff. It made me feel like total crap. Later on, they all came back out because Katie basically made them. It was the world-wide annual candle-lighting at sundown and I had told her I would only come if we could light our candles there. She explained what we were doing and we took a picture for the website. None of them really get it, though. It's a nice to honor my friends and I as survivors and remember those who have died. To them, it was really a big deal. Whatever. I'm done with them.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ
