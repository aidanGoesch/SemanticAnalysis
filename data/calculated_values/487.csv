I love to say that that event was about me. Three months ago i married to my best friend and i am very happy with my decision. My wedding was held in india because my whole family is living there. All ceremonies were as per indian rituals. Mostly my all cousins were attended my wedding and it was a first wedding in my family after so many years. It was 4 days wedding ceremony. first day was called mehndi ceremony. The second day was haldi ceremony. Third day was a musical night and the last one is a wedding night. There were around 1000 people on my wedding night. My all near and dear perform dance for me. Everyone did something and something for me. So many people gifted gold to me and my husband. People shower blessings on us.,,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSC5ULQEY
