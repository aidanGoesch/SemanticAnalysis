She has a temper issue and is a drama queen. Unfortunately I didn't walk away like I should have and I hit her back. My other sister called the police. She claims I hit her too but I did not. I was the one who was arrested and went to jail. It was pure hell for 24 hours. I went to court and the judge said I couldn't live in my house anymore because it's too close to the ""scene of the crime"". This all happened at my parents house next door to me. I was so upset and crying by the time I got home. For some reason my keys wouldn't fit in the door so I thought my landlord locked me out. By then I was so distressed I wanted to kill myself. I thought of many ways to do it. But then I thought of my mom and my cats and had the sense to drive myself to the hospital. I was treated there for a couple days on suicide watch then transferred to a behavioral health center where I stayed for five days. They put me on anxiety medicine which helped tremendously. This was an absolute horrible ordeal I went through and I'm still going through it for the next year. I have to see a probation officer every month, pay court costs, pay the health center and I can't afford it all. I'm on social security. I can hardly wait for this nightmare to be over with.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87MYIME2,
