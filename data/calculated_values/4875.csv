She hit me in the face and we ended up fighting. I should have just walked away because what happened in the next few months has left a huge scar on me. She and my other sister called the police and they arrested me. She hit me first but they arrested me. It was a horrific ordeal when I was in jail for 24 hours. I've had several court appearances since. After one appearance I was so upset and distraught I wanted to kill myself. The urge was so strong but I thought of my mom and my cats and drove myself to the hospital. My heart was pounding so hard they thought I had a problem with it. I couldn't stop crying either. I was on suicide watch for two days. Then they transferred my to a behavioral health center where I spent the next five days. I was put on anxiety medication and felt better. After I was discharged I went to therapy classes. Now I'm on probation for two years and owe thousands of dollars I don't have to the court, the hospital and the behavior center. I'm on social security and cant keep up with my bills. It's hard and it really stresses me out big time. So for the next two years it'll be very hard on me. I don't miss my sisters at all. I will never ever see them for the rest of my life because I want nothing to do with them because of what they put me through. They have no clue what it's like for me. My life is forever changed. I also lost my husband to a sudden heart attack four years ago and they have no clue how hard that's been on me too.  But I get by with the love of my mom and my cats.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87MYIME2,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87MYIME2
