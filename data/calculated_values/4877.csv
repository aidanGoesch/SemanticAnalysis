They told me about a place but told me to not go at that time because it was dangerous at night. They told me that I should go during the day. They told me to there was a hotel close by. I was dressed in a way that made me look poor and even though one of the guys that was there did not know me he offered to give me a ride. He was very kind and empathic during the ride. He thought that I could get lost and that because it was at night and I was in a strange country it could be dangerous. I was a bit surprised that he would do it as people fear strangers. It was dark out, the zone did not look that good and that made it more surprising that he would want to help me at his risk. I think most people would not have chosen to help me in that case. It thought that it was a very selfless act. It might be little but to me that meant a lot that he would go out of his way to help me not knowing who I was. It surprised and impacted me. I felt hopeful. I think about it from time to time.",,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87VS3EMC
