My brother is a soccer player. About 2 weeks ago I watched my brother play soccer. Not just any soccer. He made his soccer debut in Honduras. This was the best thing that ever happened to me. I was elated. I was excited not only for me but for him. My brother has struggled to become one of the best soccer players since the age of 4. He did it! I'm very proud to call him my brother. I am slightly younger than he is. I'm well on my way to become a soccer star too. I hope that I'm next to follow in his footsteps. I was to play in other countries too. Overall, him playing in Honduras was elating!",,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLCNP
