This was just an amazing time. The team was so nice and treated me like family. The coach took me out to dinner at a nice restaurant in Tegucigalpa the capital of Honduras. I was able to have some of the team members show me around town. we visited some awesome museums. Then on that Saturday I got to watch them play in the National Stadium. My brother was in the starting line up for the first time and made his international debut. The game was an amazing experience. At half time I was able to go down on the pitch and watch the game at half time. They won the game 3-2. The game was a  great battle back and forth, My brother had an assist and almost scored. After the game we went to a famous restaurant to celebrate the win. It was sad to leave on Sunday and come back to states. I hope to travel down again to watch him and the team play this year.  It was one of the best experiences in my life.",3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLCNP,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLCNP
