We start to feel unfulfilled, under-valued, and that we are not using all of our skills we spent so long honing for the workplace. This happened to me about 3 months ago, where I completely hit a wall in my job at the time. I had been working as a Staff Accountant for a nationwide retail pharmacy chain for about 4 years. I took the job right out of college and thought it would be great. It was a huge company so I knew my job would be stable, and if I wanted to move around a bit I figured that I would be able to. Well, after 4 years of small raises and no real big opportunities, I decided that it was time to chase my passion and look for new work about 3 months ago. I was such a small cog in this company since it was massive so I felt that my work was not meaningful. A family friend of mine had recently started a job in sales at a very small board company responsible for some big hit games, and they were looking to fill out their accounting department. Taking this job would be a risk, but board gaming is something I am passionate about and this company was so small. Anything I did in that job would be noticed by everyone. I would be making a real impact in my work. I decided to throw caution to the wind, and apply for the job. I've now been here for 2 months and I love it. The work I do is meaningful, I care about my company, and I am excited to come in to work each and every day. I am so happy I took this risk and chased my passion and left my dead end job. If anyone ever feels stuck at work, it is always worth it to chase your dreams. I know from experience now.",,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLNC0
