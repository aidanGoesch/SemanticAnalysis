They were so excited to venture off and hang out in a different state. I'm sure it seemed like it was way longer than that and that my brother and sister could not wait until the visit was over. At one point, it got very ugly between my daughter and her Aunt and Uncle. If they did not live so far away, I would have made sure to get my kids home sooner rather than just let them stay the entire duration of a week and a half. However, these plans were already made and I did not have the time away from work to go get them. I asked my brother and sister what happened and they explained to me that she was sneakily trying to meet up with boys over the internet. Of course I spoke to my daughter for her side of the story, to which she denied. She did not know that my sister took a photo of the chatting exchange she had on her internet browser. I always advised my daughter that if she ever comes into a situation where she does not agree with something, that she needs to take a moment and collect herself. Take a few deep breaths, gather her thoughts. Be open to what the other person may be thinking. Try to understand the situation and then offer your two cents. You will not get anywhere when you act upon emotions in a very tense situation. My sister and brother tried to explain the dangers of this and my daughter wanted to react out of anger and saying how her Aunt and Uncle does not want her to have any fun. It was unfortunate that this trip went south and full of tension.",,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X45A2NCS
