It was a long awaited trip and a lot of planning had gone into it because of the international travel involved. There was much excitement at the prospect of being exposed to a new culture, meeting new people and of course, the exotic destination. I had always been fascinated by Jamaican music and food but there’s something surreally authentic about experiencing these aspects directly in the native country and I just couldn’t wait for the plane to land in Montego Bay... woo hoo! As we checked into the hotel set in the midst of Palm trees and shimmering water, Dad winked at my brother and me, and told us to meet him and mom at the pool. My brother and I exchanged a knowing glance- it was a family tradition. Every year we voted on our vacation destination and upon getting there we planned our activities for the stay. Our folks encouraged us to steer clear of the usual touristy stuff and come up with novel ways to interact with the locals..... andddd this time I already knew what I wanted to do. Last year, after the trip was finalized, as part of a school project we were asked to make a pen pal from across the globe, and no prizes for guessing, I chose Jamaica, and hard as it is to fathom, Aiesha has become my best friend. The bond that forged between us through the exchange of snail mail and this trip planned to her hometown seemed like the most wonderful of synchronicity! Everyone except for my brother was excited when I suggested we visit Aiesha at her school but it was my mom’s idea to bring supplies to the local school which in retrospect turned out to be a lesson I will never forget. After the initial yawn-yawn, my brother got into it and we really enjoyed shopping for the school supplies. The visit to the local school, meeting Aiesha in person, distribution of the supplies directly to the students and their euphoria at receiving gifts from friends from another country is etched in my mind forever. Words truly cannot capture how happy I was, but it truly was an unforgettable trip!!! Aiesha and my friendship continues to deepen. It’s been 4 months since I met her in Jamaica, and I am over the moon to learn that she and her family are planning a trip the US next year. Can’t wait :)",,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X4F8BNC7
