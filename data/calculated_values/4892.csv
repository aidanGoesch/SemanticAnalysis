After a lengthy and bitter divorce with my now ex-husband, I was very excited to be able to finally plan this trip. We all needed a relaxing break. My children and I were very excited about the trip! Several extended family members ended up coming on vacation with us. They essentially piggy backed on our trip, which was great. Though the trip was meant to be a time for my kids and I to relax and simply enjoy time together, I had heard about other people visiting schools in the area, and bringing along gifts for the school children. I thought that was a great idea and did some research about doing something similar while we were there. I contacted the concierge at the resort we were going to stay at, and she made the necessary arrangements for us to visit a local school. The concierge was nice enough to provide me a list of items the school would need the most. I sent this list to my extended family members who planned to join us on the trip. We all purchased items for the school children (school supplies and toys!) and packed them in our suitcases. I have to say, visiting the school was the highlight of my trip! It was very enriching for my children to see the conditions of the school in Jamaica. I made sure to point out to them all the differences between their school and the school in Jamaica. I think it was a great learning experience for my kids and it was important for them to see how good they have it at home. I definitely feel this visit had a positive impact on my kids, and helped them to appreciate what they have. I would highly recommend this type of experience for anyone going on vacation to a third world country.",,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X4F8BNC7
