She would throw trash around after eating. She would throw clothes everywhere in the house. She wouldn't bathe for weeks at a time. I had to teach her basic hygiene. I said to her if you don't clean up your act, that you are out of the house. The mother agreed. The daughter got her act together and doesn't smell terrible everyday. I am glad I could fix somebodies failings at parenting. We soon had a falling out and I had to leave. I had a good time there but everything good has to come to an end. I hope to find love again in this depressing world of ours. I will someday. I just have to move on. It will be hard to find another.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF03DUON
