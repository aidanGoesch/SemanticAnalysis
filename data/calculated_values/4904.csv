We had such a great time.  We were a good match. It all was going well until his immature 27 year old daughter found out he was dating.  She was spoiled and babied by him and his wife all her life and that has made her a pretty immature, worthless adult.  She calls on purpose to ruin dates and creates nonstop drama.  She texts and calls constantly.  And she is a big drinker.   And when she is in town visiting, he is not even allowed to acknowledge my existence.  She is self obsessed and immature, she likes to control her father and manipulate him to an extreme.  She tells him what to do and how to do it.  He is not man enough to stand up to her and be the adult parent.  It makes life miserable.  It's hard enough with a widower, but the daughter puts the situation over the top.  It is so emotionally hard to deal with because you can't just tell him his daughter is an asshole. You have to put up with it.  But, he makes the problem worse catering to her.  If that obstacle wasnt in the way, things would be so much easier.  I dont expect them to easy with a widower. I decided it is too much for me to have to handle.  She won't leave him alone until she might finally have a boyfriend but no one will want to date someone like her.   Once I got out of the situation, I realized how much stress it was putting on me.  It's nice to not have to listen to a phone constantly going off, or sit there with someone that has a phone in their face all the time.",3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF03DUON,
