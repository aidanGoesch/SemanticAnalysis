I and a few friends attended a party. It was a wild party in a field. This field was out in the middle of nowhere. There was no transportation to or from here. Only by driving there. Anyway, as the party progressed, I met a cute girl while dancing. We went off to talk in the woods, and I lost my friends. Later on, she went to catch up with her friends. I and her had taken some substances she had with her. I started feeling weird, and high. I sat there in the woods till morning. I was confused when I woke up. I decided to never take drugs again. This was a learning experience.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF03EOUI
