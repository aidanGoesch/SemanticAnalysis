Some friends of mine from church stopped by to tell us it was on the way and we should make plans to evacuate. They prayed for us and left. Most of the people in town had evacuated or stayed in a shelter. Not my family and I though. We have been through multiple hurricanes before and none of them had caused significant enough damage to justify leaving the house this time. We unanimously agreed that we would stay in the house and brave this out. Sure enough this turned out to be a category 5. Several hours into the storm, the windows blew out. And with that came flooding indoors. I was starting to wish that I had left, so my family and I are grabbed our most important belongings and put them into a suitcase. The next step was to get up to the car. This was difficult because the driveway was almost completely flooded. Fortunately we made it. My wife steered the car and I was able to push it from the front into the road. When we got to the highway it was raining so hard and obscured my vision. As I was turning a car came out of nowhere and hit the car. The next thing you know I woke up in a hospital. It turned out that I had 2 broken legs but everyone else was OK. Then the nurse came in and told me I had a visitor. It turned out to be my friends from the church. Hey cracked a joke saying that I should have listened to them in the first place but were glad I was OK. They congratulated me on getting my family to safety at least. Next time I'm going to take such warnings seriously. I don't wanna ever experience something like that again.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF0TRUOH
