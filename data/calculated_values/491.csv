It was beautiful, as we had it in a tent overlooking the lake.  My brother had maybe one too many drinks that day.  A waiter came over and asked if he would like a water.  My brother looked at him and told him that he knows when it's okay to quit drinking.  I know he didn't mean anything by it, but the waiter was horrified.  He thought he insulted my brother, when he was simply offering water to everyone on a tray.  My brother didn't mean to be mean.  Several people had already come up to him offering water, so he simply thought it was  hint to quit drinking.  It kind of set the tone for me for the rest of the day though.  I mean, it's been three weeks and I still get embarrassed thinking about that one moment.  One that the waiter has probably forgotten all about.  I won't go back to that restaurant though for a bit.  I wouldn't risk getting the same waiter just in case he would remember.  I don't want anyone to spit in my food if he still holds a grudge.",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCTG9QEI
