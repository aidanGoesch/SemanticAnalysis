I pr pared the whole day for it and i was very tired considering the fact that I was three weeks away from my due date. I struggled to cook and  washed my toddle and waited for the visitors. Then  i had a sharp pain and know it could not wait. I called my husband. He drove home. he found me lying down in pain. he picked me and put me in his car. we drove to the hospital. The nurses took me to the labor section immediately. I was there for a few hours with my husband before we started receiving calls from visitors who were already arriving home. We told them of the developments. At exactly 10:00 pm, i was taken to delivery room. Withing the next 5 minutes, I gave birth to healthy baby boy. My husband was there by my side. The little boy's scream was what took away all my pain. We will be forever be greatful fot this day",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF0TRUOH
