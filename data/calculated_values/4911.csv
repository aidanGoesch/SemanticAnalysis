My sister-in-law told us she was pregnant too! always knew she wanted kids, and even set a goal age for becoming a mother. Before she started trying, she was the person in her friend group, she says, who cautioned others not to wait too long. Having problems conceiving as a young, healthy woman was not something she expected would happen to her. She discusses asking for a family-minded commitment from her boyfriend at a young age. I just found out my sister in law is pregnant too. She is due one month after me. This is my first child and she already has a child. I'm not normally a selfish person but I have to admit I'm a little upset she will give birth so close to me. She is very competitive to begin with and now I feel she'll be competitive with the pregnancy too. Before I even knew she was pregnant, I was mentioning names I like for the baby, and she told me if I use the name grace she won't talk to me. Please help. I feel so guilty because I feel this way. I want to be happy for her but it just seems like she stealing my thunder. I get where you're coming from. My SIL copies everything we do, and she's very egotistical. She's not pregnant yet, which is surprising, because she does whatever we do.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF3MROU0
