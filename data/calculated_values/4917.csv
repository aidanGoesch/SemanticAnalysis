It was a lovely Saturday. It was raining the day before so all of the trees and plants were covered in a nice covering of dew. The leaves were glistening with water and the air was fresh. My husband talked about how much he was looking forward to the day. He had a difficult week but this was curing him. We walked to the main gazebo where we were going to have some berries. Along the way there we saw a few animals. The part was known to have a lot of various animas living there. The biggest animal we saw was a deer. It was with her little doe. The two were munching on some foliage in the distance. We then saw dragonflies near the gazebo. I remember catching them during the summer with my siblings when I was growing up. They bring back fond memories.,,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFT9EOUN
