Two weeks ago, he overdosed on heroin. I knew that he was having trouble with school, but I never would have imagined that he would turn to drugs. I was so scared that my son was going to be dead. I went to his room to deliver some Chinese takeout to him. I knocked on his door a few times but there was no answer. I opened the door and found him almost falling off his bed, vomit spewing from his mouth. I immediately yelled for my husband. I positioned my son's body so that he was lying on his side. My husband came running into my son's room, wondering what was wrong. I told him to dial 911. He stuttered a bit while talking to dispatch, so I just took the phone from him and told them that my son overdosed. Paramedics arrived five minutes later. They tore my son's clothes off and administered the medicine that would save him to his rectum. Color started returning to my son's face as they got him ready to go in the ambulance to the hospital. He cried. The cry was a mix of pain, shock, and shame. He told me he was sorry. I just told him that I loved him and everything was going to be okay. I was told I could follow the ambulance to the hospital. I asked my husband if he was going to get in the car with me, but he didn't respond. Annoyed, I left without him. I watched in my rear-view mirror as he stood in the corner of the garage, wide-eyed. Was it fear? My husband still hasn't talked to me since that night.",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20J1VC90I
