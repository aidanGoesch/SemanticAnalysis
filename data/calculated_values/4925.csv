He was in the hospital due to problems with his legs and congestive heart failure.  He seemed to be doing better than he had been and he was sitting up when we came into the room. and watching a baseball game on TV.  His doctor had actually told him he'd be getting out the next day so he was in a good mood.  I took my 12-year old son with me and he wore a St. Patty's day blow-up hat that everybody was laughing at and my brother thought was funny.  My mother was there visiting also and she thought the hat was funny.  I also brought him a flower centerpiece for his room that was St. Patty's day related.  He wanted to talk to his wife who was in the Philippines and I tried to help him call her, but we were unable to get her on the phone.  He also wanted me to get him some sugar-free candy as I usually picked some up in the store in the lobby of the hospital when I visited, but it is a smaller hospital and the store was closed because it was Sunday.  So, I offered to go to Walmart nearby to get him some.  I left and came back with the candy and he was very happy that I did this.  One odd thing that happened is I saw a friend who I used to work with at Walmart which was surprising as this area was quite a distance from where I thought this friend lived.  But, my friend told me she had recently moved to that area.  I was unable to go back to visit him when he took a turn for the worse within the next week and was sent to ICU.  I came down with the flu and I did not want to spread my germs in the hospital and definitely not to my brother.  The last thing I remember is the tight hug we shared and us both saying we loved each other.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JHYX09G,
