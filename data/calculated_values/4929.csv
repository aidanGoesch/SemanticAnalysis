I was working as a sales manager at a firm and now it was a time for me to retire. I have served for the firm for nearly 20 years.  I was working over my age because I like my work but 3 months ago I though of retirement and so I said them that this is the last month of my working. All of the staff and member were emotional and also were sad that I am going but were also happy that now I can rest in my life. They arranged a retirement party for me and every one out there were so proud of me. They were all cheering me up and I was very much pleased with that. It was the nicest day of my life. I was filled with tears and joy at the same time. My wife and my children were also very very much proud of me. All the staffs and employees were also very much proud of me. They gave me a Memento and I was very much pleased with it. All of them gave me a warm hug and cheered me for my upcoming life. After that event, I have to totally transfer my living style. I was now having very much free time and was not knowing what to do with it.",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JIO5095
