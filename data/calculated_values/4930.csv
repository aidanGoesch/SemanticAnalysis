He has not played baseball for atleast 5 years, and seeing him start again is so awesome! He used to be so amazing, but eventually he lost interest. I am not a baseball kind of guy, but i am a total baseball dad. I loved going to see his games, james always out performed expectations. Once he began to lose interest, it went downhill very quick. Now that he has begun again, he is back to being incredible, and outperforming my, and everybody else's expectations.  I honestly think he could make a career out of it, if that is what he wants. He can pitch better then anyone, he can bat and has the home run record at his school. He has all the attributes it would take to go professional. He would make a great role model. Even his coach said he is amazed. My son was able to get right back into the swing of things. This summer will be another amazing summer. I get to spend my free time, watching my son crush baseballs, and there is nothing i would rather spend my time doing. Warm summers, cold drinks, and watching their son excel at competition, is what i think almost every father on planet earth can enjoy",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JS0B099
