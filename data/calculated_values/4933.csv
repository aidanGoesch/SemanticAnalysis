We worked and lived in different states, so we couldn't see each other often. For the holidays, she invited me to her home to celebrate. A couple days before Christmas, she spilled the big news. She told me she was pregnant as we were sitting in her couch in her living room. I couldn't believe it. She had been trying to get pregnant for the past two years, and hadn't been able to. It had taken a great toll on both her and her husband. I didn't like seeing her unhappy. Yet here she was, telling me that I would soon be an aunt. We both started crying tears of joy. She had wanted to be a mom for so long and soon it would become a reality. We decided to go to the mall to see what we could buy for the baby. We were both so excited and I wanted to buy my little nephew or niece something. I love my sister a lot and this news was amazing-- not just for her, but for me too. I had always wanted to be an aunt.",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JSY2905
