She had been struggling to become pregnant, and it finally happened after weeks of fertility treatments. Her and her husband deserve to have a baby. Everyone at our father's day event became an emotional mess after finding out the great news. It means a lot to me that I am finally an aunt, so that is why I started crying. My entire family also cried. I have always wanted to have a baby in the family. Whether it be a little sibling or a niece or nephew, I always wanted a baby. After we cried, we all went shopping to the store Marshalls. We were off to find clothes and new accessories for the new baby. We are thrilled to have this baby in our lives. It came as quite the surprise, but it was very happy. The ultrasound made us weep when we saw it. We all can't wait to find out the gender of the baby. I am so happy for them.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JSY2905,
