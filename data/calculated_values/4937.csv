My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant for the past 2 years. We've tried to do everything we could do, expect for IVF. We couldn't afford to do IVF because our insurance won't cover it. I've spent so much money on vitamins, supplements and devices to help. It's been an exhausting and trying couple of years for us. Then 4 months ago, I felt extra moody and tired. I didn't think much of it because I can get like that sometimes since I suffer from anxiety and depression. I tried not to look too deep into it since I do that with every little twinge or flutter. Then a week later I noticed something even more strange, my gums bled while brushing my teeth. I read that this happens during pregnancy so I went and bought a test without telling my husband. I waited until the next morning when he left for work. I took the test and 2 minutes later, I saw it. There was 2 lines. It was positive! I couldn't believe it. I still don't believe it. But 4 months later I am carrying a baby girl. Sometimes I still get anxiety about my pregnancy, like it isn't real or something bad will happen but I just try to stay calm. I use techniques to relax like exercise, mindfulness and deep breathing/imagery. We are starting to let ourselves get excited. We picked a name, Maya. And soon we will start getting the nursery together. Even though I am so excited, I'm surprised how elated my husband is. He has already bought clothes, bought name books and researches everyday about the baby growth.",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JSY3906
