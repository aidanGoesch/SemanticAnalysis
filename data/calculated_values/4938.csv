He is like a son to me and I am so proud that he was able to make this happen. He just got this job and it was his dream job, so we celebrated it, my wife and children and I, because he has finally made it in life. I have heard great things about Google as an employer and my cousin will likely fit right in. He had a rough life in the beginning and struggled a bit to get where he is, but I know he will do great things at Google. He wants to stay there for a long time and become an executive of the company, and I have no doubt that he will. He has always been a very smart kid and was ambitious as he worked through his various life struggles. My wife and kids are very close to him as well. My kids like to hang out with my cousin and learn about computers and programming with him, and he is always happy to teach them. Maybe one day they will get jobs at Google as well. My cousin is the baby of the family and we always thought he would do great things. It seems like a long time ago that he got the job at Google, but it was only 6 weeks ago and his life is about to change very much. He gets paid very well and will be able to buy a condo and travel and do all of the things on his bucket list. We are so proud of him and all that he has done. We went out to dinner a few times to celebrate and invited some of his friends along with the family. My children want to grow up to be just like my cousin and I can't imagine a better role model for them.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A10DGUF9
