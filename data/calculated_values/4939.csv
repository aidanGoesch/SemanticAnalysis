I was with my wife and children having fun just as we returned from church. My wife and I are gisting and equally packing some clothes in preparation for a new week.  and the children are busy watching cartoon. And waiting for their lesson teacher to come around and help them with their assignments. I suddenly received a call from my younger cousin that he got a job at Google. it was one of the happiest days of my life as I was really really excited for him. I was so happy and excited because I personally sponsored his academics. right from when he was little and therefore I'm like a father to him. We lost our parents when we were very little. I can proudly say that day is the happiest day for me so far this year. I instantly called my wife and children and we celebrated it. I took them to the shopping mall and bought them nice things. it was indeed a happy day.,,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A10DGUF9
