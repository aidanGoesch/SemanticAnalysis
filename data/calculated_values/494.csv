It was a fun day that day. I had a great time eating all the different foods. I had a beer with a corn dog. I had some wine with a burger. They were all delicious. At the end, there was a talent show. There was a ton of talent that day. There was a magician who pulled a rabbit out of a bottle. It was insane. There was a woman who got cut into three parts, with all the parts moving. I don't know how they did it. They finished it with a man in a straight jacket doing the Houdini act. He barely got out of time before he drowned. It was scary. I hope to go to one of these again.",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCTHTEQS
