We loved every second of it. It was magical. We stayed at the French Quarter and my husband had never been before. We went to all the parks and for our honeymoon night diner we ate at the california grill. it was the first time either of us was able to eat at a fancy restaurant. we were treated like royalty because we wore our honeymoon pins in the park. my husband actually got to star in the festival of the lion king thanks to those pins. i don't think we could hae picked a better place to get married. we talk about it all the time and we have so many fond memories. we loved bein in florida. we especially loved being in disney. we will be going back every year for our honeymoon. i know it won't always be as perfect, but i hope it will be close. we loved our trip and we will definitely be back.",3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A10VOFU2,
