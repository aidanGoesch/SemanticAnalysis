We also started the vacation at a place called raglan road in downtown disney. there were dancers and music and it was irish themed. my husband is of irish ancestry so he really loved it. we were married at a little chapel right outside of disney under trees covered in spagnum moss. it was beautiful and everything was perfect. It was the most memorable event of my life and I feel so lucky to have been a part of it.,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A10VOFU2,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A10VOFU2
