This might not seem like a big deal, but it was.  She and I have been together as a duo for her whole life.  I have shaped my day to day life around her.  I know that in two short (very  short) years I will have to begin to define myself as a single person again.  And I will have to see her as launched and independent.  But it is so hard.  I have really lived my life for her for nearly `17 years.  So, dropping her off for camp was a trial for me, seeing what it would be like to wake up alone, without my daily focus on her.  In some ways, it was easy.  The house was neat and clean.  The sink was spotless (mostly!).  But I missed her and I realized how much I will need a personal goal as I (and she) moves forward.  I never thought I would live through my child - or for her.  But it is indeed what has happened and I will have a life when she leaves me.  So, the past few weeks have been full of tears and full of some guarded hope.  And lots of pride (for her).  Most surprising was the fact that she still needs me and emailed every day.  Perhaps this is a harbinger of our future relationship (needing me from a distance).",3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A13G5UF7,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A13G5UF7
