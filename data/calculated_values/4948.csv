My husband was unemployed and I wasn't the only person working. I worried about paying bills constantly. We didn't have a car so we had to borrow my inlaws car. And my family didn't fit in the car so we didn't go anywhere together. A few months ago my husband found a job and they promoted him to management. We still have to watch our finances but now I can allocate money to bills and know that we eventually will be able to pay. We also bought a new car. And our while family will fit in it. For the first couple of weeks I took my kids with me everywhere. There was no need to leave them home with a sitter. They soon got tired of being in the truck. But our truck has a screen that the kids are able to watch movies. So long trips aren't as difficult for them. Now I am able to plan. I can write out my bills and know just about what I can pay and when I need to pay it. It really takes a load off of my shoulders.,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A18S0UFV,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A18S0UFV
