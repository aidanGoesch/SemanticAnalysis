An instructor at college once told me my work was better than any graduate student's work he had seen in his career and I was an undergrad at the time. The way way Sheryl put her arms around my neck and gave me ""the look"" you always want to get from the woman you love. driving my beloved and ancient cat to the vet while it's suffering Jacobson's contractions on the seat, and dying before we got there. looking down into the toilet and seeing it filled with blood and realizing my ulcer had burst and that I needed to get to the hospital right now. Pulling a dead man from the ocean and trying to bring him back to life with no success. having a friend offer me my dream job, without a single interview, and being the happiest at work I have ever beenscreaming at work at the insanity of a stupid proposed strategy that cost millions. buying that first Mercedes convertible and driving home with the top down and feeling like a million bucks. waking up in the broiling sun, naked, on the deck of a dive boat after being rescued from certain death by the US Coast Guardrelaxing with a cigar at the end of a long and wonderful day in Positano, Italy with my girlfriend. feeling my heart pounding when the mugger pulled out the switchblade and backed me against a fence overooking a canal in Amsterdam. having my sister ask me to walk her down the aisle after my father died. my mother, giving me my father's gold watch, that his father had given him- standing back and viewing the sailboat I had built from scratch signlehandedly, the first time it was completely finished. opening up the envelope and seeing the packet containing my first patent and the big bonus check that came with it. looking into the eyes of the woman I loved the very first time I entered her and seeing love reflected back at me.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A1ALLUF4
