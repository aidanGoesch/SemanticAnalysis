I have always wanted to be the head of some type of group with people and recently I had the chance. With the release of The Galaxy Note 10 came a large opportunity to create a reddit group to encompass the new device. This is a yearly thing wherein people create a subreddit(community) dedicated to the newest Samsung device every year. I browsed reddit but found that someone had already created a galaxynote10 subreddit. I was honestly pretty gassed about the situation so I decided to take a deeper look. Upon further inspection I found that it was private/locked and with that came an idea. I decided at that very moment to create a new subreddit dedicated to the device to attract the people who would have gone to the original had it not been locked. I named it r/TheGalaxyNote10 and immediately got to work making it look official. My main goal was to make it look so official that even if the original subreddit opened up, people would still come to mine due to how ""Official"" it felt overall. After claiming the subreddit name I immediately went to work customizing the palette of the community and creating a custom banner in the style of Samsung's official font. I honestly had not felt so motivated and excited for a long time and the thrill of working against the clock was exhilarating. After setting up the theme and having it look official and beautiful I knew I had to spread the word about it so I posted to the r/Android community as well as the Samsung communities. After posting to numerous subreddits to get people to know that my subreddit was not private and available for all, I had quite a few negative comments. People were putting it down saying it's not the official subreddit and they down-voted it numerous times. I don't know if you've ever had someone just be incredibly negative towards something close to your heart that you worked hard for but it felt absolutely horrible. It hurt quite a bit so I honestly just logged off and said whatever, ""I did my best."" What do you know, the next morning I wake to have over 100 members! Holy moses it was incredible, I thought this was going to be a failure but I succeeded. After a while I was given the original r/galaxynote10 subreddit since it had been private for so long so I migrated everything over to the new one. I now own the original subreddit and have amassed nearly 6000 members in 3 weeks! It honestly was incredible to actually win one which is why I shared this. If you all like the phone you should check it out, I'd love to hear your thoughts.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A1BLEUFY
