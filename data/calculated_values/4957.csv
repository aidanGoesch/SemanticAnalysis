I've had him since he was a puppy. He was a little scrawny thing {and so was I), no more than six pounds when we first laid eyes on each other. I picked him out to play with him and told him I'd be back that weekend to get him when I got paid. He looked hurt that I was leaving, but I assured him I'd be back. Fast forward 13 years and he's been my constant companion. He's almost a person the way he behaves. When he started having seizures at the end of the summer, it made me realize that he's not going to be with me forever. I mean, I knew this day would come; your pet going on is always in the back of your mind, but it always seems far away. Then far away gets real close. He likely has a tumor and he's on medication, which seems to be keeping the seizures at bay. I know one day the medications won't matter and we'll part ways. For now, I'm going to take every day with him as a gift, as cliche as that sounds. I will do my best to usher him into the next life and I hope we'll see each other again. I take comfort, as small as it is, in that when he does pass, my grandma and my other dog will be there to take care of him.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A1KIBFUJ
