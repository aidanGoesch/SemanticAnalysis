Things went well at the start. Even though the city was a large, and expensive one, I had gotten an Airbnb for a few weeks, to stay at while I looked to sign a lease at an apartment. Rents were very expensive, which I expected, and many areas were places that I wouldn't consider living because of noise, crime, and similar factors. Still, I was able to find a  semi-reasonable, comfortable, place within a week. So finding a place to live was going well. The student teaching job, was another matter entirely. My adviser had assured me that the program I had selected, was going to start in the Fall, which was a couple of months from now, so I went about buying furniture and stuff for my new apartment. Not long after that, I happened to be looking at the courses I was scheduled to teach on the college employee portal, and I saw there were several course conflicts; I had been scheduled to teach more than one class, in the same time slot. It also turned out that these classes weren't for the Fall semester, but they were starting in the Winter. I was receiving a grant for housing assistance and living expenses, dependent on starting teaching in the Fall, and my savings were limited, so this was going to create problems very soon. I went to the campus and spoke to my adviser, and at first tried to insist that this was the course schedule I had selected. After that, he blamed a 'problem with their computer system.' Finally he told me that he had indeed made a mistake, but the Fall schedule had been set, so at this point there was nothing he could do. I found myself in a strange city, with bills I would soon be unable to pay, and no clear purpose for being there for the immediate future. I attempted to look for work for the next month, but couldn't find anything, so I ended up breaking my lease, paying a penalty, and moving home. I would have to start the process of getting a student teacher appointment, from scratch.",,3QY7M81QH88VD92TS5UGZQOM8N57KD
