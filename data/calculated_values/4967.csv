In 2018 he put our family cabin up for sale. He had been diagnosed with tonsil cancer. To me this was just a knee jerk reaction He felt he might not be around much longer. I feel he didn't want to leave us with what he might think was a burden financially. We all tried to tell him this was not a good decision. However, no one knew his personal struggle at the time. We didn't want to upset him more than he already was. We were all very surprised when he chose to do this. No matter how much we talked to him and tried to get him to change his mind he did not. We made the most of that ""last"" summer at the lake. It was difficult but what mattered most was his health. We were very pleasantly surprised when my dad told me that he was letting the contract end. He decided he was not going to renew the contract. Our cabin would remain in the family. This was the most wonderful gift ever. While 2018 was awful, 2019 has been good to us. We not only got to keep the cabin and were very thankful it did not sell, but my dad is cancer free. This cabin has been a part of my life for over 40 years now and has been a big part of my life every summer. While I was hurt he put it on the market, my surprise at him taking it off is something I will always remember. It helped me realize to live each special moment making memories because you never know when things might change. Life is precious and we sometimes need those reminders. This was a hard wake up call and I am forever grateful for it. We still have questions as to why he did it in the first place but happy he changed his mind. We are also hoping this does not happen in the future.",3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHOHNW7A,
