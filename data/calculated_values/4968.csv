It had been on the market for a year. It was a very memorable and happy occasion. This place that I have called a summer home for 44 years was placed on the market after my dad got cancer. It was a flip decision that he made. No matter how hard we tried to convince him to not place it on the market it did not work. We thought last summer was going to be our last time up there. People were in and out with realtors showing our home. It was a struggle, but more memories were made that summer as we thought it was our last. We were sure to enjoy each moment more than we ever had in the past. As each day passed and our place did not sell we felt a sigh of relief. I was such an amazing experience when my dad told me he was letting the contract expire and would not be putting it back on the market. This was such a relief and made not only me, but my kids and husband so very happy. It was quite a memorable time to see it finally come off all the realtor sights. We made sure that we were going to have another great summer up there. It also made me realize to enjoy everything we have to our best ability because you never know when things may change.",3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHOHNW7A,3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHOHNW7A
