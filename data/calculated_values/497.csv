It's near the old cathedral and serves organic wine. It had just opened and was on a charming street with old style street lamps and cobble stones and had a comfortable, cozy and dark atmosphere inside. I had wanted to try it and it was good to see her. I didn't realize that she had invited several other friends of hers, people I know a bit but not too well. I wasn't planning on drinking as much as I did, thinking that she and I could have a couple of glasses of wine each and go home. But the conversation took a life of its own, the bottles of wine were ordered and drunk. I was enjoying myself and did not realize how much wine I had to drink. Lauren ordered a charcuterie board as well, which was delicious and seemed to encourage more sips of wine (to go with the cheese, of course). We were laughing and gossiping about the other colleagues in our department. Before I knew it I was drunk and feeling unstable on my legs. We all were and only left once the bar closed. I have no idea how I got home. Cabs are expensive so I must have braved the train late at night on my own, which is not safe. The next morning I woke up and felt terrible. My mouth was like cotton wool, I was dehydrated and my skin looked blotchy. That's it, I concluded! This cannot happen again. I need to detox, step back from drinking so much and take better care of myself. No more late nights alone on the train without the use of my full faculties. It has been surprisingly easy. I thought I would crave wine but I do not miss it or the hangovers. I appreciate feeling good, hydrated, and have been running and exercising more consistently. I wish I had done it sooner and it will be easier to limit the wine going forward, I really believe.",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCVX7EQ4
