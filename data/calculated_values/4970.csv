I finished my Master's Degree in Accounting. This came after six months of hard work and determination. I worked endlessly day after day to finish ten demanding classes. I wrote papers, took numerous tests, and completed many different projects. This was all more than worth it. This degree will help me in my career. A Master of Accounting Degree will help me to make more money at a job. It will also help me to prepare for the CPA exam. Because of this degree I am now more marketable in the workforce and can be more prepared for my job. I feel very blessed that I received this degree. I had a few setbacks along the way that almost derailed my goals. I failed a few tests and papers. Thankfully, I was able to redo or resubmit the tests or papers. This way I could receive a passing grade and earn my degree!",,3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHWOZ7WJ
