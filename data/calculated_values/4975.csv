He is a very nice and attractive guy. I like him very much. After we met for a couple of time, he told me he got STD. I still wanted to be with him. So we still went out and have great time together. It came from his last relationship. It was incurable. I was very surprised. I checked online a lot of information. It is very hard for me to break up. I like him a lot. He told me he did not want to continue. I agreed. I was very sad for several months. It is a tough relationship, which could end up with a much better outcome. I still remember the time we spent.",3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7512GC6,
