It was very hard for me. I really love him. He had STD that is very serious. He did not tell me after we already dated for a while. He got his STD from an ex girlfriend. I think it is not easy to accept. We had a talk about it. I checked some books and documents to get to know the disease. We decided to end the relationship. I went to check the STD for myself and I did not get it. We still hang out a couple of times after that. It took me several months to get over it. I still miss him. I had good time with him. It is very memorable.",3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7512GC6,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7512GC6
