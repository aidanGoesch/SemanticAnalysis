As was the case most of the time, I had no idea what I was truly looking for.  I went to the buy here pay here lot around the corner from my house.  There were the typical little cars like the Versa and Corolla, but I saw the nicest blue Mazda 6 I had seen.  After a brief chat with the salesman he allowed me to take a test drive.  We got about a half mile from the car lot when the car started sputtering.  In a panic I pulled into the Kroger parking lot nearby.  The salesman and I got out and took a look under the hood.  Apparently the car had a fuel leak and we ran out of gas.  We were stuck at the Kroger for about 45 minutes before a tow truck came and took us and the car back to the car lot.  I promptly got back in my car and left, even while the salesman tried to convince me to check out another car.  I decided that I was done looking at cars for the day.  From then on I only went to branded dealerships, as they at least check out their cars before putting them up for sale.  Maybe one day if I see the right car on another small lot I may check it out.  For the time being I think I'll stick with shopping at places with much better quality control.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7EUEGCD
