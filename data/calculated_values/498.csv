I woke realizing I needed a change, a new direction in life. Going sober for 30 days seemed like an easy undertaking, at least at first. Let the journey begin! Day 1 was inspiring, I visualized my future self as a sober successful and highly functioning human. Big announcements were made to all of my friends and family about this new undertaking, the new sober me. Day 2 - 5, this is easy being sober and slightly more functional. Motivation to work out kicked in around Day 6, which lasted until about Day 9. Day 10 - 15, I yearned for this new and improved sleep I was promised so early on in my quest for sobriety and it finally came. The deepest soundest sleep I have had in years, it felt amazing to wake up so tired because you slept so hard - I got this! Day 16 - 20, still sleeping and I guess I am a better functioning human. Still hate my job and only slightly more motivation to work out. Day 21, an invite to join friends at a bar - gulp! Could the new sober day me complete this test successfully? Yes, I did it! I went to a bar and woke up the next day feeling great - no hangover to plague me. Day 22 - 26, sleep is great, sleep is good but what about the higher functioning me? Have all of the years of almost daily drinking dulled my ability to be a higher functioning successful person? I only have 4 more days to figure this out, maybe it all clicks on day 30? The final 4 days were spent recapping this journey until it arrived, the big 3-0. I woke up that morning feeling nothing new or different, I am still the same me.",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCVX7EQ4
