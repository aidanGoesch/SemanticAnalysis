Her and my dad were seperated. When I was thirteen, I started getting in trouble and my mom thought it would be good for me to live with my military dad. So I traveled all the way across the country to go and live with my dad. I had no idea how stressful it was to be in a military family. I remember one day my dad coming in and sitting the whole family down, right when the gulf war had picked up in the 90s. ""I might have to go to war, guys. I might be deployed."" He hung his headband began to cry. It was a stressful couple of months, not knowing what was going to happen, dad always talking about things I had no idea about, war terms and such. Finally, he came home one day and said he was not going to be deployed. Everyone was so happy. But that didn't take away the stresses. We may have to move, may have to change schools, he may be stationed somewhere else. It was a constant churn of not knowing. I didn't like the feeling. I was so glad when dad decided not to reenlist after 21 years of being in the military. It was such a relief knowing we would never have to move again.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7EWCGCF
