We were together for a long time. It seems so out of the blue. I am so broken over this. I feel depressed and not like myself. I don't find pleasure in things I once enjoyed, it's hard to get out of bed everyday and simple tasks. I am having thoughts about hurting or killing myself, it feels so dark and lonely. I need motivation to get out and start doing things. I recently met this guy Alex, he is very nice. I wanna say he is hitting on me, but we will see. I keep running into him and we have made plans together. It's finally something I am looking forward to. I hope I am not rushing into anything too fast. I find him very attractive and charming. I hope I am ready to see where this leads. I could really use him to get out of this way I am feeling.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7UQXCG0
