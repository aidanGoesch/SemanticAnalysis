It was gonna be my sons first ever birthday party. Although this wasnt his first birthday, this was his first actual party. He was finally at that age where he would enjoy a day of friends and family dedicated just to him. The previous day we went to Walmart and gathered enough supplies for the attending bunch. Paper plates, plastic silverware, burgers, hotdogs, soda, you name it, we got it all. The special day came and one by one relatives from all around traveled here. My parents drove 3 states to be here. And my wife's parents drove 4! My sister in law also drove nearly 2 hours to bring her daughter here, who's a special friend of my son. The party went amazing, we grilled up some burgers and hotdogs. Both of our parents brought a variety of homemade foods as well. We had a full buffet going which made my sons eyes light up as he loves food. We played games throughout the party that he could enjoy. Tag, bean bag toss, monkey in the middle, we even had a pinata.  However the best moment was when we brought out his cake. We had them decorate it with his favorite superhero and he went wild. Probably the biggest smile I've ever seen on him. We cut him out a slice and he dug his face right in! Today was such a magical day. While we lay here in bed, my wife and I can't help but feel so prideful and joyful as we had really made his first birthday party special.",,3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6Z3EMMI7
