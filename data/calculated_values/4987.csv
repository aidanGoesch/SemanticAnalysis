He was turning 1. A few weeks before the big day, I created a Facebook Event and shared it with all of our friends. We also sent out invitations to many people we know who do not have Facebook. We reserved a large gymnasium for the party. This was fairly easy because I work at a school. I talked to my secretary and was able to reserve the gym for free! My sister-in-law arrived about an hour early at the gym and decorated. We had everyone park out back because there was a closer entrance to the gym back there. My son had a lot of fun playing with his friends, opening gifts, playing with his toys, and eating his cake. The event was a huge success. My wife and I also had a great time eating, opening gifts for our son and talking to people we have not seen in a long time. Many people drove over an hour to come see our son on his special day. I felt really happy for him. It was a great day!",3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6Z3EMMI7,
