I could barely understand what she was saying, but after a bit I learned that her grandfather had passed away.  This was a man she was quite close to as she spent a lot of her summers growing up with her grandparents.  It had happened suddenly, so she didn't get a chance to say goodbye.  A couple days after this call, she came over, dark circles under her eyes.  She asked if I would go to the funeral with her as she didn't think she could go without me.  I of course agreed, although I was pretty uncomfortable.  I'd never been to one before.  The day of the funeral, I dressed in a dark suit, picked up my girlfriend, and drove over to the church for his service.  There were so many vehicles in the lot that it was difficult to find a spot to park.  When we made our way into the church, I was grateful that the pew in the front was reserved for family and I was included in this as her boyfriend.  It was packed.  It was very humbling and surreal to see so many had come out to pay their respects to this man.  I can only hope that when my time comes, I have made enough impact positively on the world to have the same turnout.  It was a very sad, but memorable time in my life.",,3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZB8BIMO
