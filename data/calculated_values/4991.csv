It was a relatively solemn occasion. What surprised me most happened when I saw my girlfriend's dad cry for the first time. He wasn't all that close with his father. The tears certainly surprised me. It was a jarring image to see. Afterwards, we all went out to eat. We had a buffet style dinner at a Polish restaurant. We talked about memories we had of him. I wasn't overly fond of him, so most of my stories I would have shared wouldn't have been positive, but alas. His wife made sure to talk to several people and offered leftovers to everyone. It seems to be a slightly impersonal ending to the day, as it seemed way too normal to me for some reason. I drove home with my girlfriend and recounted the day. She said she, too, found it strange. Honestly, it was just a very weird day.",3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZB8BIMO,3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZB8BIMO
