We have been struggling in our marriage, and this pushed it over the top. It made me question whether staying with him was worth it or not. I felt it was the right thing to do because you stick with your partner for better or worse, through sickness and health. Both of us are at fault. We started drinking and things got too far over something minuscule. After endless arguing, we ended up in a physical altercation. I was trying to get out of the house, and he wouldn't let me. I started hitting him. He wouldn't budge. I already hated when we argued, but now, I'm not allowed to leave my own house. I felt like a prisoner. Why can't he just let me leave? We would fight for a few hours before anything subsided and got to sleep. However, we only got a few hours of sleep because of the hours we stayed up arguing and fighting.",,3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZDPDMIU
