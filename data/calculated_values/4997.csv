It was on another level for me. I was extremely close with my grandmother. I knew that she was getting ill, and a big part of me knew her time was coming close. I avoided her. She asked me over, and I'd make an excuse about why I couldn't come. I always was sure to tell her how much I loved her, but I just couldn't bear to see her so sickly. Eventually, she passed away, and I had the biggest problem dealing with it. I felt such an extreme amount of guilt for not seeing her before she passed. I even started blaming myself about it. After talking with friends about it, they told me that what I did was wrong. But they didn't just try to make me feel worse. They told me that it was understandable why I did it, and that I should try and move past my mistake. They told me not to make it again with anyone else. I'll never forget that advice.",,3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJULUOX9
