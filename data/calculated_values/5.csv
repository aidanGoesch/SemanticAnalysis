I am definitely still recovering from it. It is strange, now that I go out there and actually enjoy it more, I have a much harder time out in the default world. I was gifted a tourmalized quartz by a super nice guy that was a volunteer at the box office. I met him at the airport out there. I have been having issues with money and just basically not caring at all. I have had this problem before after coming home from burning man, but this year is definitely different. I feel like since my journey to get there is (now) much easier on me that always, when I come back home to the default world, I need to account for the default world to pick up the slack. It really does suck, though, this year I had to borrow money from Quickstep so that I wouldn't be evicted! I have been having such issues, from me not working enough and also all of the regular Burning Man bills. I really wish that I had a lot more sources of income because there really is nothing I can do about it. I wasn't able to go into work last week because I didn't have the money and no one will let me borrow any money. It really sucks. Thank god for Quickstep. I still am not out of trouble yet. Now, I am not feeling well. I have a cold or something from my ear, but I found some allergy medicine that has been working. I still owe Ashley money, Jason the puppy sitter, and I am late on paying my credit cards. I wish that I would have just not paid my camp fees. and also, worked more when I came back. I also can't rent a car through Turo anymore because they want to charge me for some chipped paint.",,3018Q3ZVOJCZJFDMPSFXATCQG06AR3
