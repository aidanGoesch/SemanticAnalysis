I had attempted for 10 years to go on this trip and was never able to work it out. Success FINALLY! Trip was the Kid Rock Island Jam.  I was able to connect with lots of long time friends that i have not seen in many years. We had so much fun. I was able to connect with a new friend I had not actually met in person. And that was amazing. I was in heaven. Gambling, friends and kid rock. Nothing else better then that. I had such a great time. I was in a perfect location as far as my room. I was able to easily get between the shows, the water and various groups of friends, as well as to the casino to gamble.   This trip was way past due to happen for me and I really needed this trip. I had a blast.",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B1HCWHY,30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B1HCWHY
