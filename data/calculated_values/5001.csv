That day i knew i had a long day ahead of me. around 300 miles of roads where I've never been. I left early so i could have time since I imagined it would take me an hour to finish an evaluation. Everything went well at the first stop, people were great and the evaluation went well. I stopped to eat something and then i was on my way, but from now on it was everything new for me. An hour later i was at the next stop and i didn't like how the people treated me here, they got a bad score of course. The next 3 stops went smooth and them my favorite part of the trip started. I got to a coastal town where they had stunning beaches where coconut trees were on the sides of the road for like 2 miles. Unfortunately i got a flat tire there and had to stop for like half an hour. For a moment i was really scared because i didn't know anyone there and was alone but some people told me where to go and managed to get someone to do the job. After that when i was at the last place of evaluation i witnessed an accident. Luckily no one died, a woman broke her leg though, it got to me for a moment, but i managed to finish. Ready to go home i bought a beer first to calm myself down. After 3 hours i was home. It was a memorable trip for me, a lot of things happened, but i managed to get it done and now it's something nice to remember.",3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJVFDOXH,
