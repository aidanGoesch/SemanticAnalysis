I decided i would do it, the problem was that these business were far and places I've never been. I also needed to go in a car, so i had to drive there and come back home on the same day. I decided i would do it, even though i felt a little scared. I woke up early that day because i knew it was going to take me a long time. I remember i felt very excited the moment that the road trip started. I reached the first destination an hour and a half later, it took me a while to finish because i didn't have enough experience, but it went well. then i went to my second destination, the supervisor was suspicious of me because it was Sunday and he wasn't informed of any evaluation, i had to explain everything to him for about 20 minutes, i wasted a lot of time there but finished without any other trouble. After that it was all new to me, I've never been to the next place before, it was all new from that point on and it was very exciting, i saw beautiful beaches, amazing landmarks, nice cities, and warm people. It was like that for the next 2 stops, but after that i got a flat tire. I was nervous because it was 3 PM and i still had 2 more stops on the road ahead. I managed to get it fixed after half an hour and went to my next stop. After that i went to a nearby beach and took a 20-minute break. I stop and admired the view, it was a beautiful sight, took away the stress i had at the moment, but it was time to move. It took me an hour to reach my last destination. When i got there i was tired, and then i witnessed an accident, i stopped the work to help the injured person. After that i got stressed out, but managed to finish. Then i stopped at a convenience store and bought a beer to clear my mind. Then i was on my way home. 4 hours later i was on my bed, thinking about everything i saw, i was proud of what i did, i felt free, i can't wait for the next opportunity to do it again.",3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJVFDOXH,3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJVFDOXH
