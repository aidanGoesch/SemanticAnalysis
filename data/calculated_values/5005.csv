That vision became a reality when two months ago, my family brought me along for a cruise ride. Being a relative homebody, I had no prior experience with traveling. I didn't know what to do or what to pack. But, I eventually got it figured it out. On this cruise, I experienced so many different emotions that I couldn't imagine. I can imagine experiencing some breathtaking views, and that's exactly what I saw, but that wasn't all. The views were diverse and never boring. from jaw-dropping sunsets to a day where it seemed to rain harder sideways than all the way down. It took some time to get used to riding on the seas, but I got my sea legs under me pretty quick. Ultimately, this was a big learning experience for me. I wasn't expecting this journey to be so emotional. But I didn't like some of the things I saw. Some beaches were filled with garbage and dead sea life, and some areas were neglected even worse. What an experience that I won't ever forget.",,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZA564UAH
