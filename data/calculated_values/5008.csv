I'm very athletic and like to take part in activities such as hiking and mountain climbing.  I have a favorite mountain of mine. It is a steep mountain and it is often quite the tough climb. Today was no different. I started out early. I knew it would take me a good part of the day to get to the top. I had packed myself with supplies to make sure I was ready. I set out on my journey to climb to the top. I was full of energy at first. At about the halfway point I was getting very very tired. I decided to stop and take a break. I was really tired and it was nice to sit there and just enjoy nature for a bit. I decided to get up and finish it out. It was tough but I did it. I made it to the top of the mountain.,,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZACGSUAW
