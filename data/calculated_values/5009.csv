It was a beautiful day and I was incredibly excited. I drove about three hours to the hiking trail. I do not live in the mountains so I have to drive out of town to go hiking. I love hiking so I do this quite often even though I have to drive so far. When I got there I loaded my gear up into my backpack and made sure I had everything. I began the hike and felt pretty good about the task ahead. I had hiked this trail many times so I was not expecting much difficulty. However, I quickly found myself struggling to catch my breath. I'm not sure why, but on that particular day I was having a hard time making it to the top. The hike was ultimately a tough battle, but when I made it to the top the views were breathtaking. I learned that day that sometimes the mountain does not simply hand you a win. Sometimes victories must be earned through hard work and determination. I left the hike that day feeling incredibly accomplished. I have since been back to hike that trail at least one other time. I always remember that particularly tough day on the trail when I'm there.",3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZACGSUAW,
