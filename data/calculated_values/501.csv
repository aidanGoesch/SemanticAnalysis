Every year when the tickets for the convention go on sale we buy them and then just sort of forget about them for a while. Then a month before we get the AirBnB and a month after that we are sitting outside my friends house waiting for him to shower so we can start the long drive to dallas. After the 8 hour grueling trip with the obligatory stop at bucees we are there and looking forward to a good time. The line that we stood in felt like a mile long and we were definitely waiting for around an hour to an hour and a half to get inside but that was the only line for the weekend so not to bad. Inside though the culture is always great, just tons of love for video games and people and just everyone looking around having a good time buying things and relaxing. The air bnb was great also as we all just got to relax in a nice house in the suburbs and play games and talk. A friend of mine had bought a card game that doubled as a drinking game that day so we played that. It was a lot of fun everyone just sharing things laughing and overall just getting piss drunk. When everyone had deicded they had enough that night we called it quits and slept. The next day i woke up and wondered where everyone was and found a friend of mine awake. He figured they already went to the convention center so he and i walked to a dennys for breakfast. The meal was good and fun and from there we met everyone at the convention center. Was a great full day of hanging out explorering listening to panels then we headed back home for the night. We found out it was my friends birthday that weekend so we got him a cake and sang for him that night. The next day was our last day in dallas so we decided to just hang out again have some great food and visit spots around the city. We were dreading the long drive home but at the same time looking forward to the stop at buccees again. Getting home everyone was happy to relax and get some rest but at the same time sad the weekend ended so quickly. Either way it was a great time and we all look forward to next year/",333U7HK6IA1GJYXL1XXQY3Y57SEJDJ,
