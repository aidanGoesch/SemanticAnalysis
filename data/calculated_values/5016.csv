A mutual friend of both me and my ex girlfriend was invited and I didn't think much of it. A few days before the party this friend texted me with a question. They asked if my ex could come to the party. We had only broken up a few months before then, so it was still a little awkward. I told him that it might be awkward and right now it would be best if they didn't come. So on the day of the party everyone was having a good time, then my ex showed up. Their appearance had the effect that I didn't want. Things got awkward among my friends, even though she was trying her best to mingle with the crowd. I didn't really want to talk to her, but she came up to me and handed me a small gift. I was surprised and I took the gift awkwardly and said thank you. She started talking to me, about how she knew this was awkward, but she wanted to see me. Even though it was awkward, she was getting along with the other guests so I said she could stay if she wanted. This made the situation more casual and easier for everyone involved and the party went on. After the party she stayed longer than the other guests and we had a long conversation. We felt there might be a chance to try a relationship again, but no decision was made.",,3R5F3LQFV36XNATE9SESXRYU2CEZOL
