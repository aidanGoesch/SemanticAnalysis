I was resigned to the idea that I would be broke all the time and have to depend on my husband for any money I wanted or needed. My friend Jessica, who also stays home with her daughter, suggested I look into taking some night classes at the local community college. She said she was able to start her own business and work from home and make herself a decent income. My husband thought it was a great idea, so I took some business courses and got certified in accounting. After I finished the classes I jumped right into my business. I had some background in bookkeeping so it seemed smart to stick with what I knew. It has officially been 2 months since I started the bookkeeping business and it is going great. I have several clients who depend on me. I have been able to get quite a few referrals also. The best part is I can do all this work around the time I spend with my baby. I have been earning a great income and I feel so much better about myself. I am so glad I took my friends advice that day and looked into the courses. I think if I hadn't I would be losing my mind sitting at home doing nothing by now.  One of the best parts of all this is that I have actually been able to help my clients build their own small businesses. BUt the absolute best part is that I still get to spend everyday with my baby, showing her what a strong and capable woman can do!",,3R5F3LQFV36XNATE9SESXRYUW6EOZS
