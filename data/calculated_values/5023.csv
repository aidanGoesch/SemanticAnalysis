He shyly walked into the kitchen and put down a handmade card in front of me. I looked down and saw a paper with slightly torn edges and an adorably misshapen heart in the center. Inside the heart was a poem he wrote: ""I love you evree secit, I love you evree minut, I love you evree awr, I love you evree day"". I looked at my husband with tears in my eyes and asked if he prompted him to write and he said no he came up with it on his own. My son at this point had left the kitchen for fear of embarrassment when I read his sweet and tender Mother's Day card. That day completely changed how I view myself as a mother. To get a brief glimpse through the eyes of my son and see how much he adores me made me feel so much better about how I am doing as a Mom. I've always been very hard on myself in pretty much every aspect of my life and motherhood has been no exception. It is quite daunting to raise children and imparting the love, wisdom and compassion that they are going to carry with them into their adult life as they create their own journey. I found the seven-year-old  hiding behind the doorway and I wrapped him up in a gigantic hug. I told him how talented he was and thanked him for the beautiful poem. When I looked at him, he also had a little tear in his eye. I know I am raising someone who will be kind, thoughtful and compassionate throughout his life. I'm raising a future man who will not hide his emotions and will showcase his feelings openly and authentically.",3R6BYFZZP8YEC2G6977HDC95415FXG,
