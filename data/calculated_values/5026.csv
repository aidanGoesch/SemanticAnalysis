I didn't expect for it to be positive. I had just had my third miscarriage 3 months prior. My two children that I do have were conceived after over a year each of trying. This was the first month we had tried since having our miscarriage. I wanted to give my body time to heal. I took a test not expecting it to be positive. There was no reason for me to believe that it would actually happen on our first month of trying with our horrible history. I was so excited, but also so nervous all at once. I didn't know if I should tell anyone or wait a while. I, of course, told my husband right away, but decided that it would be best to wait to tell our children. I also decided to tell my mom and dad right away because I wanted their support and prayers. My mom will be watching my children so I can go to the early appointments without them. I called my doctor right away to get in for an early appointment and for any early testing. I'm so excited that we are expanding our family and pray that everything goes right this time. The fear is overwhelming at some times though. I'm hopeful that I will go full term and take home a healthy baby this time though.",,3R6BYFZZP8YEC2G6977HDC9553JFXZ
