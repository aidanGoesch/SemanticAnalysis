I offered to help her plan all of the intricate details for the wedding and wanted everything to go off without any problems. It took many, many hours of planning and preparation to arrange all of the details. I wanted everything to be perfect for her special day. As the day grew closer, my anxiety increased. The day of the wedding proved to be a stunning event. Everything from the dresses to the flowers were in order. The chapel was like a scene from a fairytale with just the right amount of elegance for the event. All of the hard work and effort paid off as it was the most beautiful wedding I have attended. There were small nuances that I probably only noticed because I had help to plan and arrange them. The people that attended the wedding were commenting on how beautiful everything was and I was smiling inside. Amazingly there were no problems that sometimes happen at wedding to deal with and everything was perfect from start to finish. I was proud of my efforts in helping the bride create a very special day. I stepped back and soaked in all of the details and special touches of the day. I will remember this wedding for a very, very long time.",,3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG
