I felt very involved in the event as I played a major role in the planning of the wedding. I was one of the bridesmaids and had helped my friend with her wedding shopping and organization. I remember waking up really early that morning and feeling a different kind of excitement, even more than I felt on my own wedding day. I helped my friend get ready with her hair and makeup and made sure that the guests were taken care of. I also helped her family members make reservations for the following day as most of them had traveled from other cities to attend the event. Although it was a bit exhausting, it gave me great satisfaction to help in the wedding. I barely had a chance to sit down and even enjoy a glass of wine. But what made me feel emotional was the toast that my friend made where she mentioned me more than her own family. After all it was the most beautiful wedding ceremony, an event I can never forget. The emotions that my friend felt that day brought back memories of my own wedding. The jitters, the excitement and the anticipation were all a part of the big day. I could take a strol down memory lane and reminisce the day I tied the knot. I often sit back and play the wedding ceremony in my mind to try to remember how the events unfolded. I feel that being a part of my friend's big day was a great experience because I never felt that way before. No one else had given me that opportunity to participate in a big way in their wedding planning.",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG,3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG
