I studied real hard at the college. I met some new friends. We always went partying on the weekend. I always got blasted and puke a lot of the times. It was worth it. I studied to become an engineer. It was tough. The material was very challenging. I had a hard time getting the instructions right for the problems. I studied hard and I graduated. I had a fun time at the graduation. There were many people in the crowd. I waved to all of them. I threw my cap in the air and got my diploma. I hope to get a good job in the coming months.",,336KAV9KYREJBDU4Q8ECC7MPVMRY2I
