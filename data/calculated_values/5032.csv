We had such a great time, and it was a memorable bonding experience for us.  It was like we had stepped onto the movie set of the Harry Potter movies.  We really felt like kids, walking around with our custom-made wands, waving them to cast spells.  I was surprised that we weren't the only people there with no children.  I guess kids of all ages love Harry Potter!  We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was while we were there.  Amusement park food has a reputation for being bland and greasy, but everything we ate or drank while we were there was outstanding.  We ate at the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Broomsticks, of course, but we also tried several restaurants and snack stands in other parts of the park.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  There were even healthy options available at several places, something that can be very difficult to find at theme parks.  The variety of souvenirs available was also impressive.  Most of the time, parks will have the same items scattered across numerous different shops, but each store at Universal had its own theme and unique items.  We did see some repeats, but most places had their own things.  We finally had to start taking photos of items and labeling them with the name of the store, since we wanted to see everything before we made our final decisions on purchases.  We were able to ride all of the rides and attractions we wanted to experience while we were there, and got to ride many of them more than once.  We were very surprised by the short wait times, even on popular rides.  There were a couple of times that we were able to walk directly onto the ride without having to wait at all!  Overall, this trip was an experience of a lifetime.  I truly hope that we can take another trip together soon!",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBSKIGTY,
