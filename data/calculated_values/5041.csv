We were best friends as kids, almost like twins, so you can imagine how excited I was. Not to mention that it's the longest we'd ever been apart. At the baggage claim area, I didn't see my sister and her fiance yet, but as soon as I picked up the phone to call, she was there. She had dyed her hair, and she had lost weight, but it was still the beloved sister I remembered. We enjoyed a quick hug, but it didn't last long. Her fiance announced in a grumpy tone that our ride was waiting. I had imagined more tears and embraces, but I understood not everything happens how you imagine it. On the car ride to her new in-laws' home, she spoke very little. She spoke more to her fiance than to me, which was strange. She had spent every day with him for four years, and in that time, I hadn't seen her at all. Occasionally, she would grab my hand and smile at me. However, my overall impression was that she was distant. Was she afraid to open up to me? Had she just changed that much? Over the course of the trip, my suspicions were all but confirmed. She barely spoke to me the whole trip. Due to the situation, I couldn't confront her about it. But  returned from the trip feeling as if I'd lost something very important to me.",,3R8YZBNQ9I4HOC0O5AEDVC0VJ8M7Q0
