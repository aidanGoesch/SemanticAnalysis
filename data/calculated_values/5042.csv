For a few months I had been putting a few dollars out of every pay check to a secret account in order to get him something that he's been dreaming of for decades. Since he was a boy he always wanted to get a motorcycle. He had posters of it on his wall and watched movies about it. His family wouldn't let him even think about it, but he vowed to get one as soon as he turned 18. Unfortunately, life did not turn out the way he wanted it to. He wanted the motorcycle, but his first priority was to get get an education, so he said he'd get one after college. After college, he didn't have enough money so he started to work when he met me and our priorities changed. First was the wedding, then the house. Then I got pregnant and the priorities changed again. After Ashley, our little girl turned 4, he started talking about the motorcycle again, but I was scared. A few weeks later, we got a big shock. Ashley was going to be a big sister! There went the priorities again. We bought a bigger house. A bigger car. We adopted a puppy from the shelter. Our lives got bigger, full of more and more. But not the motorcycle. That bike was still on his mind. A few months back, I went through all our accounts. Ashley is in college and Michael was in high school with his own job. Finally it was time! John cried that day when he saw the bike. The look on his face made it one of the best days of my life!",,3R8YZBNQ9I4HOC0O5AEDVC0VJAVQ7W
