This has been a dream of his for many years.  About 4 months ago, I decided to look around online in our area, to see if I could find a bike that would work for him to turn into a track bike, to make it his own.  I did not have a lot of money to spend, so I had to look carefully.  I may be a woman, but we are both riders, so I know a thing or two about them.  We've had discussions about this topic in the pat, and I already knew that I wanted to make this happen for him.  He's a very hard worker, and he deserves it very much!  I ended up finding 3 of them that I was interested in, so I began to write the owners and ask them questions about the motorcycles.  I narrowed my search down to the one that I thought would work the best for him, and then I told him I found him a bike!  He was so excited, so we went and looked at it that weekend, and purchased it.  This will be a good project for us to over the winter months, to get it ready for him to ride it on the tracks next year!  It needs some cosmetic work done mainly, and a little more mechanically.  We had to buy tires immediately so that he could ride it and see what he needed to do to it, to make him happy with it.  We will be able to go different tracks in a couple of different states next year, and that is very exciting!  I'm a little nervous for him, but I know that he will be safe, and I'm very excited to watch him ride, and have a dream of his come true!",,3R8YZBNQ9I4HOC0O5AEDVC0VJAVQ7W
