I will never forget when I first met him at the airport 3 motnhs ago. I feel complete and adored. My romatic partner has sparked new feelings in me that no other partner has. I am in love with him, my life and everything around us. I can never take this moment for granted, I am forever grateful I met him. I need to study myself while I'm wrapped up in such feelings. I am aware that it has been much too soon for me to feel this way. Any mistake can happen and things could turn out to disappoint me. I need to be careful not for me but for others around me to.. Why do i always second guess myself like this? Why can't I just enjoy the feelings as I go? I am getting older and need to make rational decitions based on my goals and mental health not feelings. Or am I just being selfish? I've had good relationships but none that made me feel this way before. should I trust the feeling?",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPG2DSZF0
