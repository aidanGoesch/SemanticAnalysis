The build up to meeting them was about 7 weeks, beginning in February. He had booked a flight from his hometown to a city near me. I drove about 3 hours to pick him up at that cities airport. It was the first time I had met him and seen him in real life so I was really looking forward to it. He made me feel good and cared for for so many years before we actually met. I remember seeing him standing outside the airport waiting for me. He looked a little sad and scared, but I knew that he loved me and I immediately felt safe with him and like I could breathe for the first time. We spent a week or so together at my farm before driving back to his place, a 10 hour drive, where I stayed for a month. I got to visit all sorts of new places and we did a lot of fun things together. I remember that being with him and at his place, was the best that I had ever slept in many months. It was like he and I belonged together, and for once I felt like I was with someone who could handle things and didn't need me to do it all. It was the best I had felt in my life in a really long time. He made me feel adored and loved. He made me feel really special and talked in ways about the two of us that no one even did before. I desired him like no other partner before. He are still together now, and I hope we always will be.
