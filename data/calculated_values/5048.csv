She's such a good kid, who I honestly really respect, love, and am so proud of.  I love her love of learning and of school.  It's so much fun to watch.  I'm amazed at how much she likes to gain knowledge.  Like, she prefers to have nonfiction books much of the time.  Learning facts and weird but true things makes her happy.  And she remembers these things.  Being her mom is an amazing experience that I enjoy so much (even if sometimes I want to go a little crazy).  Coaching soccer is going to be a lot of fun, I think.  It's a really good group of kids, and I hope that I can help them to start learning some of the most basic soccer skills.  It's going to be tough coming up with practices, drills, etc. that keep them engaged (this is an age where they really don't always pay attention - and especially at this time of day).  But, I think/hope I'm up to the challenge!  This year is going to be a lot of fun.  It's going to be busy, special, and probably crazy, but I can't wait.",3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD3OFZ3,
