So finally after two years it was time to graduate three months ago. I was so happy that after all the hard work it finally paid off. I finally finished my degree. My whole family came to the graduation. Afterwords i went to eat out with my family and got some gifts. It was most memorable the actually moment i got my degree handed to me and knew the moment was real. I was able to see all my old classmates so i was so happy. My family took lots of photos to be able to remember the event.  It was one of the happiest days of my life so far knowing how much time and effort i put into completing it.
