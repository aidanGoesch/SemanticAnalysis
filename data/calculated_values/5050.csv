I can't believe it.  He just up and retired at his job without even really telling me.  This happened two months ago already and I'm still so upset because it's put a strain on our marriage and obviously the household finances.  I don't know who else to even talk to about this, but I find that writing about it helps somewhat, just to get the anger out.  We still have so much credit card debt and even have five years left on the mortgage.  I'm still working full time and standing all day at the store is exhausting.  My knee feels like it's about to give out any day now and our health insurance has never been very good.  So far I've managed to pay off a decent chunk of one credit card when I worked overtime last month.  But now it hasn't been so busy now that the holidays have passed.  He doesn't even seem to care very much, he's just enjoying his retirement, sitting at home doing nothing and he hasn't even called a plumber to fix the leaky bathroom faucet!  I go to bed every night exhausted but unable to sleep.  My mind keeps racing and thinking, what if we lose the house when we've come so close to paying it off?  What if I need knee surgery?  What if I miss a credit card payment?  I'm worried about all these things and I need John to get on board somehow too.  I'm trying to convince him to work part time, at least to help me out.  I'm not not convinced that he will want to.",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC
