It was not a planned retirement. The management harasses employees on a daily basis and makes the job a miserable place to be. After months of going to counseling and being medicated by a psychiatrist, my husband decided he had to leave. Several other older employees left the job as well due to the constant stress was making them ill.  So now he and I are both at home, at least for now. His pension money is coming in monthly so we're able to pay our mortgage and car payment. We've seen a financial counselor which has helped a lot. Our 401K money has been mostly invested in a variety of stocks except for a small amount that we kept out for living expenses. Since we've received some money, we have more time to decide what to do. I'll probably will take a part time job somewhere but I'm less stressed than before and I don't feel rushed. My Turk earnings help me make extra payments on my credit cards and I'm making progress in paying them down. We often see the mail trucks in our neighborhoods speeding down the streets. They are driving unsafely but they are afraid of being written up by their bosses. The job wasn't always like it is now. The Postal Service has GPS now so they can track each employee all day. The postal worker is given a few minutes only to deliver a package and the majority of their workload consists of packages, not letters. Employees used to be able to stop and talk to their customers and they usually knew if anything was wrong. My husband even saved a customer's life once because she had cut herself so he wrapped her arm up while they waited for the ambulance. Now they aren't allowed to stop except to drop the mail quickly and get going again. More employees are falling, getting bit by dogs and having accidents because they are rushed.",3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC,
