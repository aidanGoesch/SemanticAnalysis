He wanted to leave but I did not want him to retire yet. He had promised that he would stay at his job until our car was paid off, but his supervisors and managers at work have bullied employees on an everyday basis and have just made people miserable. We went to counseling several times and he was also prescribed medication to help him deal with the stress, but there came a point that he couldn't take it anymore. So about 2 months ago, he resigned. This situation has also caused me a lot of stress. Neither of us are old enough to collect Social Security and my husband's retirement money will cost us a 10% penalty if he withdraws it before age 59 and 1/2. So I'm keeping my eye out for a job and we've been working on sorting out our finances to decide what we need and what we can live without. My own doctor has readjusted my anti-depressant and anti-anxiety meds which has seemed to help with my stress and energy levels. I don't talk about this much to others because it sounds burdensome and I know that other people have enough problems of their own. I feel very lucky to have a good psychiatrist. My husband sees the same doctor as myself. Sometimes I feel guilty about complaining because we're still better off than a lot of people. We have enough money to live on. The change in my meds has helped significantly and I don't feel the extreme stress that I felt when this first began. I think it's mainly difficult because it is a new stage of our lives with lots of big changes which can make a person feel off balance and uncertain.",3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC
