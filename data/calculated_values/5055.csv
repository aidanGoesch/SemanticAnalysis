My relationship with Justin was going so well and I felt like if I spent my whole life with him, I'd be perfectly happy. When he asked me out on a date to a really fancy Italian restaurant, I was so happy to get to go some place nice and dress up and spend time with Justin. Justin was going to love seeing how pretty I looked in it. I spent an hour getting ready for the date, fixing my hair and getting my makeup looking perfect. Then, it was time. Justin showed up to pick me up, and we headed to the restaurant. This was a restaurant I've always wanted to eat at, but the prices were pretty high, so it was definitely a special occasion restaurant. But I'd heard good things and really wanted to eat there. We got to the restaurant and it was looking really fancy. Justin ordered my favorite wine and we had a good laugh about what we'd both done all day. The food came out and it was really delicious. The night was magical so far, but after dinner, Justin took me to the beach. It was one of the nicest beaches in Florida, and the view was amazing. We were looking out over the water, and just then fireworks went off. They were so beautiful. I looked over at Justin, and he was down on the ground on one knee. Then a chill came over my body once I realized what was happening. He opened a small box and inside was the most gorgeous diamond ring. He then asked me to marry him. I was flooded with so much emotion and began to cry. In that moment, I had no doubts about him and knew he was the perfect man for me. So of course I said yes. He then got up and we kissed and hugged for a long time while the fireworks went off in the background and the ocean breeze whipped around us. It was the most magical night a person could ask for.",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGMZPFZ5
