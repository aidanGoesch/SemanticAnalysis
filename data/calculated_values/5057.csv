I did not know him, but she would always bad mouth him. The things she said were very negative and hurtful. She would sometimes go on and on about what a piece of crap he is. I didn't know him because he was not around. I tried to take what she said with a grain of salt. She had to have liked him at some point, right? That's why she got with him in the first place, right? About three weeks ago, out of the blue, I received a random text from somene saying they are my father. I didn't believe it at first. But he knew my birthday and everything! I called him up and we talked for about three hours catching up. He told me all about what he's been doing and why he wasn't around. Turns out, he had sent me cards at every major holiday growing up but my mom never gave them to me! WTF?!  The most amazing part of the conversation was at the end when he told me that he loved me. I said it back to him too for the first time in as long as I can remember. It felt so great to hear that from him and to say it. I didn't realize what was missing in my life growing up. I didn't have a bad upbringing from my mom, but it would have been great for him to be there too. I'm looking forward to meeting up with him soon. He'll be in town in a couple of weeks. I'm anxious but excited. I'll let you know how it goes after he gets here!",,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGT4VUBK
