I finally found the perfect house to rent with a fenced in back yard included so I was finally able to make my dream of adopting a dog my reality! I went down to the shelter and was greeted by a friendly adoption specialist named Sandy. I told Sandy I was looking for a dog that had been at the shelter awhile and had still not been adopted, because I truly wanted to give a dog like that a chance at a great life with me. Sandy immediately told me she had the perfect dog in mind. His name was Chance and he had been at the shelter for almost nine months,. He was a large pit bull mix who had been rescued from a fighting ring during a police raid.  After months of one on one therapy with a dog trainer who specialized in working with dogs who had been mistreated he was finally seen as adoptable. Unfortunately because of his past, people looked him right over because he looked so intimidating and barked aggressively upon first meeting. I was taken back to see Chance in this cage and he barked at me but stopped as I bent down to his level and held out my hand. To Sandy's shock as well as my own, he actually licked my hand! After that moment I knew he was meant for me and I took him home. I already had my home ready for a dog and he had a blast sniffing all over everything in sight. I prepared a bowl of dogfood topped with wet dog food. Chance gobbled the food down and fell asleep on the rug. I tried to get him to sleep in the bed with me but he didn't want to leave his special spot on the rug. Chance will never be the type of dog who can run around the dog park or have another dog or cat in our home, but I believe with all my heart that Chance was meant to be my dog.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWN8UB2,
