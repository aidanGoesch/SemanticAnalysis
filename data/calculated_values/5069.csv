I had lost my other dog about three months prior to finding my new dog Rusty. I knew it was time to get a new dog and I was excited of the prospect of giving a dog in need a wonderful and loving home that I could provide. When I walked in the shelter I asked to see the dogs that had been there the longest and were most in need. I was introduced to three dogs all of whom had been at the shelter longer than eight months. I locked eyes with a large brown dog sitting in the back of his cage barking. The adoption specialist told me he had been placed in four other current households only to be returned for not fitting into the family's lifestyle and barking to much as well as displaying food aggression at times. She said he would do best in a home where he was the only pet. I opened his cage and held the lead to take him on a walk and he obliged. We walked around the center slowly while he sniffed everything. He was an older dog, the shelter was unsure of his actual age, possibly nine or so. I sat on the bench after our walk and rubbed his ears and he laid his chin on my knee and I knew this dog needed me as much as i needed him. It brought tears to my eyes. I paid for him and took him to my house and he seemed to have boundless amounts of energy running and sniffing everything in sight. I fed him dry kibble topped with canned wet dog food and he lapped it up. That night he seemed nervous so I took him outside what seemed like every hour, he sniffed and barked and continued to stare up at me with those big eyes as to say ""Will you be returning me like the others did""?  Two months later and Rusty has finally begun to accept this is his new home. I feel fortunate I was chosen to be his owner.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWN8UB2,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWN8UB2
