It is a very awesome rundown of historical events. Events today that we celebrate as holidays. These events were from pagan traditions. Obviously my first thought was this has to be a joke. As i continued further in my research i did come to find alot of errors. What and how we celebrate these events is just wrong. These events are pagan in nature. They also hide and mask the true meanings of these events. I wasn't expecting to be so entrenched. Once again having to do with the holidays as being pagan. I further learned about the satanic origins of these events. These events played out differently years ago. Many children were kidnapped for sacrifice. Many parents were killed if they did not produce youths. These were dark times. Some not have any children out of fear. These events happened every year. A salute to pagan gods. These events were a blight on our human race. It makes me very angry. This hits close to home. I'm so glad i found this book and learned the truth. I will no longer let these events be present in my life. I am changed from all of this and for the better.,,3RGU30DZTBUJNS3YEQWTHTLZ01GJML
