I can remember feeling a bit apprehensive at first for a few reasons. One, the bachelor wanted to stay longer than I was comfortable with. This wouldn't be a problem normally, but he had planned it for weekdays which wasn't ideal. After some back and forth, we all agreed that some would go certain days while others would leave earlier. Seemed like a good compromise. After all, it was his day and I didn't want to take away from his special day. Another consideration was the mindset of the group going. We all pretty much knew one another for the most part, but I as well as another friend of mine knew these guys were spenders. We were all very upfront and open about costs. Luckily everyone understood and were cool about keeping costs reasonable. I would say the most surprising thing was the city itself. They say New York City is the city that never sleeps, but Nashville really embodied this line of thought. It seemed like there was a constant flow of people wherever we went. At the same time, everyone was so friendly and calm. You'd think crowds would be a problem, but it wasn't the case here. We all seemed to make new friends and conversation wherever we went at any hour of the day. Suffice to say, this made for an extremely memorable and eventful trip that most of us will never forget! Any apprehension I initially had faded and I would go back in a heartbeat.",3RGU30DZTBUJNS3YEQWTHTLZGGMJM1,
