Daily i went out morning with my pet dog for walking. I enjoyed with her lot and i loved very much. Since 5 years my pet dog travel with me and my family. Even though our family went or planned any trip or picnic my pet also enjoyed with our family.  My dog is one of my family member. But later on wards my dog diagnosed with an some illness. my family members so upset because that is un-curable. I thought suddenly take them to high treatment to remove the some critical situation. Finally the doctor says  just love and enjoyed with her. She automatically recover she is so tired and some more infections are affected. I give some prescription to buy and give your pet. I got all the medicines what the doctor told and give to her. Now she is in a great place. Finally she became cure with her spirit still living on.,,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHFW305M
