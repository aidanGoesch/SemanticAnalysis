It's hard to put into words how happy I am about getting together with her today. When she picked me up, I thought we were just going to hang out again. This time was different, though. We had quiet moments that went beyond friendship. As we sat by the waterfall at our favorite park, we had deeper conversation. Then, I'll never forget how she looked as we gazed at each other. So beautiful and so loving. We even held each other and relaxed for a while. We kissed and it was amazing. I love her even more now than before. I guess my feelings might be reciprocated after all. Strange that this is happening all of a sudden. Of course, I hope this is the start of much more. This is all I want.",,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHFW505O
