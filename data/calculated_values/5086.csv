He lives in Colorado, which is about a seven hour drive away from the rest of his family, who all live in South Dakota. He works full time, and before the accident, his wife was a stay at home mom to their three year old twin daughters. The tragic accident happened the summer before my daughter's senior year of high school. Honestly, it was added stress on me because I was currently very worried about the direction my daughter's life was heading. She only needed two more credits to graduate, but she was already talking about how much she didn't want to go back to school and wanted to just drop out and get her GED. However, when my daughter heard about the death of her aunt, she immediately decided that she would move to Colorado for her senior year and help her uncle adjust to his new way of life. She had always had a very strong bond with her cousins, and I knew it broke her heart that they lived far away. She helped my brother find a day care that was near a high school so that she could drop off her cousins on her way to school and pick them up after her two classes. Two months ago, I went to Colorado to watch her graduate. She walked across the stage hand in hand with her cousins. I was so unbelievable proud of my daughter for taking the initiative to help the people she loves while also doing what was best for her and her future. What made it even better was that I could tell that my daughter was just as proud of herself. I could tell that the struggle of facing an adult like life had made her more mature. But the most important thing to me was that my daughter was truly happy and proud of what she had accomplished.",,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHW6505P
