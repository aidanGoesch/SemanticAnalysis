I went to the restaurant for a nice meal. I started the meal with a nice glass of water. It was very refreshing. I then got a bowl of queso to eat. It was the right temperature. It was very good to eat. It came with chips and salsa. They were both delicious. I then ordered fajitas for the main meal. They were steak fajitas. Right when the fajitas were about to be brought out, the waiter almost tripped. I had a sweat and a bit of a panic for a second. I'm glad he didn't trip. That would of been a disaster in the making. I made sure to give him a big tip for our near trip to the hospital.",,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHX3050K
