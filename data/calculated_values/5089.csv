It was a nice place with a great atmosphere. The hostess treated me well and gave me a seat to sit in to eat my meal in a little bit. I started off with some queso. It was pretty good. It came with chips and salsa. The salsa was nice to eat. I had a beer with my meal. The beer was very smooth and delicious on my taste buds. I ordered fajitas for the main course. Something bad almost happened. The waiter brought the fajitas out but almost tripped. It was a near disaster but luckily the fajitas were not dropped. The fajitas were delicious. I gave the waiter a big tip.",3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHX3050K,
