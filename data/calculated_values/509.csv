We got the keys to our new home together and were alive with glee. We prepared for our new lives together. We'd been dating for a long while. We decided to go a step further and finally move in together. This was my first time living with someone.  The emotions were flowing between scared, nervous and excited. These last two weeks have been amazingly liberating and at times, sad. The freedom of being on our own was great. The freedom to be together wherever and whenver we want was the best part. To have every meal together and share our bed.  I can feel our love growing every day. I really have grown close to my girlfriend. I love her wild hair in the morning. I think i'll next ask her to marry me.",,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U7G2M54
