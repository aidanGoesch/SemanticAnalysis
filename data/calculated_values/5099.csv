We arrived at the campground, and there were already many families who had set up their trailers or tents. We found a spot that had some shade and parked our van. We set up our tent and said hello to some people who were there already. Our kids were anxious to go play with cousins and to play on the giant slide that someone had set up on the hill. It was a tarp with sprinklers running over it, and people had tubes that the kids could ride down the hill. Our kids ran over and slid down the hill over and over, having the time of their lives. Over the next couple of days, there was much of this and eating food together with family and having fun. On the second day, everyone got together to take a giant family picture. Each family wore a different color shirt that corresponded with the person whose family they belonged to--the seven original siblings who had started the reunion. None of the original siblings were still alive, but many of their posterity were gathered and carrying on their legacy. It was very cool and inspiring to see the ripple effect that a few people can have, and how a family can grow over time. We had fun trying to get the picture taken, but we were kind of glad when it was over as the sun was shining on us and the kids were getting restless. We also had a raffle where people had donated items, including a homemade quilt, and the raffle tickets proceeds went toward funding future reunions. It was a lot of fun and our kids and us made some good memories.  Camping can be a lot of work, but it sure is a fun part of childhood.",3RKNTXVS3NKSI9BOEGJK201GEQRA4N,
