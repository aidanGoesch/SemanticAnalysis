It is a reunion that takes place every year for his grandmother's siblings and their posterity. We drove up in our van with our four children. It is always a bit of an ordeal traveling with children, trying to keep them happy and fed and what not. There were some squabbles and other things, but we made the long drive with one stop over to visit my brother in Utah. When we arrived on the farm in Idaho, the kids scattered and we set up the tent. We were under a tree, hoping for a little shade in the the unusually warm weather. As the day wore on, our tent was surrounded by other tents as my husband's cousins arrived and set up their tents as well. We met and re-met many extended family members as our kids played and slid down the hill on a big black tarp wet with sprinklers. At dinner time, everyone gathered under a pavilion and talked and laughed. The next day, we all wore color-coordinated shirts and took a huge family picture. There was a different color for each of my husband's grandmother's siblings, and their posterity all wore that color--there were over 100 people. It was humbling and amazing to see the result of many years of labors of love from those parents and their children, their children, and their children. All of the original parents had passed on, but I could feel their presence and their joy at the gathering of their beloved children. It is now so rare that families take the time to get together, let alone 4 generations of family coming from different parts of the country. It was a beautiful sight.",3RKNTXVS3NKSI9BOEGJK201GEQRA4N,3RKNTXVS3NKSI9BOEGJK201GEQRA4N
