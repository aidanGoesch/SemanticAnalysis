And while there are a few things that unite them all fried food, rides, and carnival games, to name a few. some fairs use their time in the spotlight creatively, with kooky contests, strange delicacies, and unusual traditions. so we started planning on how to make this fair fun and memorable. we contributed money and we set up an organising committee to organise the fair, on the day of the fair, i went with my partner and my friends.  Everything from the food, to the weather, to the crazy fair art was amazing. it was really a perfect fair. nwe had lots of great tasty food, we sang and dance to the dj playing good music, we took pictures together. we were all happy and never regretted it. from the planning to the execution of the fair was impromptu and everything gave a positive result.  we all went home happy and excited after the fair. it was really a a picture-perfect day.",,3RKNTXVS3NKSI9BOEGJK201GFTS4AP
