She has been a smoker for a very long time. She has smoked for as long as I can remember. She has even told me that she would smoke a little bit while she was pregnant with me. When she told me that she wanted to quit smoking, I was really surprised. She is almost 60 and I thought she would never quit. She and her boyfriend decided to quit together. I am so happy for both of them. I have been trying to get my mom to stop smoking for years. Her and her boyfriend quit about 4 and a half months ago. I really hope that they cam keep going. I quit smoking a few years ago an I want to be here for her for support. She has her whole family that is here to help if she needs it. Smoking is a horrible habit. I'm glad that I no longer smoke.",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMVL64BV,3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMVL64BV
