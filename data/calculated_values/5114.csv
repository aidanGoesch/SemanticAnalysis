I was at college that week and it was the final week of classes before finals. I knew that my dog Shelly was sick and that she was in the hospital but I thought I would make it in time. I was so focused on finals and preparing for all the tests that I put Shelly out of my mind to focus on my grades. Mom always was talking about Shelly and how old she was getting but we all were dreading this day. Shelly was my best friend throughout my life. She got me through the school transfer in 6th grade and was my rock. I couldn't believe it when I got the call that she was in the hospital because she stopped eating. I prayed that she would hold on long enough so that I could drive back after finals and see her one last time and tell her how much she meant to me. Shelly was the nicest Boxer a family could ever ask for and I needed to see her off before she passed on. Once finals were over I packed my dorm into my car for winter break and rushed home to the pet hospital. On the way there Mom called, and gave me the news. I had to pull over on the side of the road I was crying so hard. Shelly was the only dog I've ever had but she was the best. She was such a good girl and I wish I could have been there in her final moments. My mom said she passed peacefully but I wish I could've been there to hold her as she passed on. Thank you Shelly.",,3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXCL4BU
