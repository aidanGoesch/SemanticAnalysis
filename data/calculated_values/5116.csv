I was not there. I had been out of town visiting family. When I was told that she was doing well and things were looking dire, I made last-minute plans to rush home. In the middle of the night, my only real option as a non-driver was Greyhound. As luck would have it, there was a proper route from where I was to where I was going. I booked it, and rushed to pack and leave to get to the station (20 minutes away, 90 minutes before departure). When I got there, I was denied the ability to board. My identification had recently expired. I told them my story; begged, pleaded. Nothing. I felt profoundly hopeless, hysterical, self-loathing, and broken. With no other options, I returned to where I was staying. As it turned out, I would not have made it. My dog went sometime in her sleep in the night before I would have arrived. I hadn't seen her in her last two months, and I couldn't see her before she went. It absolutely haunts me. My parents had her cremated. I still haven't been able to go back home. It will never feel like home again. Not without her.",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXCL4BU,3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXCL4BU
