I am so disappointed. This was the last thing I needed to do before getting my teaching certificate. So close, and then I hit an obstacle I can't get past. Fortunately, I have online work to fall back on. I have been making a decent amount of money with audio transcription and my blog. I also got my old job at the library back. I do that while my child is at school, and I work online while my child is at home. It's not a bad routine. I like working at the library. It is nice and peaceful there, and sometimes I have enough down time to do a little studying. And, of course, my child won't be on half days forever. I think it will be a year or two. I took a leave of absence from the university, so I'll be able to go back when my child is back on full days. I'm looking forward to it. I just hope I remember what to do when I go back!",,3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VE431EYO
