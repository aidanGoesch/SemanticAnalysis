I have been in the classroom for the past few weeks and was enjoying it so much.   My son was starting to have issues at school, so the school recommended that he be put on half a day.   With him on half a day, I was only able to student teach for half a day.  My college was okay with this, but I realized that I wasn't.  I was only going to be there until 10:40 and that wasn't long enough for me to learn what I wanted to learn.  It was such a hard decision.  Not only did I have to give up the student teaching, but I also had to drop out of my college. I never imagined that I would be a college drop out. Even for a semester. I was so excited to get into graduate school!  To top it all off - since I had to drop out of college they are making me pay 10% of my bill.   This is a couple of hundred dollars, which I don't have!  I will have to pay this back before I am able to apply to go back in January.  This is also still up in the air because we aren't even sure if my son will be able to go back to full time in January.   This whole situation has really been weighing heavy on my heart.  I have stayed home for so long with my children, and I was so excited to finally get out there and find myself.  I wanted to find my future career and finally start it.   The only thing that makes this easier is that my son is doing so much better in school.  It is hard to give up something you were excited about.  Seeing the reason why you gave something up flourishing does make it much easier.  I am planning on doing other things while I wait to get back to school. I am applying to teach online to kids in China.  I am hoping this will keep me prepared for my student teaching.  To me, something is better than nothing.  I just have to keep reminding myself that i got this",,3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VE431EYO
