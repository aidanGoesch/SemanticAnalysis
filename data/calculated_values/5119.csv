He asked me to be his best man for the wedding. When he asked me I was so excited, but as the wedding got closer, I got a little bit nervous. I had never been the best man for anyone before, and I didn't want to mess it up. I rehearsed my speech for weeks leading up to the wedding. I edited it so many times and had all my friends listen to it and let me know what they thought. Nobody had any corrections for me, so I didn't change anything. Instead, I focused on memorizing it. I had a feeling that when I got up on stage at the wedding to say the speech I would forget everything. On the actual wedding day, I brought a copy of my speech in my pocket, just in case. When it came time for me to read my speech, I decided to try it without using the paper. At least until I needed it. It turns out, I had the whole thing memorized and didn't need to reference my notes at all! I was so thrilled to be able to honor my best friend in this way. It was a beautiful wedding and I was happy to be a part of it.",,3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VE46SYE5
