It was from the hospital stating that they would start taking 25% out of his check each week to pay back his bills. This is really hard when you live basically paycheck to paycheck. My husband gets paid twice a month so that is almost $500 we are losing each month until it is paid off.  This is basically a whole month's rent minus like $25. We are struggling, but we are making it. I turk every day to help which I already did, but now it is more of I have to then I want to. We have tried not to change the way we live as we don't want to worry the kids something is wrong, but we have cut back on eating out. We might struggle every month, but we find a way to survive. Some bills are a little late, but they are getting paid. I rather have things paid then getting cut off. We only have another couple of months to get through and it will be paid off. I believe we worked it out and we will be struggling until taxes in 2020. It has already been three to four months and we are making it work. That is all you can do. You find ways to work around the struggles. No matter what they are.",3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VEKX0EYR,
