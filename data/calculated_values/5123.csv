He tells me that his boss gave him a letter. They will now be taking 25% out of every pay check he earns until a the hospital debt is paid off. This makes things hard on us. We are now stressing about bills and other stuff. 25% out of 2 checks a month is a big lose of income when you only have one person in the house working. The other person just works on mturk. I manage to make a good bit each month, but it is still very hard to make it. You just push and push and do what you kind. You have to sometimes tell you kids no on something you could have gotten them before. Or you have to decide not to eat out when you would usually do it at least once a week. You find ways to make it work until everything is paid off. You do what you need to do to make it day after day. You take the stress and you roll it in a ball and throw it away. We struggle and struggle, but we know that we will make it. We love each other and we will make it though anything that is thrown at us. That is what you do as a family.",3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VEKX0EYR,3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VEKX0EYR
