She had ovarian cancer for long time and didn't know it. She loved to take care of the children in the neighborhood. Some of the children were in poor families.  They would come by every evening. And eat supper that she would fix. They loved her spaghetti. And would usually get school supplies if they needed it. It was few months back she went to the hospital to get a check up and had tests run.  The results came back and she learned that it was inoperable and she had short time to live. In the short time she had left. She decided to make a charity for the children of the neighborhood.  Even in death she took care of the children. her home was turned into a home for children in need.  The home and charity feed and shelters children just like she would, she was a amazing person.",,3RSDURM96B8B6T6KJS9DE8VEU6JYEM
