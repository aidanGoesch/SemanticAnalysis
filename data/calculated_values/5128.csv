So, I go visit my mother to see how she and my little sister is doing. I don't get to see her much these days because I am always working. My nephew who is 21 years old lives with my mom at the moment, and my aunt had came down to visit for a few weeks. So I figured this would be a good opportunity to see everyone. When I get to my mom's house I notice that my mother isn't home, my little sister tells me she went to the grocery store to get something to drink and bread. I decide to wait and then I start talking to my little sister about school and how she is doing. Before I can finish asking her another question, I hear a loud bang followed by some curse words. I run to the living to see what is going on and see my aunt charging at my nephew and my nephew pushing her back with his hand. I ask, what is going on!? She replies, I caught Nunu (my nephew), going in my purse while I was coming out of the bathroom. I look at Nunu and he explains to me that he didn't go in her purse, he was looking for his charger and her purse was on top of it. He insists on checking him and for her to check the purse for anything missing. She declines to because she says she is sure that he went through her purse. I told them both that they need to calm down in my mothers house and talk their issues out. My aunt wasn't trying to hear any of that. She is a little crazy and has to take medication to remain calm.  As time went by, I can tell that my aunt is starting to feel stupid about accusing my nephew.  And during all of this they are exchanging foul words to each other, and I guess my aunt had enough. She swung at him two times hitting him in the face. I break her off of him and tell her that she needs to leave because she is causing trouble at my mom's house. She then calls the cops, playing the victim, and the cops take her to the bus station to go back to Pennsylvania.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6H1OMSPM
