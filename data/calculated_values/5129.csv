We had talked about the move several times, and on this particular day he was down the wire. His church had given at unbelievably sacrificial levels, but he was still at least 6 figures short of his goal. Yet they had a building deal in front of them that they could move on now before costs escalated beyond what they could afford. He asked me what I thought. I asked more questions. The answers really didn’t help me get much clarity at all, despite my friend’s best intentions. I asked him what other wise people he and I both knew were saying. He said everyone thought it was pushing the known limits. I said I tended to agree. We talked some more. So what advice did I end up giving him? I told him:I think this will be spectacular. It will either be spectacularly wonderful or a spectacular failure. And I don’t know which.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HH42SPE
