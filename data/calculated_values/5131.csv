I was graduating receiving my degree from college and i knew i was going to have a job within a couple of months. Nothing was going to make think that is wasn't going to happen, i had my degree GPA above 3.0 and an eagerness to learn. Starting out i knew i didn't have a lot of job experience i only had one internship within the government holding my resume down. I decided to go to an employment agency to help me get some more job experience so i will be able to get that dream job i want. During the sit at the employment agency i was told ""will always have a job lined up, a lot of it will be administrative work, and help find a position that has room too grown within."" I left feeling good, i was going to have a job in no time. A week passed and i got my first temp job, but it wasn't what i was expecting. It was stuffing envelopes for almost two months. At the time i was just happy to get out the house and in a corporate setting. That lasted January - February, I'm like okay i wonder what they will have next for me. 2 months past i get an email saying we have a position for you im excited, im going to be ale to make money. I go an interview for the position, i was told its strictly data entry, i get there and im told its a senior level position (contract). I was baffled at this point, i started to tell myself ""this is not what i was expecting to happen after graduating college. Now i was starting to doubt, why did i go to college and put myself in debt with student loans to be depending on other people to help find me a position. After this i decided to just start applying for jobs all day and with i was able to go on about 1 interview per month. From now to my first temp position, the employment agency haven't put anywhere and i probably got about 2 messages from them in that time period. Fast-forward to now im still trying to find a full time job but its not as bad because at first i wasn't making any money but now i got mturk and another site that helps have money in my pocket and also its like i have a full-time position. Going through all that, i was upset at first because it wasn't what i imagined to have to go through but i wouldn't change my story. I wouldn't change it because it has made me understand the value of a dollar, more confidence on interviews, and been able to network with other people. In the future when im in my project manager role this will be a story i can tell others, future husband, and future children.",3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HH42SPE,
