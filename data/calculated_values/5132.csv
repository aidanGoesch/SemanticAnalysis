I was filled with joy and happiness to walk across the stage and get my diploma. In the back of my head, I have not found the job yet that i want for so. I wanted to graduate and immediately enter the job force. Any person i told after graduating ""i don't have a job yet,"" would tell me ""it takes time it will come."" I decided to sign up with an employment agency to find temp positions for me until i can find a permanent position. Two months later i have not been placed at a temp position but i have been on interviews through the applications i put in. The interviews have really helped me get comfortable in interviews, which at first i wasn't comfortable nor confident. Where in July about to enter August and i still have not found that permanent position yet, but for some reason each time i get an interview i get a confidence boost and a desire to apply for more positions. I know it is a short amount of time that I have been out of college, looking for a job but to me it feel like years have went by. I continue to read articles online about people talking about  how long they waited for their first position after college. Throughout all my reading the average recent graduate had to wait 6 months or more to find that position. Not having anything lined up also helped me get familiar with mturk this year and is a great thing to do to make at least 100 a week. Mturk has made the time go by faster and better because im actually getting paid to do something. Instead of sitting at the house watching TV. All in all this is what i wanted but is probably what i needed.",3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HH42SPE,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HH42SPE
