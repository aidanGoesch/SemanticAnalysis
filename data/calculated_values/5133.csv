It all happened so fast, about a week ago when I saw my ex boyfriend with another lady in a fancy restaurant. I was walking my dog about 4 miles from where I live. Obviously angered by how abusive he was to me, I ran straight at him with tears trying to escape my eyes screaming his name. As soon as I got to him, all he had to say was ""what the fuck are you doing here, I thought I told you not to ever stalk me"".  This guy has always maltreated me but the love I have for him has made me blind so I end up being the to beg him. I endured this abusive relationship for far too long was the next thought that crossed my mind after he said all those shit to me. I tried to hit him on the face but I missed, he grabbed me tightly and almost thought about strangling me with his hands before my 3 year old Rottweiler jump on the table and bit his fingers and other parts of his body. It was a nightmare in the restaurant , a gory scene. And soon after I started to regret every of my actions. I thought to myself, if you had just walked away it wouldn't have gotten to this. The restaurant owner called the medics and was reluctant on calling the cops on me. Soon as the medics arrived, I got into the van with them and I was also saparated from my dog. I guess they too him to animal control. In the hospital, the doctors carried out x-rays and ran some tests on my ex boyfriend. He had a lot of open wounds so he had to get stitches and one of his fingers was also broken, so they got that fixed up also. I really wished I could go back in time and avoid causing problems.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HIZ3SP6
