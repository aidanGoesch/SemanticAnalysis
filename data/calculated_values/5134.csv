I refused. There was always a punishment involved with him if I didn't do what he wanted. So, he kept insulting me. I finally had had enough. He was laying on the couch. I stood over him, and he said one last thing. I don't remember what it was. I moved to punch him in the face, and the dog attacked him. The dog has always been very protective of me. The dog just sensed my aggression and attacked the reason for it. I didn't try to stop it. I was so angry. Although I do have guilt about not stopping it, this was the catalyst that finally made my ex move out. He was abusive to me. I had been asking him to leave but he refused. When the dog bit him, he went to the hospital, got numerous stitches and his mom took him to Florida.",3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HIZ3SP6,
