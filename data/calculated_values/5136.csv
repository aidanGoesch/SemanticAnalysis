I just continued to believe him despite obvious reasons not to. But two months ago I was at my wit's end. I knew something was up. He said he was headed out to hang with friends one night, and something seemed fishy about the way he was acting. I looked on Facebook and saw that some of his friend's were online, so I asked one of them what my boyfriend could bring that evening. That's when I knew. So began to leave I snuck out to my car and followed him. He drove for just five miles, to a subdivision nowhere close to where his friends live. I was furious but continued to stay focused. Once he pulled into a random driveway a young girl wearing a leather jacket came out and got in his car. They passionately kissed and accelerated off into the night. I didn't bother to follow them. I simply went back home and tossed all of his things in the yard and proceeded to turn the sprinklers on. Whoops! Such a shame for him that he ended up getting back nearly five hours later, to all his possessions soaked on our front lawn. I haven't seen him since.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HQ5KSP7
