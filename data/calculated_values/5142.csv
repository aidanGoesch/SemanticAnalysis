She was singing during the reception and I couldn't stop staring at her. Thinking back at it, I felt like every once in a while our eyes would lock while she was singing. But, I have a tendency to excuse away moments like that as I don't think much of myself when it comes to beautiful women. I caught her eye a few more times that night during the reception, but I didn't think much of it because obviously if I'm staring at her, she's going to stare back at me now and then to see what I'm looking at. At some point I got up and went outside to get some air and to my surprise she followed me. We started talking and getting to know one another. We didn't really have much in common but we did seem to share the same type of humor. I made her laugh more than a few times and eventually I told her how beautiful I thought she was. She was flattered by this. Later that evening I offered to give her a ride home, but she informed me that she was staying at the hotel that we were having the reception at. I thought that was going to be the end of things when she suddenly asked me if I wanted to see her room. I was in shock but immediately said yes. We went up to her room and the whole mood changed. She laid down on her bed and I followed. One thing led to another and we spent an amazing night together. The next morning I gave her a ride to the airport.",3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2K0TLLV,
