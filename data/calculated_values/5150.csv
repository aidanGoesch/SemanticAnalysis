We've spent a lot of time going through her possessions. She had a lot of amazing pictures. And, she was the last living link to the branch of my family from Belgium. We realized that she had a lot of pictures we had never seen before. I spent a lot of time looking at those pictures from family I never had the chance to meet. It really made me feel connected to my family history. She had also set aside items for each of her grandkids. We never knew she was doing this. She had collections of coins to give each of us. Some of them were really old. A couple were over 100 years old! I wonder what they are worth. But, I would never sell them. I also got a lot of her jewelry, including most of her earrings. I think  of her every time that I wear them.",3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3NA80NK,
