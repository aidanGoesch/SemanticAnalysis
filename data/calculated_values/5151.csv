She was 94 years old. She passed away on Memorial Day weekend. She had said she was ready to go, but it was still, of course, a sad moment in my life. She had gotten really frail overall and was in a nursing home the last few weeks of her life. The last time I saw her, she was asleep, and didn't wake up while I was there, but I was able to tell her that I loved her and that I hoped she had sweet dreams. It felt good to be able to do that. When we got the call, I wasn't surprised. But I still miss her, of course. She was a really interesting person. She was born to Belgian immigrants. She grew up on a farm with no electricity or running water. She had a really happy life though, and did more than she ever expected. Her funeral was really nice. A lot of people came. It was really nice to hear how many lives she touched.",3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3NA80NK,3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3NA80NK
