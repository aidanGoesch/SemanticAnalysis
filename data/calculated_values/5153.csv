I had raced many years ago and had gotten out of it. While it was always something that I wanted to do, my family always came first and working to provide for my wife and kids was my priority. There was a national event coming up and while I planned on attending it, it was only as a spectator. My family apparently had different plans as they worked out a plan with some friends of mine. Their plan was for me to actually drive a car at the track and race. They worked out their plan to perfection as I had no idea what they had planned. As it turned out, I was really surprised that they  had figured out a way for it to happen. I didn't have a car to run but they had figured out a way for me to have one to enter. I ran the qualifying passes and it felt great to be back on the race track. Yes, I was a bit rusty behind the wheel of a drag car, but it sure felt great.  My family said that I was grinning from ear to ear when I climbed out of the race car after my first pass. When the 1st round came up, my nerves were a little wound up as I had a ton of different emotions going through my system. I was nervous and excited at the same time. While in the staging lanes, my family was all around the car and we were just saying how fun it was to be at the track and that there was no pressure. It was time for the race rounds to begin so I got into the car, buckled in, and put my helmet on. I waited for my chance to run and got the car pre-staged. The lights came down and I had a really sharp reaction time. The other racer had a great reaction as well. When we got to the finish line, he was slightly ahead and I lost the race. Even though I didn't win any races, it was great to have the chance again to see if I could still do it, and I could. It was a moment in my life that I will never forget and hopefully, I will get the chance to do it again in the future.",3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3U5J0NS,
