I remember her being so excited about it, but she was very shy. She did amazing and a week after the test we got a phone call saying she was accepted. She was so happy and so excited. I worked really hard for a couple weeks to save up for her school clothes and new shoes, we got her a haircut and did everything she wanted. She got a new backpack and all of her school supplies. Two weeks ago they had a function at school to meet the teacher so we went and we got to play for a little bit. The kids in her class are just so adorable. She has a friend  and when we met him for the first time he was just so respectful and so silly. Just a typical four year old child. i remember going up to him and playing with him. He was playing in the play kitchen area with a couple other students and I walked up to him and asked what he was making. He was no nice, he made me a 'pizza'. It was fake of course. I spoke to the teacher is very nice also. I think Savannah will do very well. Yesterday she got a sad face because she didnt want to stand up for her morning meeting so I talked to her about it and hopefully she will make better and smarter choices next time she is in class.",,3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3UUIN0S
