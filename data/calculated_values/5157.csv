My boyfriend was extremely hurt and had a difficult time coping because they were as close as brothers. He passed away a few days after his birthday due to health related problems. The entire family has been devastated as it was huge unexpected loss. I did not know him for long but I was also hurt. He was someone who was extremely respectful and welcoming and liked to make people laugh.  One of the hardest things to do was see his immediate family after the loss.  The heartbreak and overwhelming emotions they experienced was very sad. It was hard to see the children. It was difficult to see his mother, brother, and wife dealing with the terrible loss. It was hard to keep my boyfriend positive amongst everything.  At one point he wanted to give up.  I told him he had to make his cousin proud who was now watching over him. I have not dealt with a loss like this so I was in shock and did not know how to react.  I just kept waiting to be told it was a joke and he was alive.",3RXCAC0YISBUB1BTCJ17FYSOCQV8GZ,
