It takes forever to get into this place. When you finally get a appointment you realize that everybody has the same appointment time as you so its a waiting game. Dad is cranky as usual he hate this place but its the only place he can go that treats him for almost free. Even though his appointed was for 10am we didnt hear the lady call his name untill 11:30. At this point both of us are pissed off i hold mine in Dad lets his show. I guess he has earned that right. The doctor goes through the normal questions as i start to drift off thinking about all the other things that i have  to do today. Hearing the doctor say how high my dads blood pressure is today snapped me back to reality.  I was almost confused dad eats like he is still in the army no junk food doesnt drink he is actually pretty good about taking care of himself. The doctor gave him some meds to bring it down and a follow up appointment to check on it in a week. Great now we have to come back. The medicine worked even before we left the clinic  so that was a relief. Of course dad wanted to stop at the barber to get a haircut  I try not to roll my eyes. He barely has any hair left I know this is a social call for him and his buddies. But I guess I dont mind he has earned it.,,3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5G01R1GA
