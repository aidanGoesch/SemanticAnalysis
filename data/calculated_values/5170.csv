She was pretty upset over it, as it was her first loss of someone close. Her family was taking it pretty hard, as they were pretty close to the grandpa. She was already dealing with a breakup at the same time. She struggles with depression and anxiety, so she was experiencing a lot of difficult emotions. She usually doesn't open up about her feelings that much, because she has difficult sharing them and being emotionally vulnerable. At a really emotionally vulnerable part of her life, I suppose it was harder to keep up the walls. She opened up about herself and how she'd been really feeling. It was so memorable because it meant a lot that she trusted me, and she admitted she really appreciated me as a friend. It's unlike her, but I knew she really meant it. We then had a deep talk about life in general, which was pretty moving in itself. I don't really talk to anyone about this kind of thing as well, so it was really pleasant being able to talk to someone about this kind of thing. She and I are actually pretty alike as people. We both tend to keep our emotions to ourselves, but we really seemed to connect that day. She said that her grandpa always gave her crap about dyeing her hair, but right before he died, he wanted to dye his hair green. She dyed his hair and he was happy about it. She decided to dye her hair green for the funeral in honor of him. She told me that when her dad saw it, he started choking up and crying. She told me all of this without any walls up, and since then we've been pretty close and tell each other about everything.",,3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GAZ81GX
