The EMTs had to be called. It was a painful experience. I was rushed to the hospital to be treated. At least I got the day off of work. They gave me some drugs to take to prevent migraines. I haven't gotten a migraine ever since. I celebrated a week without a migraine by getting something to eat. I got a big steak at a fancy steakhouse. I had some beer with the steak. They were both delicious. The waitress was very nice. I gave her a big tip for her hospitality. I'm glad that no more migraines are occurring in my head. I hope I will never get one again.",,3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GYKO1G7
