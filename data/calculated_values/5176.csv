I had recently been promoted to a lead position. It was a meeting about a new ugrade to our electronic medical system. While the meeting was happening I started to feel weird. I started to have tingling and numbness. I had experienced it more and more. I knew it was a hemiplegic migraine. I had had these in the past. They often can mimic strokes. All of the sudden someone commented on how quiet I had been which is not like me, and I started to tear up. I realized I couldn't move. My face drooped, I couldn't stand. THey lowered me to the floor I work at a clinic so a triage team was called. Unfortunately, my coworker who knows best about my issues was not there and my doctor was not either, but another doctor assessed me I had a transient ischemic attack (TIA or small stroke) previously so an ambulance was called. The EMTs and fire department arrived. I was put on a stretcher and put into the elevator the whole time the EMTs told me to stop faking and told me I was having pseudo seizures. I was unable to talk.",3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GYKO1G7,3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GYKO1G7
