He always helped make facing life a little easier. No matter what I said or did all he showed was love. During the rougher times in life he was always by my side and helped me stay calm and think clearer. Those memories are what have fueled my decision. I greatly miss having a canine companion and after much research I have decided that a lab would be the best kind of dog to suit my lifestyle now. I particularly love the coloring on the chocolate labs and with a little luck I found my new doggy soul mate. I went to 3 different shelters and visited with many different dogs. While they are all adorable and I somewhat wish I could take them all home. There was something special about ""Sugar Bear"", even his name seems to fit perfectly. Once we met, it was literally love at first site. He is amazing and I feel so much happier having him in my life. Hands down the best decision I've ever made so far! I don't feel as depressed anymore now that I have a furry friend by my side. He makes my evening walks so much nicer and helps me feel safe. I love getting to cuddle with him at night after a long day. I can't believe I waited this long to adopt another dog honestly, but I am so happy that I finally did. I cannot picture life without my lil lab.",,3RYC5T2D74F66JJOEBXU0O1L6SJRPG
