When I was young, my family has a lot of dogs, it was like up to five dogs at the time. As far as I remember, I love dogs, they are apart of my life but I have never actually adopt my very own dog until now. I think it is a huge responsibility to take care of another life. Anything could go wrong if I didn't do it right because  just like any babies, puppy can easily get sick and need to be taught. I took that responsibility seriously. It took me a while to find a reputable breeder because I do not want to get my puppy from any irresponsible puppy mills. I only want a breeder who breeds responsible and take care of their dogs. The mama dog is beautiful. All of the puppies were beautiful. The moment the breeder called me to pick my puppy up, I remember it was AMAZING MOMENT. All the wait was worth it, my pup is beautiful, like an angel dog if that even a thing. I buy the best taste with the most nutrient food for my fur baby. I want my dog to have a very very good life because all dogs deserve it. I understand there are many many dogs in this world needs saving and I also plan to adopt a dog from shelter. However, I want my first dog to be the one I raise from A to Z. It's all miracle moment and no one can take it away from me. Every time I go home from work, when  I got tired, there is my fur baby to cheer me up. My pup maybe only a part of my life but to the pup, I am her whole world. I want her to have the best life possible.",3RYC5T2D74F66JJOEBXU0O1L6SJRPG,
