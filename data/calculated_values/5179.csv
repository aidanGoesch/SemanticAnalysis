I remember when I grew up, my family always had dogs and puppy around because we had such huge farm at the time. The most dogs we had at the time were 5 and they were all extremely attached me because I really enjoyed taking care of them and vice versa. It was even hard taking care of them with my family’s help back then.  At this stage of my life, I want to take a big step of adopting my very first puppy, all on my own. I feel I am ready for this huge responsibility to take care of another life. I started looking for a breeder because I specifically want a Chocolate Labrador Retriever. I found a reputable breeder and she said she would put me on the waiting list and let me know when her dog got pregnant. Fast forward until 5 months ago, best news ever, the breeder called me that her dog delivered 5 beautiful and healthy babies and one of them could be mine. I was filled with joyed and immediately asked if I could visit them. The mama dog and the puppies were beautiful and of courses I picked out a male Choc Lab . I followed up every week and 3 months later, he was ready to go home with me. When I arrived and saw him, I busted out with tears and couldn’t believe that he was mine. He is beautiful and no words can describe how happy I was and I still am. Every time I see my puppy, I recall the first moment I met him when he was tiny little pup and now, he grows so fast. He is so playful, eats a lot but not food aggressive because dog come from big litter can become food aggressive due to the nature of surviving instinct. He fills my day with happiness, he cheers me up after a long day at work. Cleaning after him is very exhausting but looking at those puppy eyes, I can’t complain. He loves bath, I can’t believe it. Most dogs hate it, and my dog enjoys it, it makes my life so much easier to bath him during these summer months because he is so actively. I have to say I’ve made one of the best decisions of my life by adopting my first puppy, and I think I’ll need to adopt another so that they’ll can become best friends and do not feel lonely.",3RYC5T2D74F66JJOEBXU0O1L6SJRPG,3RYC5T2D74F66JJOEBXU0O1L6SJRPG
