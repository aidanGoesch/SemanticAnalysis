It is fascinating how life sometimes pleases us with gifts like this, she in her children always had trouble keeping attention and consent in anything. The professors noticed that their grades were not able to rise since in the classes they did not pay enough attention to understand and at the time of taking the exam I did not know what to do. But when I realized this and I was able to talk to her teachers and see her notes, I started working to help her personally. I started teaching her at home, I was sending her to do attention exercises and I was looking on Google what I could do to help her. My goal has always been for her to be excellent and I know she will be. At the beginning it was very difficult for him to keep his concentration for a couple of hours, since shortly after starting something he got bored or fixed his attention on something else. It was very stressful to feel that at first nothing worked to help her. I tried everything I found on google, but there was no improvement. It was at that moment when I decided to go to a specialist, and with her we did everything necessary to improve her attention. After a time of moments of stress, highs and lows we finally started to see an improvement. And it was there that I saw a light in the darkness, at last my daughter was beginning to improve her path to success was clearing up. I continued persisting with exercises and practices at home, and her grades began to improve, after being a bad student, she began to be a regular student, passed all her subjects with good grades, the teachers congratulated her. He was able to graduate from high school and then enter university and thus fulfill his dreams",,337RC3OW06O885L7V39XK4H4JW9LVW
