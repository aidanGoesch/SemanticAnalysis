About a month ago i was testing for my red belt in tae kwon do. In order to achieve it I needed to demonstrate a lot of skills I learned. First I had to show all the forms I know. After this I had to demonstrate that I knew all of the skill. s After my forms I showed punches and kicks. And finally I had to show blocks. The blocks were the hardest part for me. I trained for months leading up to it and the test was over in a bit under an hour. Waiting to be awarded the red belt was the hardest part. I had others testing that same day and had to wait for them all to finish. When all was done I was awarded the belt. I am unsure if I will train much beyond it. I am getting older and my body is taking the brunt of it. I am in awe of those who continue to proceed later in life. For me though, red may be where I end up stopping.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JN9CD1D
