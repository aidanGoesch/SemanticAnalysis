I grew up in a household remind mom and dad were both really into fitness. My mom had recommended to me Tae Kwon Do so that's what I did. I fell in love with it right away and moved up the ranks. While other kids were at school practicing football and baseball I would be at the Dojo learning all I could. Fast forward about a month ago it was finally time for me to go for my red belt. Practice had become my life because achieving this belt meant everything to me. I went through my entire repertoire while filming myself. I wanted to see where I could improve. I took not and practiced what I needed.  At that point I felt that I had the discipline and skill necessary to achieve the rank. In the weeks leading up to this I continued to practice night and day. I felt muscles in my body that I didn't even know existed, but it all paid off in the end. When I receive my red belt it felt like a crowning achievement. To this day I'm still really proud of this and I plan on getting better and better in this amazing sport.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JN9CD1D
