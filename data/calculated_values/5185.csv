I train for approximately 3 hours, 4 days a week.  During this training, I'm expected to complete every kick, block, punch, and form that I've learned up to this point in my training.  I also have to learn 3 step sparring, which is learning how to fight someone, and counter the move they're doing when they attack you.  In addition to this, I have to run up to 5 miles, run stairs, and other conditioning, in order to prepare for my black belt test.  This training will continue on for another 5 months or so, until I am able to obtain a certain amount of time, certain amount of days training, certain classes taken, and a certain amount of tournaments entered and competed in.  Only then will I be allowed to test for my black belt.  I've heard from black belts that the actual test will last about 6 to 8 hours.  The reason they make us train so long and so hard in order to test for black belt is they want us to be in the best shape possible when we become black belts.  I agree with this thought process.  If we need to defend ourselves using Martial Arts, we need to be ready to do whatever is necessary in order to defend ourselves.  This is one of the reasons I enjoy going to tournaments.  I want to be able to defend myself using martial arts, should it ever be necessary.  In order to prepare to the best of my ability for this scenario, I feel it's necessary to fight other competitors in tournaments to see how I react to people attempting to attack me.  In all reality, I hope I never have to learn what I've learned in martial arts in a real life scenario.  I enjoy training to keep me active, physically.  However, I feel confident that I can apply the skills I've learned, should it ever become necessary.",3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JN9CD1D,
