One of the intentions that I set for myself is to be able to support my children in living in their truth. My daughter recently has begin to find herself and she's developing he own style and figuring out what she likes. She struggles academically but she is very artistic. As mother's we want the best for our children and for some reason we tend to think that that means that they have to go to college and we try to keep them in a box. So I set the intention of allowing my children to create their own reality, and about a month ago she came to be and said that she wants me to help start her own business. I felt excited and honored. I never thought that we would get to this point. I got pregnant when i was 15 and our relationship has been rocky every since. I think that not having a relationship with her dad has contributed to the problems that she has had over the years, but I think that she is finally finding herself and creating and identity for herself. I think that this lip gloss line that she wants to create will further help her with her self actualization and I look forward to being apart of it. When the time comes I want her to leave the nest knowing who she is, what she wants, and how to get it. I may not have been emotionally available to her during the majority of her childhood because of my own issues but I can make sure that she gets what she needs for the rest of her childhood. I want to make sure that she feels purposeful. This has definitely been a fulfilling day.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JNAND1Q
