I was stressed because I needed a full-time job as soon as possible but didn't have any luck finding one. I had been applying to jobs for many months prior to that moment but nobody wanted to hire me because I was still in school. At the time, I was working part-time as a server at a restaurant. Anyone who has ever been a server knows that it's a stressful job to have because you never know how much money you will make. Some days I would take home almost two hundred dollars in a busy shift and other times, I would stand around for hours at work and not make a single dollar. Sometimes, I would even be sent home early because it was slow and there were no customers. This doesn't help when you have bills and can barely afford to take care of yourself. I started to become very depressed because my bills were piling up more and more. I only made enough money to buy groceries and get gas. I was unable to pay my bills nor do anything fun. I was upset because I was in grad school trying to get my Master's Degree so I could get a full-time job that paid me enough money for me to be able to pay my bills and not have to stress and worry about where my next dollar was going to come from. Eventually, after months of searching for work and stressing and being depressed about not making enough money, i finally got a call from a non-profit mental health agency. I went to an interview the next day after I got the call, and was hired the same day! I was so happy because it happened only a few days after I finished school and graduated. It was the good news that I had been waiting so long for. Getting the job helped me cope with my depression better. I knew I would be able to pay y bills and take care of the things I needed to take care of.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FMD81,
