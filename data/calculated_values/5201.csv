My husband and I aren’t rich, and we didn’t have the money to go out the next day to buy a new one at $1000.  We had to wait about a week to get the refrigerator.  In between that time, we had no means of keeping things cool or frozen.  I had to go to the store every day to buy a few bags of ice just to keep what we were having for dinner that night cold.   I am very careful as not to waste a thing in the kitchen.  If I make a whole roasted chicken, I use all the meat in a few different meals, then I take the carcus and boil it down for broth, and keep the broth in the freezer to make soups or whatever.  While the refrigerator was broken, there was no way to do that.  I was using the last bits of meat for a sandwich, and throwing the bones in the trash.  My husband got mad that I was wasting the bones...took the bones out of the trash and started to eat the TINY bits of meat off of each bone that had been thrown away.  I stood there in total disbelief at him eating something I threw away.  I was grossed out and disgusted.  I got angry and stormed outside for a bike ride around the neighborhood.  Not paying attention to where I was riding, my bike tires went off of the curb and I flipped my bike and went flying into the gravel.  I walked home bloodied and in pain.  My face was scratched up as were my knees.  It was a horrible evening, but the arguing stopped when I got home.  We also got a new refrigerator in a few days after that event, and there is no more wasted food.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FQD85
