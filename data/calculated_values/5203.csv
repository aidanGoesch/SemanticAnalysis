I was surprised when I ""turned on"" my marketing efforts, that they produced results very fast. I managed to bring on new clients, without having to prospect for them. When I had a client approach me, out of the blue, and request my services, it was a ground-breaking day for me. I realized that I had the ability and knowledge to be an expert in my field. Even if it's only on a small scale, people are seeking me out, rather than me going out and convincing people that they would need my services. I think that, for the first time, the idea of starting my own business as a primary form of income has started to look like a possibility. It was exciting and also a bit nerve-wracking. I hope that I can continue this trajectory. I would hate to let down a client and lose their faith. I need recommendations and word-of-mouth in order to grow in this field. I am also nervous that my services may not meet expectations. I think I have a case of imposter syndrome around this particular thing. I'm looking forward to getting to work and growing my business. I was surprised with the pace of growth. It's pretty impressive but daunting!",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRBBG8DS
