We started drinking and become extremely intoxicated by the end of the night.  When we returned to his apartment his girlfriend became upset at my friend's drunken state.  Things got out of control and my friend's girlfriend was becoming more and more angry.  Things continued to escalate.  I tried to intervene and calm the situation, but voices continued to rise and there was nothing I could do.  She actually became physically violent with him and things were so out of hand and noisy that the police were called to the scene.  The neighbor that called the police also showed up and it was just a mess.  Ugh, nosy people!  By this point the girlfriend had locked herself in the bathroom and the police had to convince her to come out so they could talk.  She finally did and things truly calmed down by then.  Luckily, no charges were filed and the police left once they knew that my friend would come home with me to allow the girlfriend time to cool down.  Boy, it was drama filled!  The night become sort of iconic in our eyes and we even have a catchphrase to remember it by.  ""Don't drink and go home to a sober girl!""  This is not a night I will soon forget.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRBBGD8X
