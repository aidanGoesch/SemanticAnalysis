Since I was really bored myself, I invited him out to the bar and said I'd pay for a couple of pitchers for us - an offer no man refuses. As usual, his girlfriend got really mad about it and started harping at him over it. We went anyway; I came back with a bit of a buzz, he came back more drunk than before. His girlfriend was waiting at my place, and they started arguing again. At this point, I started to feel a little guilty for directly influencing the actions that led to their bickering, but at the same time I felt she was being a little dramatic because it wasn't that big of a deal to go out, have a couple of drinks and come back. Then me and my friend decided to hang out longer, and we drove over to his place. We got bored and went out to the bar again, and by the end of the night we were really wasted. On our way back we were being loud and belligerent, urinating all over the street and shouting out statements of ignorance for the world to hear. By the time we got back, his girlfriend calmed down and was in a more cheerful mood... but that didn't last long. Over the course of this drunken adventure, a catchphrase was born: ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" It is a loud expression of joy and excitement, and sounds identical to Joe Rogan's joke involving Ludacris. Well, it didn't take long for ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" to get on his girlfriend's nerves - and after repeatedly telling him to ""shut the f*** up"", she got frustrated and clocked him in the jaw. Suddenly, the mood in the room started to become tense - and of course, my friend and I, being the people that we are, tried to deescalate the tension by shouting ""OoOoO oOoOo!"", but his girlfriend was not having any of it. She proceeded to punch him again. I knew it wasn't going to end well, because my friend is not the type of person to let something like that slide once, let alone twice. She got clocked back this time, got really mad and tried to fight him. Obviously there is a huge size and strength disadvantage for her, so I intervened and broke it up - almost becoming the target of my friend's fury in the process because instead of leaving she tried to use the fact I was restraining him to her advantage. Eventually she left, we went back to having a good time, but then later she decided to come back, being the sophisticated, intelligent university graduate that she is. She ruined our good time again, and my friend tried to peel off in her car. The moment he tried to do that, by some stroke of chance an undercover police cruiser was driving by and heard his girlfriend yell ""pull him over!"" Somehow after an hour of going back and forth with the half dozen or so cops that showed up, he managed to avoid arrest. She ended up leaving, and we ended up with quite a story to remember. They broke up about a month later, which gives validity to ""bros before hoes"". ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" lives on, even to this day.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRBBGD8X
