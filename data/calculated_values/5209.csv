My whole family was coming in to visit and see the graduation ceremony. All the problems and choices I would have to make after graduation slipped from my mind because I was so excited. There were a lot of people at the ceremony and I was just one of many waiting to get their diploma. After the speeches the dean started calling names in alphabetical order. I nervously waited my turn since I was always anxious about appearing on stage, even if it was just to grab a piece of paper. My name was called and as smoothly as I could walked up and onto the stage. After shaking a few hands and grabbing my diploma I started to walk to the other side of the stage. My foot must have caught my robe in a weird way and I fell forward while walking. The crowd gasped as I quickly picked myself up and briskly walked off the stage. Thankfully the ceremony went on as normal and I think most people forgot what happened pretty quickly. I was and to a degree still am embarrassed by what happened. It didn't help that my family joked about it during the after party and dinner. I realized though that it wasn't nearly as bad as it felt when it happened. That over time this would become a funny story to share with friends.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRR6B8DT
