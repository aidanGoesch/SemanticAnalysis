It was a long and what felt like an endless road. I gave everyone I knew an invitation to my graduation. I knew when I was getting my diploma It would be a proud moment so the more people there to support me the better. Finally the day came. I got dressed and grabbed my cap and gown, then headed to the venue. I was sitting in my seat waiting for my name to be called. I turned around to find my family in the bleaches. I waved when I finally saw them. Then I heard my name and headed for the stage. As I reached the top step, I came crashing down on my face. I knew I shouldn't have worn my heels that day. I quickly got it, grabbed my diploma and walked off stage with my head down. It was the most embarrassing moment of my life and I feel I will never ever forget it. It is still a story that is being told and family gatherings.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRR6B8DT,
