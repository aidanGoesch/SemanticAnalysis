I went to the kitchen to prepare our food as she already due to delivery. I was going to prepare friend rice and chicken. Not long after that, my wife came out of the room. She came directly to the kitchen. She gave me a kiss and said she was feeling pressed and needs to use the toilet, so off she goes. She got to the toilet and not long after that she shouted. i was terrified, i ran straight to the toilet. i guess what. She broke her bottle. I quick packed her stuff as we were already prepared. rushed her to the hospital. When we go there. We were attended to immediately as it was an emergency. She was takwn to the labor room. I was scared as hell as it was the birth of my first child. After 30 minutes or so, the doctor came out to congratulate me. It was a bouncing baby boy and he looks exactly like his mother. We predicted earlier that the baby would look like her. I just could believe what i saw.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRSMLD85
