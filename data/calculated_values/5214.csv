I was honored and blessed to give birth to a beautiful, healthy baby and couldn't wait to share my journey with my child.  Labor were relatively easy and seeing my daughter after anticipating her arrival brought me so much joy. However I began to feel a bit different from usual. Sure, we all have bad days and no one is 100 percent happy all the time but my level of happiness started to decrease. The beautiful baby I had became a afterthought as I only wanted to curl up in bed and just sleep my life away. I had little to no energy , my emotions started to significantly go down and I just did not care anymore. Not only about my child but myself and others around me. Thanks to my husband who helped me tremendously during the days I want to give up, including giving up my own child! It was a very emotional time and I finally worked up the courage to see the doctor about what I were feeling. He told me I was suffering post partum depression. Beforehand I looked up the signs and most of symptoms ticked off the checkbox. He began medication for me and offered therapy if I choose to go that route. I accepted it because I refused to live my life feeling numb constantly. I wanted to be here for my daughter, loved ones, and took active steps to make it sure I am able to provide emotional care. To me it was long journey to break out of that dark place and people were amazed that I ""snapped"" out it so quickly but they did not realize how hard I fought to be where I am today.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRUCVD8X
