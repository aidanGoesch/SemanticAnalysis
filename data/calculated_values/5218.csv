He was so relatively young, very healthy. His death came as a very large surprise and shock. He was energetic, full of life, and working on a project at the time. He had no disease, healthy as a horse.  Death was far from all of our minds. Him being instantly gone from our lives left an enormous void. I think of his passing often. We're told, ""He'd want you to be happy"", but the truth is-it's a huge part of your heart ripped out suddenly. I feel the loss every time I see the fences we built as children, the landscaping he did when he was at home, or read a familiar topic from an author he liked.  I think of him when I am cooking, and notice the ingredients he loved, or imagine his calm voice in a discussion of current events. It will take time to heal. I wasn't prepared, nor do I think I will ever be ready for people in my life to die.  I had read and seen death, but mentally, everyone close was protected, immune, and I foolishly told myself ""it won't happen to me"".  There's so much more I would have said, time I would have spent, if I were preparedDeath takes so much energy, and I still have to learn to accept it, and love those in my life while they are here.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRZYE8DO,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRZYE8DO
