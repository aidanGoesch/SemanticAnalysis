It was Cheryl‘s 23rd birthday a and it was at the Outback Steakhouse in Waikiki near the Ala Wai harbor. The food was great and the party was awesome.  Prior to meeting up with my cousin Cheryl, I bought her a birthday gift about a mile or two away. It was a fancy glass sculpture with tendrils of different colors within that is quite mesmerizing. After about a couple of hours of eating, drinking, I suggested to Lola to take a walk with me to Ala Wai Harbor and watch the sunset. It‘s so crazy and crowded in Waikiki with all the tourists, yet just 2 blocks away it‘s  peaceful and seems remote. Neither one of us still had not decided which city to go to or even which state. We talked at length of the pros and cons of different locations so quite some time. It was well after dark when we decided together whoever got the first job on the mainland the other would follow. That‘s when I realized that the little glass sculpture was still in my pocket! I took it out  of the little box and I showed it to her.  I told her, I forgot to give this to Cheryl during the birthday party, I‘ll get her something else later. I said to her seriously, “This scuplture represents the delicate beginnings of our friendship and the tendrils of colors are the future events that we will experience together as our lives weaves together.“I put it back in the box and handed it to her while saying, “Please be gentle.“After about a year upon graduating, I got a job first in Seattle WA, Lola did come, and agreed to marry me. The glass sculpture is up on the mantle piece which reflects the glow of fireplace flames and our love that ever renews itself with oxygen.",,3S3AMIZX3VRTBKRFR5G4BZLAHIQCD3
