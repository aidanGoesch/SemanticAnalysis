On the 23rd of May, 2019, My cousin Sarah Jones was celebrating her birthday, which brings us the friends and family together. Sarah ofcourse is the talk of the town due to her generous lifestyle and beauty. She dragged me all the way in getting the party set. I had gotten a nice Gucci footwear as a present for her.   At evening as people get around to start the jamz, i suddenly sited a lady, so elegant and sparkling at the corner of the room. i was dazed at such beauty. I ask my cousin Sarah who she was, i was informed of how great Linda is.  I was so desperate to be around her and setup a conversation.  Sarah made a quick introduction which set me on a good to start gist. she was so lovely to be with.  Well the funniest and craziest thing i did was to give her the gucci Footwear i intended to give the celebrant (Sarah). She smiled, obviously knowing the footwear was not originally hers, but a good heart give her. After much dancing and drinks, we decided to go and enjoy a little privacy in other to gist better.  I wonder how Linda could easy get my heart. so funny and loving.   Planted a peck on her cheek, and when i saw the reaction, i made a way to plant a kiss on her lips, so sweet a day. i caught her attention, and inthe nearest week, we were in love.  And till now she is my lovely baby girl.",3S3AMIZX3VRTBKRFR5G4BZLAHIQCD3,3S3AMIZX3VRTBKRFR5G4BZLAHIQCD3
