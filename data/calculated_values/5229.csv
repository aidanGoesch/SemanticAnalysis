The wedding happened last year in October. It was an amazing night that impacted our lives forever because of all of the powerful moments that happened. It was a really hectic and crazy build up the months before the wedding. My Dad recently got diagnosed with heart failure in the recent months before the wedding around august. He got very sick and was bedridden and unable to really move, function or eat. It was a rough time for my family because we didn't think he would be able to walk down the isle for my sisters wedding. It was a miracle that in the building weeks before the wedding he was able to start getting to move again. My whole family went to the beach and pushed my dad in a wheel chair to see the sunset. When we got to the end of the pier I think he really appreciated the world and what it still has to offer him. That's when he got up and got motivated to try and make it down the isle for my sisters wedding. the following weeks he started exercising daily. We started slowly walking around my neighborhood to get him moving again. Before we new it he started lifting weights and jogging. It was an amazing process to see him get stronger over time. It was an absolute miracle that he is now healthy, and was able to take my sisters arm and walk her down the isle. It was one of my most memorable moments seeing them make it down together.",3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR6MX4L8,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR6MX4L8
