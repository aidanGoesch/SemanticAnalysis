We loaded up both of our cars with all of his things and headed to his college which was 3 hours away.  This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive and just sad.  It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal.  We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car.  My wife finished driving him to school to unload all of his stuff.  My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home.  I didn't even get to see his dorm room or campus or anything.  I miss him a lot as everything just seems different now that he is gone.  I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time.  He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us.  The car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed.  My wife drove his bike down a week later.  The entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp.  He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down.  Wish we had just waited 2 more weeks to move him in.",338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKH5LAHZ,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKH5LAHZ
