We were excited to settle in for a few days deep into the mountains, where we could unplug and experience the quiet and lushness of pure nature. We stayed in a cabin next to a stream, falling asleep to the sounds of local flora and fauna each night. We spent each day lounging about and getting a feel for a different sort of life. Each day, we were a little happier. It was a joy to use our bodies and minds for something other than work. On our last day, we decided to try to do a nearby hike in hopes of seeing the sun set from a particularly choice location. We got a tip from a local and decided to set out in the late afternoon. As we left our cabin, a few local dogs seemed to just understand where we were heading and suddenly followed us. After traipsing alongside us for a few moments, they rushed ahead and started to lead us up a beautiful winding path. They played and trotted in front of us, taking us through a dense path of beautiful trees. As they led us up the mountain, the sun began to fall. They would stop and play if we fell behind, sometimes posing regally as the sun continued to drop in the sky. It was an overwhelmingly serene experience--we felt at one with the day, the world, the dogs, the country. We finished the ascent and sat with our one-day canine friends, full of calm and ready to return home with an astonishing memory of natural connection.",,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR82WL4M
