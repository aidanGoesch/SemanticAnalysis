It's a way for all of us to hang out and get lost in another world.  I think we all enjoy it because we can forget about any real world problems we have in our daily life.  That's why what happened two months ago is bothering me so much.  Getting everyone's schedule to line up has been a bit of a nightmare recently.  Work, the holidays, and real life has intruded.  The campaign we had going on has completely stalled.  I keep going back and forth on whether or not I should play with another group of friends or to wait it out now.  I'm just not sure on what I plan to do.  If I start up with another group of friends then the dynamic we had going on will be lost and we would have to start over.  I am leaning towards waiting it out though.  I wouldn't feel comfortable continuing on with other people it would almost feel as though I am betraying them.  I feel like I am stressing out over the campaign more than I would anything else in my life.  Next week I am meeting up with one of my friends that was part of the D&D group.  I plan on testing out what she thinks.",,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR94ZL4U
