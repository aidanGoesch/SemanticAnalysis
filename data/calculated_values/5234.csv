Birthdays are more than just singing “Happy Birthday”. Celebrating one's birthday whether it be a first birthday, a thirteenth birthday, a sixteenth birthday, a twenty first birthday or an fiftieth birthday are all often substantial and considered to be an  accomplishment.  Birthdays may just be any other day in any other culture but, the American culture does more to celebrate one's day of birth and often celebrates them by going over the top. A birthday, commonly known as an occasion, is a celebration of the day of which a person was born. my 31st birthday was 2 months ago, i woke up that morning not being happy, i was broke and i didn't have money on me and this made me really sad. this day happen to fall on a weekend and i usually like celebrating my birthday but since i didn't have money i just decided to stay inside my room all day watching tv. it was almost four pm i was fast asleep, i got a call from my friend Dave. Dave was my housemate, he came inside my room, made me dress up and i thought we was taking me out. we got to the rooftop condo in my city aand as i entered through the door, i saw balloons and other decorations, i was surprise as if my tongue was tied. my friends and family well all present there/ my partner was also there. as i took a step further everybody yelled happy birthday.  I usually do not like surprises but this one was so well done that I could not resist. i had to party along and there was enough food and drinks. we party all night and the dj gave us good music. i had to give some appreciation speech cause i was expecting it. i thanked my friends and family for the birthday party.",,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHRIYL4LW
