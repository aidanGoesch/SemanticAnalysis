He has been in a lot of pain, and it got to the point where we had to see a doctor. The first doctor, our primary, referred him to a specialist. Tests were run, and he was referred to another specialist. That specialist then referred him to another specialist. See the pattern here? He saw our primary care physician first, then an orthopedic doctor. Next was a pain management doctor. After that, it was a vascular surgeon. That doctor referred him to a rheumatologist. That doctor has referred him to an oncologist. Everything was fine until this. We knew he was in pain. We knew something was wrong. We were not expecting to be referred to an oncologist. He has had so many tests, and has had physical therapy as well as massage therapy. Nothing is helping him, and now we have this added fear. The appointment is in two weeks, and we are on pins and needles waiting to see what is going on.",3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LE8PVTDH,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LE8PVTDH
