He hurt his back while at work, and had to get surgery for it. The surgery isn't going to be cheap either, so it's going to take a huge chunk out of our payroll. I wasn't happy at all to hear that. But he needed to get it done, so I don't get a choice. When we got there we spent a day exploring the downtown Washington D.C. It was huge! And it was nice exploring it. We had fun. A lot more fun than I thought that we would have. We saw some national monuments, and they were amazing. Just the best. I thought the trip was were worth it. It was just that great of a trip. I'm glad we went.",,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEDBZDTI
