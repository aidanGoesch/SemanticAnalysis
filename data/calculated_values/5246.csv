Heck, I was just a baby when we got her at nine years old. Picked her out at the shelter myself and took her to the new dog park. I could never say that she was unloved or unwanted because honestly, she was the only thing that really made my life feel complete and happy. It's not my favorite thing to talk about. Her passing away I mean. God this was two months ago and I can still feel myself tear up about it. I guess it's because I've never really had loss before and I may never truly get over her. She was with me when we went to the zoo at the new house when I was fifteen and she had just had her sixth birthday. I'm twenty three now and still can hear her foot steps as she leaps down the stairs to say hello. There were signs of things. When we went to try a Puppachino at the new Starbucks and she didn't run to get there the same way she used to. So many things she accompanied me with, so many great times and experiences I'll always remember. Two months ago I walked in to pet her head as she fell back asleep after having a hard time. Two months ago I can still feel the way her body felt as I realized it was limp. It's still really difficult to think about. I'm actually grateful to get this off of my chest though. Rest in Peace Chloe, I love you.",,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEE5JDTR
