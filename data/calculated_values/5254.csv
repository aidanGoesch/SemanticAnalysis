Not saying I deserved anything of the sort, but a little bit of sunshine in my life would have been just the thing. Right on cue, I got a call a few weeks back from my brother in Oregon -- he was on vacation and wanted to come visit. Can you believe it? We've both been so busy over the last year we haven't gotten together at all. I spent way too much time tidying up the house in preparation for his visit, not to mention I went a little crazy with the sweets baking like I always do. What's a few pounds for a good time, anyway? He arrived two weeks ago on a rainy Friday afternoon with his niece at his side. I couldn't believe how much she's grown since we last saw each other! I had planned to take them out to the zoo (she loves animals like nothing else) but the rain forced me to make a change of plan. I broke out one of the old board games me and my brother used to war over as children, and we all set up shop near the living room window. Naturally, I went easy on them (and I would never admit to being beat!). We had great fun, and it was wonderful to see little reflections of our childhood selves in her -- even down to the big huffy pout when things didn't go her way. We all lost ourselves in the game so much we barely even touched the food. I'll have to pack some of it up and hand it out in the break room at work, unless I really want to balloon up. It was long after sundown by the time we gave our farewells, along with a promise to get together again next month. We all made some precious memories that day, and I can't wait to see my niece continue to grow!",,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEPQ6DTV
