It was mostly just a friendly hangout. I was mostly there to be the sober sitter, but took a microdose due to all the positive energy happening. It was not really what I expected, but it was still worthwhile. We didn't really come together and have fun, everyone did their own thing. I meditated in a shed for a couple hours while one of my friends had some troubles on the come up. It really did make me realize some things about my anxiety that have helped me better cope with it to this day. Actually, to be honest the lessons I learned that day seem to be fading, but the memory is still there.  It also meant a lot to me to reconnect with old high school friends. The most memorable part was still my buddy freaking out over ants and saying ""They out here man."" Had to be there but it was hilarious.  Sadly, we had a falling out since then, me and the friend who said that. He is just a selfish asshole who talks mad shit if you hang out with any more than just him. I am still a person with severe panic disorder. At least this day helped remind me that despite how negatively I may feel, I am still a person. I am still myself, whoever that may be, I do not know yet.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE54RAXX,
