He was such a force on this earth, everyone that knew him, had a funny story to tell about him.  He was loved by so many people in the small town I grew up in and anytime anyone found out he was my uncle they would beam a huge smile and tell me about their time spent while he was alive.  Several months ago, I came across an old Facebook post of a cousin on my mother's side of the family.  She had mentioned being at the bar my uncle was in with his friends on the night of his death.  He was thrown from the passenger sent out of the front dash because he wasn't wearing a seat belt.  His friend was obviously too drunk to be driving, but survived because he did have his seat belt on.  In my cousin's post, as I said before, she mentioned that she was there and that as he and his friend were leaving, she thought to herself, that it was a bad idea for them to be on the road and maybe someone should call cab.  This post is so frustrating for me.  I want so badly to have met this man.  My oldest son looks exactly like him and, oh, the pain when someone see him and says so.  I always hear, ""Your uncle would have just been so tickled with him (my son).""  Yes, I believe he would be and would have been with me, too, as a child growing up.  I feel robbed of his presence in my life, even though I understand that he made the decisions that lead to his death.  Now with the added insult of knowing another family member was there and didn't make a effort help adds even more sickening feelings into my already overflowing pot of emotions.  Unfortunately, my cousin is now also deceased for nearly a year and I am angry and frustrated at the fact I can't pick her brain about that night or find any closure on my anger with her for not helping because she's dead, too.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE5UNAX9,
