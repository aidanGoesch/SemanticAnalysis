I've never really played for anyone. I've always just played in the comfort of my own home. About five months ago, I was invited to perform at a show. I was so nervous. I nearly turned it down. but my friends helped me. They talked me through and I showed up to the show. This was a turning point for me. I learned so much. I gained a new triumph from it. This experience has helped me reach new heights that I never dreamed possible before. I'm getting ready to perform again. We've got people actually requesting for me to perform as the they said they've never seen such a clarinet player before. The future looks so bright.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE7L2XAV
