I asked them for a raise but they refused. They told me that their finances were very low! They said they had no additional funds to give raises this year. So I did some research. I found out they lied to me and they did have the money to give me a raise. They were so impressed by my detective skills they also gave me a promotion! What a week! So I got a raise and a promotion at work! I could not believe it! So I am very happy now at my place of employment. I am thankful for the raise and the promotion. And I no longer hold any resentment I once did. I go to work happy everyday now. And I no longer care that they lied to me at the start.,,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKHFWAHU
