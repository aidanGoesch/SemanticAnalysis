I was so scared for the child to come at first. I had no idea what being a mother was going to be like. Not to mention, I had no idea how to raise a child because I never felt like I got raised properly. My mother was so excited for the child and wanted to see him soon after he was born. My mother and I did not get along. I did not want her to see the new child and I had no idea why she was reaching out to me. I made plans to go see her then soon after he was born. I was really nervous because I didnt think she would ever be there for him. Once there, my mother explained how sorry she was for everything in my life and how she was always to busy. She wanted to be there for my new child. She loved him even though she didnt know him yet. I could see just how smitten she was for him. She loved him very much. She offered us lunch and started to get out ice cream. She wanted to celebrate. I had some ice cream with her and she fed my child his regular food. It turned out to be quite a nice day after all.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYEHN6AXQ
