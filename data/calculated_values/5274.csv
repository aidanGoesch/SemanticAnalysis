Because my siblings had already left the house and I was going to be leaving for college the following fall, my parents were ready to downsize. It was an emotional decision because my siblings and I had been raised in this home and my parents had lived there before any of us were even born. So last winter we set our sights on fixing anything that needed fixing in order to put our home up for sale. This included painting the walls, a new roof, and new siding in some areas. At the end of winter, our house was ready for the real estate market. We were all very anxious about putting the house on the market. My parents began looking for a new place to live and my siblings and I were trying to imagine a world in which we did not come home to the house we had grown up in and made so many memories in. After a couple of months on the market and a price drop, the home finally had an offer at the beginning of summer. But that is also where the headache began for myself and my parents. The people who put in the offer made too many demands including leaving some furniture and appliance items that we had planned to take with. After we conceded to some of what they wanted, the process of them getting verified to actually by the house turned in to a long drawn out process. In fact, mid way through summer my parents were just ready to be done with it as they had envisioned it going much smoother. My parents had to resign documents many times and were continuously told that the final offer might not go through, so they were stuck between purchasing their new home or waiting. Finally, at the tail end of summer, just as I was heading off to college, the offer went through and my parents were given 30 days to leave the home. By that point, I was already preparing to leave for college so it didn't seem to take as much of a toll on me as I thought it would. My parents were so fed up with how the process went, that they too were ready to say goodbye. Looking back on it, the home really didn't get the emotional goodbye I thought it should.",,3SB5N7Y3O4QCTC6QHFOSMJM655HG0K
