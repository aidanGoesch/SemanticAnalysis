I really thought it was going to be emotionally harder than it was. This was the house in which we raised our children. It was the first home we ever bought. We started sorting through belongings six months before we planned to close. Getting rid of stuff and narrowing down what mattered, made the process easier later. I took a week for each of the really cluttered areas: the garage, the attic and the shed. In the spring, we knew that we had to pack and move everything in every room. We already knew everything was being kept that was in a room at that point. All we had to do was decide what was going into storage and what was being moved to the new house. I took a room a day to pack so that it was not incredibly overwhelming, and I could leave important rooms, like our bedroom and the kitchen, for the last week. We spent the last three weeks before closing just moving boxes to storage and to the new house. We unpacked at each move. By the time we got to closing, the house was empty and the new house was full and fully livable. The final closing date came as more of a relief than a sad and emotional date, as I had feared. We felt like we had spent six months moving, and we had, but the final process was organized and not as chaotic as prior moves.",,3SB5N7Y3O4QCTC6QHFOSMJM655HG0K
