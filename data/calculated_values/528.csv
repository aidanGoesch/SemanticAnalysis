I was able to become certified in something that helped my resume grow. And it added to my experience. Thanks to this new certification on my resume. I was able to apply to several other positions with other companies. These are places that I wasn't able to apply to before. I wasn't sure if I was actually going to leave my job or not. I just wanted to keep my options open. It had been a while and I hadn't heard back from any of the places I applied to. So I just figured that they must not be hiring. And that I would probably be stuck where I was for a while. However, I unexpected received a phone call one day with an amazing offer. They were very interested in my experience. And thanks to my new certification from my former company, I was able to recieve a much better offer/salary. In the end, even though I received a raise and promotion from my former job, I ended up benefiting more from leaving and going with a new company.",338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKHFWAHU,
