It allows me to be a child, in a way. It's fun. It relieves stress. Plus, it's just good exercise. My girlfriend, I, and my friend went to a water park. The wait was rough, but that's to be expected. It was a warm day. We were able to get on rides after a long wait. I didn't really mind too much. It was fun to just be in good company. It was fun to experience the journey. I loved spending time with them. The food was pretty great too, so that didn't hurt. We also played in the wave pool, as an added bonus. I think it was a journey that I won't soon forget.",,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6KIOYIT
