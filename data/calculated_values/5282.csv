It started early, since the show started at 8. I know that people like to get there early and I wanted to make sure everything was ready. First, I went to Wal-Mart and bought some spray paint. Then I went home and measured the width of my van. I figured that that would be the largest anoint of parking space needed. Then I took a measuring tape and made a small line with the paint. This way I would know where I should spray the full lines at and it would look nice and neat. I made approximately 50 spaces altogether. I have a pretty large front yard. By this time it was late afternoon so I made lunch. After, I used the paint to make large wooden signs informing people of tree parking. I put one in the front yard, and several more spread out down the street. By this time it was about 6. I went to the store and got change,both bills and actual coins. Then I went home and got ready got the excitement. The first people came about 730. Starting with them, I'd simply mention that closer parking cost more and ask how much they had. By 930 every spot had been filled, and I almost had $700 in my pocket. Plus I'd met some really cool people during the night. The icing on the cake was being about to listen to the show.",,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6LC8YI2
