I have front yard space at my apartment complex and usually the landlord sells parking for large events like football games at the stadium.  The landlord didn't want to sell parking for the event, but he did ask that I sell a large spot for $100 to his friend who has a winnebago-type vehicle.  That large vehicle wasn't due into the lot until 2 hours before the event.  I wasn't sure what to charge for parking spots, and I wasn't sure how many spots I could sell.  At the beginning of the day I was hoping to make $300 by selling 10 spots for $30 each.  I sold my first spot for $30 at 11am for the 7pm concert.  I later change the price and starting charging $40 per spot.  Then I talked to my neigbors down the block who had open areas in the front yard of their apartment complexes.  I told them I would give them $20 of the $40 for each parking spot I sold on their lots.  Later in the day someone paid me $30 just to park for 2 hours so they could attend a pre-concert event.  It was a long, active day with many interactions with people.  The winnebago-type vehicle showed up late and was much bigger than I anticipated it being, but we were able to fit it in. I ended up making $670 dollars, which exceeded my expectations.  I enjoyed the enterpreneurial aspects of the day and then later I got to listen to the Garth Brooks concert from my front yard.",3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6LC8YI2,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6LC8YI2
