Recently he graduated from kindergarten, and I was assigned an important task over the summer. I had to decide whether he should continue to attend the school in his district, or transfer him to an honor's school that invited him due to his high performance and grades. I didn't have a lot of time to decide, because the honor's school has very small classes of about 10-13 students. I had to weigh a lot of pros and cons. On one hand, the honor's school would help academically. But my son's personality is such that he tends to worry, and I didn't want him to be overworked. I think it's important for a child to enjoy being a child, you know? Also, he had made friends throughout kindergarten, and with him being an only child I feel like friends are even more important for his socialization skills. He doesn't have a lot of opportunity to talk to children his own age outside of school. Ultimately I decided to keep him enrolled in his current school. I was nervous about this, but when I told my son, he was very excited. I do take how he feels about this decision to heart, since after all, his life is what is impacted most. But any doubts I had were quickly put to rest. Later that week, I found my son's scribble pad for art, and saw a new doodle. He had drawn himself and wrote ""I am very happy"" across the top. That made me very happy, too, and I'm certain I'll remember that event for years to come.",3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6N1VIYP,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6N1VIYP
