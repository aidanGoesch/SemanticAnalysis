It was late in the afternoon and we were supposed to pass by the grocery stores to pick some grocery. We were expecting her father that day. He had been deployed and we had not seen him for a year. we were both very excited . As we were passing town, it was raining heavily. On our way, my daughter sported a puppy who looked homeless and was being rained on. she insisted I stop to pick it. i told her somebody will do it as we were in a big hurry. she insisted but i drove on anyway. When i arrived home, she was in a bad spirit despite her dad having arrived. On being asked, she told her dad she wanted to request the puppy. we drove her back and honored her request. the puppy had been taken to the animal shelter. She insisted we go there and inquire. we went and we were given the puppy. on getting the puppy, she hugged the  puppy and cried tears of joy. we went home with it that day. I was very touched.",,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6WVOIYF
