Growing up, he was cold and distant, much more interested in his work and his life than he was in mine or the rest of his family.  As the years went on, I did not include him in much of our lives.  I felt resentment and that he would be the same type of grandfather that he was as a father.  I did not want my children to have this negative experience in their lives.  We did see him some as I felt I should include him in the big events in our lives as he was my father.  Last Spring, he came to visit.  I was actually happy he was visiting.  There were good times with him growing up and I missed those and that side of him.  I did love that side of him but I always felt conflicted.  My 3 boys were older now and I was less concerned about his effect on them as they had their own lives in school and with friends now.  My oldest son expressed an interest  in visiting his grandfather.   While I was hesitant at first, they had plans on things they wanted to do together and it was only for one day and back the next morning.  The visit went very well and my son told me Grandpa wanted to play the guitar like I did when he visited us.  This was quite a change for dad from his younger years.   My son's visit was 4 months ago and I have seen dad since.  I have come to realize he has changed for the better with the years.  He now is interested in spending time with his family.  I never doubted that my father loved me but I see he also loves my boys.  We have included dad more in our lives in the last 4 months and it has gone well.  I am happy our relationship has taken this turn and I get to have the father I wished he would have been when I was younger and my boys have grandpa.  We will continue to see more of each other.  This is a very pleasant surprize this year!",,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN4ZA3
