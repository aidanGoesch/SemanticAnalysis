It advanced my career but hurt my health. I had to quit my job to take care of myself. It was a tough decision but it was the best decision of my life. I got a bit healthier after a week. I got a lot healthier after a month. I guess it was the stress of the job that made my sick. I decided to work at a gym. This won't be too stressful and will help me get myself in good shape. I have helped a lot of people get back in shape. I am the talk of the gym. I am happy because of this. I hope they continue to be in good shape. They have made me proud. I have made them proud.",,30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B9XBHWM
