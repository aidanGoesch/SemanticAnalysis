I gladly accepted her and her child to stay at my home rent free until she is ready to go on. My bestfriend and her husband had a huge falling out. I felt extremely guilty. I allowed her to stay at my house for three weeks now. All she has done for me is take and take from me without ever giving. I figured that she was hurt and not in a good place, so I allowed it. After day in and day out of her not cleaning after herself or her son, not helping around the house, and not being a decent roommate is where I feel like I could have done something. My bestfriend was hurt and I felt obligated to help her. Now I don't know if we will be friends after this whole ordeal. I allowed her to walk all over me because I felt bad, I let her not clean up after herself, and I allowed her to neglect her duty to her son. I feel like I am the one to blame because I took her in and fed her without trying to get her up and going. I gave her too much space. I should've been a better friend, instead I decided to let her do what she wanted. I do not know what to do with her. I want to kick her out, but how bad of a person could I be if I decided to do that. She has a child, nowhere to go, and no friends that will take her in as graciously as I have.",,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGNCZAB
