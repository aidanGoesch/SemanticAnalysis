I offered her my home as a safe place.  However, it instead offered her freedom she hadn't had any opportunity. to have for close to a year prior.   Her priorities shifted from her son being her only priority and reason for her to live, to becoming a social party animal once again while only living in the moment.   I am still unsure what led up to her becoming thrown out of the house by her 'man'.  but i often wonder if she wasn't the one to blame. for his actions.  Not that I would condone those actions, but women can create scenarios in which result in them being able to play a sympathy card. to others.  I recall feeling crushed.  That my helping her, in my point of view hurt her.   She was the 'love of my life' and still is.   I regret not being more direct with her immediately when I noticed issues arising.   Her son was her wo. rld and she loved him more than anything in the world.   I apologize for my vague sentences but I""m trying to fit the requirements as my first attempt i recall, was too long.. and then after I made my comment about not knowing how long tis response should be, it said it was too short so I""m trying to add to the story but without completely rewriting it.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGNCZAB,
