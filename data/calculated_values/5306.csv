It's easy to remember because it's been six months since I finally decided throw caution to the wind and follow my dreams. I always wanted to be my own boss, answering only to myself, and not making a pittance just so someone else can be rewarded for my efforts. As I had planned, I quit my job and used the funds I had slowly saved over the years to buy my first home to spruce up and flip for all that easy money. Well, that was the plan at least. The reality shows, infomercials and seminars all make it out to be so much easier than it actually is. I should have known better, but I was just too excited for the life change I always dreamed of. To be fair, purchasing the first home was easy... too easy. I should have seen the warning flags, but nope, excitement clouded my judgement. The price was great and at first glance the home was in pretty good condition, but that was just a facade. There were so many problems hidden in the walls and beneath the floors; electrical issues, unfinished plumbing, poor insulation, rot in the floorboards. I should have hired an inspector before purchasing, but was worried it would be snapped up by some other conniving entrepreneur. I won't lie and say I took it all in stride; I didn't handle it very well at all first honestly. But, after longer than I'd like to admit, I realized the only path forward was to get to work on the home and try to save myself from this disaster. It's been a hard half year, but it's finally coming together. I had to get another job, take out some loans, and all my spare free time has been spent working on the home myself (at least the parts I didn't need to hire an outside contractor for), but we're finally coming up to the finish line. There's still some aesthetic touch ups left to do, and I'll probably spruce up the yard a bit more, but as soon as the inspector comes by and gives me the a-okay, this house will be going back on the market. Will I end up making a profit? That would be nice, but trying not to be overly optimistic for now. At the very least I know I'll be able to wipe out my newfound debt and recoup at least a good bit of my investment. Will I buy another home after I am free of this short nightmare? I don't know. I haven't given it too much though. I definitely have more experience now and that would help, and I definitely don't want to spend my life as an hourly wage slave, but the magic of the idea has worn off. I guess I'll just see how I feel once I no longer have this burden on my shoulders.",,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPPIVZAT
