This is the first start to my own real estate property company and I am extremely anxious to start, work and take all the lumps included. Now its just a bid so there`s no guarantee that I would get the property. In my head the entirely day waiting for the response from the seller is, ""was my bid high enough"",""did I disrespect them with my bid"" or ""did someone outbid me."" I get a email back from the agent of the seller but I am too nervous to check it. I ask my girlfriend to check it for me and I get a direct answer. They accepted my offer! I finally can begin my dream of having a real estate property company but the hard work has just began. I wait 10 days for the close of the contract to end before I can start on the project. I get the proper permits, put together my own crew of workers to begin and we head into the project right away. I soon find that heading an entire project is not as simple as I thought of and a lot of things are beginning to miss the deadlines of what I set forth. Definitely overwhelmed as I am starting to notice that you have to have reliable people that move the same way you do to be efficient throughout a project as you cannot do all the work yourself. As tough as this task is, I find it so rewarding as I am my own boss and get to make important decisions daily. I am extremely happy about the chance I took and my ability to consistently adapt to my new environment. I eventually finish the project and the house is now listed for resale for me to start a new project right after. I finally did it as I talked about this process for the longest. I even left a secure job that paid me more money to take jobs that I could learn what I needed for this opportunity. Completely rewarding and happy!",,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPPIVZAT
