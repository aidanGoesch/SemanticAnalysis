It was going to be a long trip and I knew I'd be tired by the time I got there, but the chance to see all the different bands playing in one arena was too good to pass up. I decided to leave the day before the festival began. Camping sites were to be provided at the venue, I could get some rest in before the festival started. I was up and on the road by five in the morning, and only stopped for gas or food. I arrived at the camp site early in the evening, and proceeded to set up camp. Proceeded means try, doesn't it? First, while I had brought the tent, the pegs were nowhere to be found. My mind was filled with mages of bears sending my tent rolling downhill with me in it. That sent me to a nearby store in search of tent pegs! Pegs located, I finally got the tent set up. I took the car and went in search of something for dinner and a couple six-packs. I decided on hotdogs and marshallows over the fire for my meal.  Once I actually got a fire started it was an enjoyable evening. As it turned out, though, hotdogs and beer might mix well at a ballgame, but maybe not so much in the middle of a campground! When I woke up the day of the festival, my head was pounding and my stomach felt like it was being squeezed by giant pliers. I managed to drag myself to the car and went in search of breakfast and a couple more sixpacks. After refreshing myself, I packed up the car and headed out for the festival. It was so crowded that when I finally found a place to sit, I could barely see the stage.  The sound though, was awesome! I couldn't believe it when I ran into my next-door neighbor at a concession stand! Bob and his wife were both there, along with a couple of his friends from work. It was nearly time for my favorite band to take the stage so I said goodbye to Bob, and headed back to my seat. The band was fantastic, as expected, and the entire crowd was on its feet for the duration. Happy and exhausted, I left the festival grounds and went back to the motel room I had taken the precaution of rentinf for the night, and was soon sound asleep.",,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPPL3AZI
