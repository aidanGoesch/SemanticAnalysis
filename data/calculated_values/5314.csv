Two were at a community college and the other three a university. After all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this, I finally graduated. They held it at the arena on campus, which was massive. There must have been at least 2,000 people in the crowd and at least 600 graduating with me. I didn't think that I would have many people there for me, most said they couldn't make it. That's why it was so surprising to hear so many people cheering me on when I got my diploma. I wasn't expecting it, but a lot of people showed up for me. It was really heartwarming to see. I couldn't help but smile when I walked across the stage. I figured that I would just grab my diploma and quickly walk on before anyone noticed that there were only a few people there for me. After hearing how many there were, though, I took my time and reveled in it a little. After commencement ended, I took some time to talk to my other classmates and wish them luck. I got to say goodbye to a lot of people I had spent a lot of time with. While this was sad, it was nice to know there would be so many like minded people going out there to further the field of Social Work. Overall, it was a pretty great night.",3SKEMFQBZ4RZDN7C2AMMDQKHDRE8K2,
