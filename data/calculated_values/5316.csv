It was a wedding. The wedding went fine, but one of the people involved has a mishap. They were standing between the bride and groom. But I assume their knees locked. They swayed and rocked quite a bit but they went out. It was funny to many. And they did it more then once. It was several times over, I believe 4 times total. It was funny while at the same time a bit shocking. I had never been to a wedding with such a show before. I felt sorry for them. Some ceremonies can be quite long. Most of the coworkers laughed also. We ended up talking about it later on in the night.",,3SKEMFQBZ4RZDN7C2AMMDQKHJXPK87
