He was worried that I, and his other good friend would do something stupid, or pull a practical joke that might embarrass his soon to be wife during the wedding, so we we’re sternly warned to be on our best behavior. Or else!!The wedding began, we (we were ushers at the wedding) took our places on the stairs leading up to the dais, and stood respectfully watching the ceremony. Perfectly reverent. As we stood there, we casually glanced over at the bridesmaids who were across from us on the steps, and noticed one of them was slightly swaying. We continued to watch as her swaying became more pronounced, and then she proceeded to fall over like a fresh cut tree right between the bride and groom. Out like a light. Total chaos ensued, but we continued to stand stoically as directed. After a brief pause to take in the moment (and share a wink and nod with my counterpart) I stepped up, picked up the still unconscious young lady, and carried her to a side room where she was treated and soon recovered. We returned to the service as the bride and groom were announced as husband and wife and walked together out of the church. Happy ending. They’ve been married 25 years. I almost felt bad for my friend, who was so mistrustful and concerned about my (our) behavior that he felt the need to admonish us. No, that’s not true. I rub his nose in it every time we all get together. it was good memories.",,3SKEMFQBZ4RZDN7C2AMMDQKHJXPK87
