The process went as planned. My husband and director both were there to assist me. I'm so glad to have my new baby boy. The stress of being a new mother is overwhelming at times though. Luckily I do have my husband to help. What an amazing helper he is too. I don't think I could be a new mother without him by my side supporting and helping through it all. Honestly, I imagined this would be a lot easier than it is. I don't think anyone is ever fully prepared though. I have a whole new look on life because of this wonderful little boy. I cannot wait to see what life has in store for us both. There's going to be many ups and downs. I look forward to every moment with him. Thinking of him growing up already has me emotional. Life has definitely gotten a lot more interesting with him around and it's only been 3 months.",,3SKEMFQBZ4RZDN7C2AMMDQKHVKD8K5
