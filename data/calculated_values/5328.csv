It has been there for a while now. It needs to be operate but i am scared because i have not done it before. Even though i was nervous, i still believed it will be successful. The operation was carried out and it was successful. After the operation, i felt a relieve of pain. I was happy and at the same time thankful to God. The inflammation was also gone. After that i have to go for checkup regularly. The doctor gave me several drugs to use and i did use them. He also checked the thoracic anytime i go to the hospital. After that i was not nervous. I have been living freely after then. All thanks to God. That is all about that.",,3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX98MZ1KD
