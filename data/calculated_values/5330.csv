I have herrington rods and pedical screws from my lower neck to my lower back.  Last month I went in to have a few nerve ablations in my right thoracic spine.  I went to a surgery center through Johns Hopkins at their Cumberland location.  I was relieved to find this locations as it was approximately 30 minutes closer than their main location. My husband came with me but needed to wait in the waiting room while I was being prepped and would not be able to see me again until I was in recovery. I was nervous to go back for this minor surgery but was also feeling hopeful that the procedure would help to eliminate my chronic severe muscle spasms and would additionally help to reduce the inflammation in the surrounding area.  When I woke up afterwards I was in less pain than I was expecting.  Once the pain medication wore off I started to feel a little worse but still in the realm of normal.  The first few days were rough pain wise but with rest and medication, I was able to stay on top of it.  Now, here I am a few weeks out and completely spasm free!  I will need to repeat the process in about a year when the nerves regenerate.  It's frustrating to have chronic pain but it's nice to know that there are some non medication related therapies. My goal is to continue physical therapy and heal my spine as much as possible over this next year so that I won't need to have the procedure as often as is recommended. Overall, I'm very happy with the procedure and my recovery so far.",3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX98MZ1KD,3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX98MZ1KD
