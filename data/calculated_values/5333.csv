So nearly four months myself and my mother decided to sale our house and move to other location. I searched in online for buying a new house in my preferred area. We even approached many real estate agents to find a good home. In between we sold our old home and deposited the amount in the bank. We moved to a rented house for a temporary time. We searched for many houses but we didn't find any proper house. I even asked my friends and family to inform me about any house selling. Suddenly I got a call from my friend. She said that she found a house ready to sale in her locality. I liked the house from outside. Immediately I went to the house and looked for the facilities and any damages so that I can ask for right price. Everything was fine with some small damages here and there. I decided to buy the house and talked about the price. But at that time they asked a high price for the house. Then two months ago they came to my house with some price negotiation. Though the price was somewhat high, I accepted to the price and the deal was concluded.",,3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YVN5FBZP
