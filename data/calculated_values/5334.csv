I was accepted to my number one school Notre Dame. It is the school I grew up rooting for. I have so many memories as a kid going to football games and watching the fighting Irish win. I was very shocked to have been accepted first among transfer students. I wrote a personal statement essay that came from my heart. It really was genuine essay that I spent a lot of time on.  I will never forget the day I was accepted. Me and my mom cried tears of joy as we new someday we could both be recognized as Irish alum. I am extremely excited. I will be going to the school next year. I will set out on my next goal to hopefully become a doctor. Both of my parents were doctors. I want to follow in their footsteps. Notre dame will always be a special place to me.,,3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YVN5FBZP
