Listen to my story it is beautiful. Her and I were walking along the beach on a nice romantic summer night. All you could hear while walking was the sound of the waves crashing on the shore. I stop and tell her to look at the bright full moon and say, ""isn't it beautiful?"". She shyly agrees and I sneak in a kiss. She kissed me back and knew it was time. I put my knee in the sand, and reach into my pocket to pull out the ring. I open the box and look her into her eyes and say, ""I love you and will you spend the rest of your life with me?"". She very happily said, ""Oh yes, yes I will"". We kissed with a great passion. I put a ring on her finger. She then started to cry. She then text all her friends and family. All in all I'd say we had a beautiful evening.",,3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YVWGTZBM
