We had been dating for about 2 years. We are very happy together. We discussed marriage all the time. It was a no-brainer to ask her to marry me. I did not ask her father for permission first. That is too old school for us. I took her for a walk and proposed at ""our spot"". It was very simple, but it was us. She told me she knew she loved me years ago when I wanted to go for a walk with her. She cried. I cried. They were tears of happiness. The most memorable thing was how simple and right it all felt. We already know that we don't want to have a big wedding. It costs too much money. We would rather spend it on living and traveling. We do want to have a reception.",3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YVWGTZBM,3SLE99ER0OZD4G455N96R7YVWGTZBM
