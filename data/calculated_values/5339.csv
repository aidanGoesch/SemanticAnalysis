People like to consider themselves generous and kind and caring, like they actually have consideration for those in and around them ... but in reality they don't.  Who people actually care about is themselves.  My old acquaintance didn't actually have any real interest in reconnecting with me.  When I responded to the contact, what I found was he was looking for some ""research"" on me.  And not even me in particular.  Just the kind of person I am, based on the kind of person he remembered me being.  His boss needed some ""details"" and ""personal stories"" on certain kinds of people, and I was just a checkbox on his list.  He reached out thinking I could be a checked off box for him, and did so by dangling the bait of some small amount of Hollywood access and sightseeing.  The contact was all about him, not me, and I only wish I'd learned that people will only ever favor themselves before I let the possibility of a reconciliation put me in a position to have an old wound ripped open.  It could have been significantly less painful if I'd just ignored him.  Or remembered how things had ended in the first place.  When you let yourself believe you should put others ahead of yourself, you're just setting yourself up to be pummeled.  I managed to figure out the game in time to avoid getting drawn in too deep.  But not in time to avoid having old wounds clawed open afresh.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL5Y8LUX,
