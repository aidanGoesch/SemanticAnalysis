He's now living in California, and found me through social media. Which is pretty funny considering I have next to no social media presence, but there you go regardless.  Pete invited me out to Los Angeles, to catch up and get reacquainted.  He's a mid-level manager with a props company that works with studios and producers, and he remembered I love movies.  I love them more now.  I was surprised to find I enjoyed the conversation.  I was even more surprised by the invitation.  He'll put me up out there, room and board for the most part, for a whole month if I want.  All I have to do is pay for my travel.  It's a very tempting offer.  I haven't traveled much, even though I've wanted to.  And I do remember having some good times with Pete back in school.  I'm still thinking the offer over, and told him that much.  But I think, after I dither some more for a few days or maybe a week, I'll accept.  After all, I do love movies and Hollywood.  And Pete and I need to make up, after the falling out we experienced.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL5Y8LUX,3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL5Y8LUX
