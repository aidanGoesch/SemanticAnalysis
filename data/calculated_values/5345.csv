The bike is a used Schwinn. It's an older model, but in really good shape. I have been used to riding hard tail mountain bikes.  I had heard of and seen full suspension mountain bikes, but the prices were out of my reach. Also, I wasn't expecting much of an improvement. I saw full suspension bikes as a kind of gimmick. I figured the bike would not ride as well. I figured the suspension would not have much of an effect. Well, I was wrong. I fell in love with the bike within 5 minutes of riding it. It wasn't long before I discovered that I could ride it for longer. It was less ""hard"" on me than a traditional bike. You still feel the impacts, but a lot of the force is taken out of them. That makes the ride much more comfortable. It has actually rekindled my interest in cycling to a degree.",,3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL6V6ULZ
