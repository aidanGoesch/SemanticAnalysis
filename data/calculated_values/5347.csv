I'm very pleased to say that it was a good experience. I also want to say that showing up in person can really improve a relationship. Things were getting so weird on the phone with my family that I was half expecting them to be really unhappy to see me when I arrived. I had such misgivings about the trip that I didn't even bother calling them to say that I'd be visiting. And so I was really surprised by how happy they were to see me when we actually met. The way it happened: I drove into town and surprised them just as they happened to be walking out the front door.  I was immediately greeted with happy faces and a big, long hug from my aunt.  Even my mom was glad to see me. I was particularly worried about how she would take my visit. But she was very glad to see me. - Don't get me wrong. - Things were still kind of weird between us. And things remain weird in our family. I've spoken with them on the phone since my return, and I have to say - I don't pretend to understand them very well. But for all I know, showing up in person was something that sort of saved our relationship.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL8HUULX,
