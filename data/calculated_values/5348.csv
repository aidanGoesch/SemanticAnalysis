My mom looks like she's recovering but will never have her old life back. Her short-term memory is obviously not too good anymore. Before the trip, I wasn't even planning to visit so soon. Plus I didn't really want to see them. They'd been giving me the impression that I wasn't exactly welcome anymore. But I wanted to be a good son, and I sorely needed a vacation anyway. When I left, I was feeling so bothered, so pressure, so paranoid that I didn't even tell them I was coming. My attitude about them was, ""well, here's you son - like it or lump it. Let me do my filial duty and get out of here."" When I saw them in person, everything was different. There was welcome surprise, big hugs, and really just gratitude for me showing up in the flesh. Plus, my mood was positive and peaceful, pretty much from start to finish. It really was a pleasure. It was such a good and unexpected experience that I plan on visiting again before too long. I don't know how things will be next time, but my goodness, that is my mother. As a son, you're supposed to visit your sick parents.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL8HUULX,3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL8HUULX
