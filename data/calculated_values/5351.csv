I was bored one Friday evening and i just went on an online dating website. I met this girl and we just connected right from the start. We had the same hobbies. We even liked the same type of food. Everything was going great. I decided that i really wanted to meet her in person. Just like that , i booked a ticket to New Jersey to see and meet her. She was exactly what i imagined. She was beautiful and smart. She was also very witty and friendly as well. After about 2 months of chatting, we were official. She decided she wanted to move to my state and live with me. Everything is going great. I'm so happy that i was able to meet her. She is my everything.",,3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG015VCKG
