He was seriously injured from the accident and had actually died and needed to resuscitated on his way to the hospital. I thought I would lose him. He had broken his C7 vertebrae, crushed his larynx, pharynx and paralyzed his vocal cords. During his stint at the hospital he was handling it well. He wasn't very happy about it but he was pushing through and just continued to be himself. Every day his voice is getting a little bit stronger and he is scheduled to get the tracheotomy taken out soon. This will relieve the family of a lot of the everyday nursing duties that we've shared. It will be a bit of a recovery time for him but the doctors think he is ready and he is beating all standards so far so we are not going to be ones to disagree with him. Right after he had a consultation he wanted to go to the motorcycle dealership to look at new bikes. He already has his eyes set on a new a one. I told him that when he was ready to buy a new one I would buy one with him too. Granted he will probably buy a much nicer bike than I will but is nice to be able to still share that with him. He won't be able to ride for a bit but we are both hopeful. It is very satisfying to see that even a huge accident wouldn't deter him from his love of motorcycles. He has been riding forever and we were all worried if he would become scared of them. I don't think any of us expected him to want to get back on so soon but he just loves them so much. I'm just glad he is progressing steadily and can keep looking to the future.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0BF7KCU,
