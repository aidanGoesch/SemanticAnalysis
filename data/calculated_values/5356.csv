He was riding his motorcycle on his way to his house when a box truck stopped harshly in front of him. He was checking his mirrors and when he looked back up he did not have enough time to slow down all the way. He hit the brakes as hard as he could and ended up hitting the back of the truck. His motorcycle went under the truck and his neck was the first point of contact with the truck's bumper. He broke his c7 vertebrae, and destroyed his larynx pharynx and most of everything in his neck. I was riding behind him and was able to stop in time. I am not trained in CPR or any type of emergency medical care so I just dumped my bike and got on the phone with 911. The truck behind us attempted to stop traffic from coming towards us. He was helevacced to the nearest hospital. En route to the hospital he died twice and was resuscitated. I picked my bike back up and essentially followed the helicopter to where the hospital was. When I got there things were not looking good and I worried my dad would be severely brain damaged or even dead. They eventually were able to stabilize him and put him in a medically induced coma. He was in the coma for 7 days and when he awoke there was no sign of brain damage. He made an incredible recovery over 18 days and was released from the hospital then. While he is still limited with the neck brace and some other injuries that happened he is already looking at new motorcycles to buy.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0BF7KCU,3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0BF7KCU
