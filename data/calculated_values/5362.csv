My roommates Pete, Jim and Bob (who we all call Lude) had gone with me to a party at my friend Lisa's house. At the party, we met up with Ann and Chris, two girls who hang out with us a lot. Ann and I used to be romantically involved a few months ago, but we're just friends now. Chris and Pete have had an on-again, off-again relationship. When we got back to the house, my roommate John, who had not attended the party with the rest of us, was there drinking beer with several of his friends that I didn't really know. One of John's friends seemed to take a liking to Chris and was chatting her up outside on the patio.  She seemed interested in him. Pete noticed the interaction and started drinking a lot of bourbon, perhaps because he had hoped to have sex with Chris that night and saw that he had competition. As the night wore on, we all had become pretty drunk, especially Pete. The first guy who had been hitting on Chris ended up leaving with her. Pete had been distracted with something else and didn't notice until they had been gone for several minutes. When he figured out that Chris had left with another guy, Pete went kinda crazy. He started blaming our roommate John for bringing those strange guys to the house. Pete started yelling right in John's face, and John got very agitated. A fight between Pete and John seemed likely to break out, but a second and third guy that we didn't really know, walked up and settled the situation down by separating Pete and John. However, a fourth guy was disappointed that Pete and John had decided not to fight. He tried to agitate them into fighting by saying some really insulting obnoxious things about Chris and Ann, but a fifth and sixth guy came in a tried to shut up the fourth guy. The fourth guy and the sixth guy, who seemed to known each other fairly well, took exception to each other, and the sixth guy got really angry. The sixth guy really lost his cool and started throwing stuff around the patio area. It looked like they would come to blows, but they managed to avoid each other for the rest of the night. By then, my roommates and I had decided to call it a night, so we sent everybody on their merry ways. I think everybody needed to sleep it off.",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86XNXJYQ
