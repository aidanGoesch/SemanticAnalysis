During this time, an early retirement offer was made to a large group of people at my workplace. after retiring, I was offered a very high paying supervisor position at the same place of employment that I turned down. Although my health problems were no longer a consideration, I had two primary motivations for refusing the offer.  I was and am enjoying retirement immensely. But the main reason I refused the offer, was I have never had any desire to be the boss. Not everyone has the temperament or desire to be a Supervisor. After 40 years of being a blue collar worker in a large mill, I had more hands on experience across the process than anyone there or most likely in the industry.  Hands on experience is valuable in troubleshooting and there is little doubt in my mind that I could be of help. But, confrontations, being ""bossy"" , being responsible for decisions made by others is just something I never had the desire to do.  The skill set required to be a good mill hand, does not necessarily translate to the skill set require to be a high level supervisor. I was flattered, and quite surprised at the offer. I knew my supervisors had always been happy with my work and work ethic. However, I didn't know they liked me well enough to make me this sort of offer. I was a union official for 11 years and not well liked by the company officials at the time, which was many years before this event.",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86YRYYJF
