It's only been three weeks, but I am screaming inside. How am I going to pay my bills, which are already piling up. I was already struggling as it is when I had a steady income. I'm sending out resumes and filling out applications like a crazy person, but I'm not getting any leads or bites. I laughed to myself (derisively of course) about how it's too bad I'm not anybody famous or important's cousin or niece. I'd probably find a job easy if that were the case! Being unemployed with no prospects is the worst feeling in the world. I am sitting home so completely useless to my family. They're trying to be supportive, but I can see they're as scared as I am about this jobless situation. The little cash I had saved will be used to keep a roof over our heads. Once that's gone, that's it. I had chest pains so bad the other day, I thought I was having a heart attack. I know it was only anxiety though, but that was pretty terrifying. I don't have the money for doctors, so I took a break from applying for new jobs to try and relax. It didn't work, but it was good to get off the grind for a few minutes. I hope things will work out for the better, but I'm losing faith.",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86ZEMJYZ
