I was very surprised by this due to the fact that i was highly regarded within the company and my position was important to the continued growth of the company. The lay off has caused a great deal of anxiety for myself and my wife due to our financial situation. Our greatest challenge is paying for our continued health care coverage through the COBRA plan. The event has caused me to question many things about my self including my self worth and my abilities as a manager. I have been dealing with depression, sleeplessness and fear for my future. I work in an industry that does most of its hiring in late winter or early spring so getting laid off this time of year makes it particularly difficult to find work. In this job i led two distinct teams and held two management titles. Now I have a great deal of anxiety about applying for any job that requires me to manage other people even though i have been successful doing so in the past. I am also considering leaving this industry due to the uncertainty that comes with sometimes seasonal employment. Plants are my passion however, at 51 years old i crave stability and a less demanding career. I am trying to scrape together any income that i can while I search for work. We are selling everything we can think of that we no longer use in order to reduce our anxiety. I am even selling my guitars. I must add that the current political climate & our president's trade war have added to my concerns about our finances and my retirement nest egg. It is difficult to stay optimistic with so many negatives in my life right now. Time will tell how this all turns out!",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86ZEMJYZ
