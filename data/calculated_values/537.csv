My dad died when I was two years old and my mum remarried and my wonderful step father molested me right from the ages of thirteen. This went on for 10 years and i was emotionally frustrated but I thank God for allowing encounter Christ Jesus via the Catholic Church where my heart and its thoughts were renewed. God used Mr Smalling to  approach me one Sunday evening this year May while I was at the park. He asked if he could join me on the bench and i allowed. He was listening to a message on his phone aloud and i was able to listen to the message audibly. I asked him aome questions in respect of the messages. He answered me. I then had a long conversation and we became close friend. he invited me for some church services. I did. I joined some groups in the church. I got born again. I was baptized and started living a righteous life. God helped me go through the healing process. I am healed emotional,,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKJW1HA6
