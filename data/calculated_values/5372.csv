I was involved in a freak car accident that happened after I had just dropped off my brother at the gym. I was driving straight and heading towards target. I had the light and was listening to my favorite music, I was so focused on what I was going to get at target that I guess I wasn't as aware of my surroundings. I was driving and crossing the intersection, as a car ran the red light from my left side and sent me into a spin. They made contact on the rear of my car, causing me to not know where I was heading and leaving me unable to control the car. I was lucky enough that the car tried to stop and swerved so much that I was hit with the side of the other car instead of the front of the other car. This was very striking as it was something that nobody expects, especially since I was just heading to the store. This left me in awe as my car came to a stop a little past the middle of the intersection. I was thankfully left unhurt and as soon as I was able to come to come to my senses I stepped out of my car. The other driver was also unhurt besides slight soreness and jitters. The driver made sure I was ok and called the cops to the scene, luckily there were witnesses at the scene to give a different perspective. I then called my spouses and parents to let them know what happened as I was the one who was running errands. The whole situation showed me that unexpected things could happen suddenly and change how you continue your day or change it overall. Luckily my car was not totaled and just needed some work on the rear side to assure that it was drive able. Overall, from this day I became very thankful for the things that I take for granted and make sure that I am always paying attention to my surroundings. I now am very cautious when driving and more so since I would not want to get into another accident.",,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG49ZMTK7
