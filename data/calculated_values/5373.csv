There was a pretty girl having a drink close to us. The finest girl in the bar. I thought she was a little out of my league. However, my buddy nudged me on. I spoke with her. We had a great conversation for the rest of the night. We both relaxed with each other and had a few drinks. I ended up leaving the bar with her phone number. We also agreed to meet again. It went really well. As a result, I think I should have more faith in my self confidence. The encounter made that more apparent. Also, my buddy is a great wing man. Props to him.",,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4QQXTKH
