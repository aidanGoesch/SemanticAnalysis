My child died. This was incredibly painful for me. I was depressed for a few weeks. My wife almost killed herself over this. I stopped her and said the kid wouldn't want this to happen. I had a ton of drinks to distract myself from the pain. I puked a bunch of times. I remember the good times with the kid. I remember going to the park to play ball. I threw the ball back and forth for an hour on every Saturday. He got so good, he was a star pitcher for the school's baseball team. They won a championship. I hope he is doing well in heaven. He had a good life.",,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4XKVKT1
