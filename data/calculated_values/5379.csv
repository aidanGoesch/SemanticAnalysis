It all started 16 weeks back when we finally got the good news that we were going to have children. We were both so excited and couldn't wait to start looking into getting the room ready. When we heard that we were actually about to have twins, I just couldn't believe it! We were so happy! On the way home we just talked and talked about names and room designs. We let all our families know and talked in great detail about everything we had planned to do. But now I feel like everything is falling apart. Our marriage seems to be struggling and just going the through the day is harder than it has ever been. We haven't been fighting but we are surely slowly drifting apart, I don't think either of us has any blame for the other but still there is a void forming. Every day I wonder if things will get better. We try to communicate through small talk but it falls short every time. Neither of use really have interest in watching our shows. We no longer are wanted to get out into the world and experience things. I don't know how we will ever recover but I really hope we do. I really hope we can recover from this but it is very hard. I don't even know how to begin telling our families. Hopefully we can get the strength to over come this. Maybe we will try again once we heal. But as it stands now I don't see that coming anytime soon.",,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4YEFKTA
