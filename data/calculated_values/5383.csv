It was a very emotional visit for me because my son is a young adult who has been through a lot, and I have suffered a lot of emotional distress over situations with him in the past. I spent a lot of time advising him and helping him overcome difficulties, so it meant a lot for him to be accepted in the Army. The most memorable thing was seeing my son get off the plane wearing his military uniform; I will never forget that, because of the pride I felt in that moment. The event was a reunion with my son in the military. I also have a strong memory of the time we spent when he visited home for the first time. We talked a lot about his experiences in basic training, and of the times when he was sure he would not make it through. We talked and laughed about the many different characters he has met, some of them friends and some of them foes. We talked about his experiences undergoing gas mask training and obstacle courses. I asked about his basic training roommate, who was doing so well until the end, when he quit instead of facing a consequence for getting in trouble. It was memorable because I missed my son's graduation from basic training, too. I got to spend a lot of quality time with my son, doing things like baking together and playing scrabble. I was happy that my son got to talk with his step dad, because their relationship has been strained. I shed some happy tears during this visit. I also  enjoyed looking over photos that my son took during his time in the army so far.",3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLM2OE63,3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLM2OE63
