She was 30, going about her life with the excitement and optimism of someone with endless possibilities. A move to London with her fairly new (but besotted) boyfriend was a few months ahead. All the usual feelings were present: nerves about leaving behind her family, excitement to meet up with old mates, wonder about what would happen on the job front, and whether she and the bloke would cement their relationship. we get together every year for a memorials. All it took to end those possibilities was one misstep. One Sunday night I received a call from my brother's wife. Our sister's boyfriend was at her door, wondering if anyone knew where she was. It had been almost 20 hours since he'd heard from her, which was unusual. Looking back over my phone, I'd texted her the previous night seeing if she wanted to join us for a drink, but hadn't heard from her since about 5pm. Racing through our contacts, no-one had heard from her for some time. She had been out for drinks with an old friend, so naturally I got in touch, to hear she'd put my sister in a cab around 10pm and sent her home â€” ""drunk, but nothing too serious."" At this point, we still weren't overly worried, but thought we best head to her apartment to see if we could find her, or at least be with her partner. Her apartment was locked, and her partner didn't have a key. The decision was made to break into her place to double-check before looking elsewhere. We'd called the hospitals and police with no luck. We called a locksmith, who jemmied the door. We entered. I noticed the bathroom light on so went in that direction, before hearing, ""She's here, she's dead."" It's a time t o reflect and remember the good times with her.",,3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLU996E2
