There was little warning and no outward signs that definitively pointed to any form of dementia at all. Oh, there was the occasional forgetfulness and a few times the month before her diagnosis where she called me one day to tell me something and then called again three days later to tell me the same thing again. But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer. We've all learned several hard lessons around this development. Alzheimer's now runs in the family and all 4 of us kids now have an increased chance of being diagnosed with it. I'm 64 and I have to think about the burden that puts on my kids and my wife. 5 months ago? It didn't even register on my list of possibilities but Alzheimer's just changed my life and I don't even have it. Yet.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKKXWHA4
