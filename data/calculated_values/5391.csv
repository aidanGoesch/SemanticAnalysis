I AM HONORED THAT SHE WANTS ME IN THE ROOM WITH HER.  MY SISTER IS 42 YEARS OLD AND SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD BEEN TRYING TO HAVE A BABY FOR SEVERAL YEARS WITH NO LUCK.  THEY WERE FINALLY ABLE TO AFFORD THE IN VITRO FERTILIZATION PROCEDURE.  THE PROCEDURE WAS SUCCESSFUL AND WE WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THIS DAY TO COME.  I GOT TO EXPERIENCE EVERY MOMENT WITH HER.  THE BIRTH WAS SCHEDULED SO I WENT WITH HER AND HER HUSBAND TO THE HOSPITAL.  MY SISTER WAS AWESOME!  THE WHOLE LABOR WAS NICE AND RELAXED AND EASY FOR HER.  I WAS BY HER SIDE WHEN SHE PUSHED AND HELPED HER THROUGH THE BREATHING AND PUSHING PHASE.  WHEN MY SWEET NIECE ARRIVED, WE WERE ALL CRYING.  SHE WAS PERFECT.  MOMMY AND BABY WERE BOTH HEALTHY.  I WILL NEVER FORGET THIS.  IT WAS A MEMORY THAT I WILL CHERISH JUST LIKE THE BIRTH OF MY OWN CHILDREN.",3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLWY3E6K,
