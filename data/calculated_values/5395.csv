I love living on my little farm, but things have gotten too much for me to keep up with. I guess I am blessed to have the friends and family I have. Three months ago I was telling my son that I just couldn't manage the farm and keep up with all the projects that needed to be done. The next day a whole gang of friends and family showed up. They built the prefab carport and greenhouse that I had ordered a year ago and had just been laying there in boxes and on top of that they prepped my garden for the next round of planting. I know now I can count on those close to me for help when I really need it and I don't need to give up my farm and life to this horrible illness. I really see God's hand in this. It makes me love my family and friends even more. On some level because I was sick I didn't think I deserved to be able to stay here. I know I can ask for help now. It will for sure make things easier on me. I won't kill myself by staying. I won't kill myself by leaving. I couldn't ask for a better outcome.",,3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY161QH9RN
