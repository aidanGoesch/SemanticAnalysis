They had me doing my original job, plus a second job, for the salary of just one job.  The second job represented the next step toward my career goals and a realization of a lot of the time and resources I've put toward advancing my career.  However, the salary was not commensurate with the amount of work I was doing, I was putting in nearly 90 hours a week, and the situation was incredibly stressful.  It started to take a toll on my physical and emotional health and strained my relationships with family, friends, and coworkers.  The dual-role situation was expected to last one year, at which point my second job would be split off into its own role, which I would fill.  However, an the organization faced some unexpected financial hardship, which meant they had to reduce positions, rather than create new one.  This meant they asked me to continue in the dual role for another year, promising to split the roles in another year's time, when finances were better.  After a long and careful consideration, I determined to decline and take a position with another organization which would be a lateral move.  I applied for and was offered the new job, which I accepted.  After already initiating the onboard process with the new organization, my old organization called and begged me to come back.  They offered a slightly different arrangement of my role.  However, it would still require significant time (and likely stress) for the same amount of pay and no guarantee of the company's future stability.  It put me back in the throes of decision making.  Ultimately, I turned them down again but I did have some feelings of melancholy.  Fortunately, the latest update of this story takes a turn for the happy.  I have been recruited by a third organization to fulfill a newly created role in my desired field.  I've had a hand in defining the role, bargaining for my pay, and shaping the next steps of my career.  This divine turn of events shows that sometimes, in order to make progress, we first have to take a step back.",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B9XBHWM,
