First I got fired for working too hard.  I kept coming in to get extra work done, but my boss didn't want to have to pay me overtime.  I actually got fired for working too much.  It's unbelievable. Then I felt so bad I thought I might hurt myself or kill myself.  My parents realized that something was off and took me to the hospital where they realized I was suicidal.  Now that I've been released, I'm moving back in with mom and dad.  I can't believe that I'm living with my parents again at the age of 40.  I feel like a failure.  At least mom and dad still love me and were willing to take me in. I feel bad but I'm hoping to get back on my feet.  If I can beat this depression, I want to go back to school and get training to be a nurse.  That's a job that does pay overtime and can accommodate my hard work.  Maybe they will appreciate me.",,3T3IWE1XG794MAXVIDHE08SD86JQT3
