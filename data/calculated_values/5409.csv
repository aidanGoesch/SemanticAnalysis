My fiance was gone.  It honestly didn't feel real.  Waking up in the mornings hasn't gotten hard.  In fact I think its the hardest part.  As I wake up you think your dream mind tends to feel like they are still there.  The same old routine.  But then you lean over and they aren't there anymore.  And all these pains keep flooding back to me.  It's easier to deal with at work, but when home alone again it is just way too difficult.  I need people around me or I just sink into my own thoughts.  My family and friends keep trying to reach out and comfort me, but I just tell them I'm doing okay and I think they buy the lie.  Too be honest I'm broken and have no outlook for my future since this wasn't what it was supposed to be.  What do I do with my life.  I don't even know.",,3T3IWE1XG794MAXVIDHE08SDOJ2QTS
