I went to see my family doctor and he told me that my condition as a diabetic has worsened. I felt confused because I've been doing my best to live a healthier life style. He said because of my past eating mistakes that my condition is worse and my medication would be changed to a higher dosage. I'm frantic about this. How do I get the energy I need to keep my job and family secure? I'm having trouble remembering things that I read . I'm having to write more things down. This is depressing me, I want my life back. I will figure this out, it will not beat me. I put on my face every morning that tell the world I'm doing great. If only everyone knew that its a lie. Or that I cry myself to sleep at night because I'm afraid. I see my sister in my dreams being taken from us because of diabetes. What if it takes me to, what will happen to my children? Writing this down everyday helps me cope with my fears. I hope I find the strength to conquer them. My father taught me to never give up. I wish he was still with us. I need him right now. But I will be okay, I will fight harder to be well again. I love my children to much not to give it my all.",339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVHH0KIS,
