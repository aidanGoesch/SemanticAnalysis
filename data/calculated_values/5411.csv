A is a retired (got shot in the line of duty) police officer, and so as soon as it happened I thundered down the stairs, rang his doorbell incessantly, over and over, while on the phone with the police. He had been outside smoking and so when he came back in, he said he saw me pacing the stairs like a cornered animal, sobbing uncontrollably. Apparently (I have no memory of this) I just sort of screamed, ""A, he's dead."" The rest of this is a blur of police officers, the coroner, detectives, lots of flashing lights and crying and phone calls. I don't remember that blur. What I remember is the downstairs neighbors across the hall from A's apartment holding me in their arms and praying over me, their voices a tide of soothing murmurs. I remember A pullling aside an officer - he knew all of them - and telling them that I was family, and they needed to treat me as such. I remember standing beside the investigator's unmarked vehicle as one of the officers pulled me into his embrace and towed that line between business and casual, still ""ma'am""ing me but being as helpful as he could. I remember the kindness and gentle demeanor everyone treated me with that night. If he knew how many people were upset, if he had ANY idea how many people were so devastated, he'd have never left us. I spent this weekend, four months ago, holding his family close to me, sharing memories and laughter and General Tso's chicken with his father and mother, his grandmother. I see him mirrored in their actions - his father's reflexive ""rubbing the back of his head in times of stress"" motion, his mother's love of animals and her silly, non-PC sense of humor. He has his mother's nose and mouth, his father's kind, loving eyes, and his grandmother's generous heart. I held his grandmother while she cried and asked me if her grandson loved her, because she'd been told he did, but she just wasn't sure. I spent two nights and three days with these people, my future in-laws, and hugged the dog I loved very much goodbye. His father handed me a worn-out leather Bible, told me it had been his first after he'd been saved, and he wanted it to stay in the family. He pressed it into my hands and I rubbed the cover like a talisman as I went back inside the apartment building, too sad to see them leave.",3T3IWE1XG794MAXVIDHE08SDOJ2QTS,3T3IWE1XG794MAXVIDHE08SDOJ2QTS
