The cat looked so sad when I gazed upon it.  It looked at me with so much sorrow in its eyes.  I went to pick the cat up to comfort its pain.  It has been a few weeks past since I took the cat into my house.  I am so happy to see the cag is safe now.  The cat is happy as well.  It eyes are full of joy when I play with it daily.  When I get home from work the cat all ways greet me at the door.  I am glad the cat came into my life.  A year has passed and the cat and I are still happy together.  The cat still greet me at the door.  Some days I can not wait to get home.  I am excited to see the cat like it is the first time.  Wea re so happy with each other.,,3T3IWE1XG794MAXVIDHE08SDY8ITQZ
