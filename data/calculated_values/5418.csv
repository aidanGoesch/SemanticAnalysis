I was shipped out to New York to get training on one of their new operating systems. This trip was nothing like the ones I am used to. New York was very busy. Not only traffic but commuters, mostly in suits. I was excited to visit New York to see the city. The most memorable part of my visit was seeing Times Square. If I'm being honest, the statue of liberty was surprising. I had no idea it was that beautiful. It was one of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. But back to the training. It was a really cool experience. This new operating system is like nothing I've ever seen. The projection value of this operating system could change my life. Using the new capabilities of this system, the company I work for can make millions if not billions and you know what that means for me. I might become a millionaire. The experience that I was given, visiting New York and testing this new system is one that I'll never forget. Great things are ahead for me. Hopefully.",,3TAYZSBPLMUMFRIVR2MNULYOGIYS21
