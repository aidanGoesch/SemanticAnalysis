I would for sure go back someday with my kids and kind of show them some of the places that I visited. in my spare time when I wasn't working like Wrigley stadium and some of the museums. and even the city which is actually pretty clean as far as city's tend to go at least compared to the city I live in.   This is something I would probably never do again but it would be fun to maybe visit someday.   Ohio was ok it was kind of boring in comparison though to Chicago and I probably wont visit.  They did however have some nice people and good places to just get a beer and that is always a good thing.",,3TAYZSBPLMUMFRIVR2MNULYOGIYS21
