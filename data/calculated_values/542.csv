Type 2 and It scared me because my sister died from diabete . Everything in my life has changed since that day. I feel different, not like myself. I'm more cautious about everything , not just my health. I wanted to have another child one day, but now I don't think I should. What if something happens to me and my children are without a mother?  I'm scared and confident at the same time that I will fight this and get better. I have to , my children need their mom. I refuse to let this disease take over my life. It took my sister , but it wont take me. I cried about this the first few nights. My daughter asked me whats wrong mom? I told her I was ill but I am going to be fine. she comforted me and I knew I am going to be fine. I love my children and I love my life with them.",339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVHH0KIS,339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVHH0KIS
