I will remember the good times I had with the good boy. I remember going to the park to play ball. I threw the ball a lot and she always got the ball back to me. I accidentally hit somebody in the shin. I had to run away from getting into a fight with the person. The dog got the ball back. That was funny. I also remember she loved eating peanut butter on her dog food. I gave her this treat once a week. She would always be smacking her lips after eating the peanut butter. It was a funny sight to see. I hope she is doing well in dog heaven. I hope I can see her again one day. She will always be a good dog.",,3TDXMTX3CCGL3EY09S4CGW9DL8W6I2
