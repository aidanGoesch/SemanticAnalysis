It was not unexpected as she had been ill and slightly suffering for some time.  She had an auto immune disorder called Pemphigus.  She was taking some medications for this that really helped her, but were also super strong and hard on her body.  One night, she seemed to be in pain and we rushed her to an emergency vet.  They informed us that she wouldn't make it through the night.  They said she would have to be put down.  My family and I were put into a private room so that we could be with her and say our goodbyes.  Before bringing Bella in, they gave her some sort of sedative.  While placed on a bed in the room, I gave her lots of kisses and kept telling her how much I loved her.  After about 10 minutes she passed away on her own.  I still miss her every single day.  The love of a dog is hard to explain if you've never experienced it.  Dogs are basically people to me, in fact I actually put them above other humans.  They are like angels that God placed on Earth for people to experience.  Losing Bella was extremely difficult but I wouldn't change it for anything.  I was with her when she passed and it was a special moment, even though it was hard.  I will never forget her as long as I live.",3TDXMTX3CCGL3EY09S4CGW9DL8W6I2,3TDXMTX3CCGL3EY09S4CGW9DL8W6I2
