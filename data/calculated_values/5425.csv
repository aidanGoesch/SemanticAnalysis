I had to make my way to downtown Manhattan. I took a seat on the crowded subway and didn't have to stand. As I sat down I noticed this beautiful lady looking for a seat. I had an open seat next to me. I caught her eye and gave her a friendly glare. She noticed the seat was empty next to me. I put my book down on the seat,so no one took the seat. She made her way over, and quickly sat down. She smelled on Jasmine and sandalwood. A scent that was feminine and light. We exchanged greetings, and I told her my name. She told me her name, and it was as beautiful as her. We talked as if we knew each other forever. Before we parted ways I was shocked she leaned over and kissed me on the cheek.",,3TDXMTX3CCGL3EY09S4CGW9DL9AI6U
