I got called for an interview in a city that was about 5 hours drive from where i stay. I decided to embark on this journey that faithful day of the interview. On getting to the location was not too easy for i was running late for the interview.  Getting there i finished and headed back to my place. I am having issues in my relationship, my girlfriend is not making me happy and she is taking me for granted in which i have been sober for almost 3 months no. I boarded a bus back lucky for me a young pretty lady sat next to me i was a bit happy because she was my type of girl. she later changed sit. with i was not really happy about, i never wanted to loose on both ends because i did not get the job. i wanted someone to talk to and make me happy. She was sitting behind me, she tapped me on my shoulder and asked if i could lend her my pen, there and then i knew she noticed me then i initiated a conversation and asked her to come sit beside me, to my surprise she did. we talked all through the journey, for those hours i forgot about my worries, i was happy. she is nice and friendly. Her gaze, her smile her voice is everything i can think about right now.",,3TDXMTX3CCGL3EY09S4CGW9DL9AI6U
