I graduated Mechanical Engineering and enjoyed Math. I actually got A's in all my Math subjects in high school and college. I worked as a Marketing executive for an oil company and retired after 26 years. When I retire, I wanted to help students using my Math skills. I was a substitute Math teacher in high schools around my area. I organized a tutoring group which gave free tutoring to members of our church.  The reason for my love of Math is because of a very effective Math teacher when I was in high school.  She made Math very interesting and challenging. I cannot keep tract of how many students I have helped. One recent tutoring experience stands out in my memory. A few months ago,  an 11th  grade student's  mom advertised on line for a Math Tutor  because her son was failing terribly his Algebra 2 class.  The mom's name was Jenny and the student, Neal. There were only less that 3 months before school ended. I offered to help him and started assessing his weakness in Algebra 2.  Then I met with him every week to help him with his homework and test review packets. He started to improve over the weeks. Then, he started making better grades in his tests. One day, he aced a test and his mom was was happy that she sent me a note with an check including a bonus amount! On top of that she said the she wished she had met me  when Neal was back in 7th grade! I was so thrilled and thanked the Lord for using me to help Neal. At the end of the school, we were all so happy when Neal ended up with a B+ average (versus F when I started helping him!).",3TE3O85731UAECIICDMI4BTSVI3R25,
