She left about 12 months ago and it was hard for me. This was her actual first day away from home. I had sheltered her for so long. Then the day finally came where she became an adult. I tried to talk her into staying home during her first year of college but she wanted freedom. I understood because I was the same way when I moved away from home. She is my only child so I felt lonely when she left. I talk to her everyday but life hasn't been the same. Maybe if she was closer to home I would feel better. After the semester ended, I thought she would come back home, but she decided to stay. She said that was her home now. The bright side is that I had one last lunch with her at a Chinese restaurant that was near her apartment. I told her how proud I was and how much I was going to miss her. Although this has been hard for me,  I know she is becoming a young woman. The first day was just the hardest.",,3TE3O85731UAECIICDMI4BTSVI9R2B
