My husband borrowed his brother's pickup to be able to carry all her stuff.  The dorm had a list of all the stuff that she needed to get.  Of course, we bought everything on the list.  So did the other three set of parents.  The dorm was set in the mountains by the school.  It was very pretty.  The school was built there was beautiful as well.  The dorms were sets of apartments that had two bedrooms each.  Each bedroom had two roommates.  The shared a living room, kitchen and a bathroom.  They had a total of about 500 square feet in each apartment.  We had lunch at a Chinese restaurant in town together.  It was a lovely day even though our daughter left us for the first time.  It was time for her to grow up and learn about being an adult.",3TE3O85731UAECIICDMI4BTSVI9R2B,3TE3O85731UAECIICDMI4BTSVI9R2B
