That's a wild concept. My niece's high school graduation was coming up and on the eve of it, a large thunderstorm ravaged the city. I didn't think much of it, until it started to take out power lines and left the city without most of its power and seemingly underwater. It's an event that I certainly can't forget. This thunderstorm shackled a lot of our plans. In a way, however, it made it more memorable. A lot of graduation ceremonies are standard fare, with not a lot of variety between them. This, however, was special. It took creativity. It took some outside the box thinking. And we were all on board as far as I can recall. We had to make due with what was around us that night. I think that made the night more special. Nothing is ever going to be perfect, but that was close.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9G03D07
