We had planned to all meet up at a nice restaurant near downtown the evening before graduation. That evening, a large thunderstorm appeared right before my girlfriend and I were going to leave. The thunderstorm moved fast from the north and hit our area, and the city at large, with powerful winds, rain, and thunder. We live in an area of town with lots of trees, many of which were knocked down in the powerful winds and rain. It ended up knocking out the power, as well as blowing down some large branches in our front yard and a large planter stand in the back porch, ruining our potted herb garden. We didn't want to be late for the dinner, so after the storm passed we carefully started to make our way to the restaurant. Trees were down on many of the streets, and power was out throughout the city, which meant street lights were off or blinking. It was a harrowing journey to get to the restaurant, even though it was only 4 miles away, because of all the careful driving and maneuvering I had to do to avoid downed power lines, trees, flooded streets, and other cars. When we got to the restaurant we found they, too, were without power and probably wouldn't be open at all that evening.  After talking with the rest of the family, what we ended up doing was I ordered pizza from a nearby place that did have power and was open, and driving up with the food to my brothers place north of the city that still had power. Everyone met up there and we had a great time eating pizza and salad. When we got home around 11:30 that night, we still didn't have power, but it was a great evening in the end. The family seemed to have a fantastic time, despite not being able to eat at the nice restaurant. All we needed in the end was time with each other. Power came on early morning and the next day the high school graduation that evening was an amazing event to attend.  Everything that happened, good and bad, made me thankful that I have such awesome family.",3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9G03D07,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9G03D07
