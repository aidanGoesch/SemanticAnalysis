His baby was born last night and he got to hold him for the first time. Seeing his child for the first time seems to have caused my brother to have a reality check. His son looks just like him. I was able to hold him for a few minutes. He is a very beautiful baby. I hope my brother gets to spend many years raising him up to be a wonderful man. After the baby was born I spoke to my brother and asked him what his plans were. My brother said he would seek help to get over his addiction but that he couldn't afford to go to rehab with a new baby to take care of. He doesn't want to burden his girlfriend. I agree that he shouldn't leave his girlfriend with no help but I also think that addressing this problem full force  now would be a good thing. If he handles the addiction and spends a few weeks or months away from the baby then it is worth it for all the years in the future he will have with his child. He had this epiphany two months ago and from what I have seen, he appears to be clean but I know the pressure is on. I hope he can stay strong and be there for his family. I will continue to offer any assistance that I can in the mean time.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9HUM0D2
