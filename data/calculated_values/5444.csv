He finally got clean and has been clean for almost 2 years now. He hit rock bottom and robbed a bank and that was when he knew he needed to get help. He moved to New Jersey where he has been living at a sober living house. The guys there that have worked with him a phenominal. He is now running his own house there with the company. He eventually found a girlfriend and was dating her for only a couple of months when they found out she was having a baby. I am now an auntie and I could not be anymore proud of him. He overcame something that other people have a hard time doing. He is a proud daddy and I know him and his girlfriend will be great parents. He has told me time and time again that he will never go back down that road again and I believe him. He has worked so hard and my mom and family have supported him. It was striking to me that after all the relapses and stealing made him stronger. He has followed the program. He has done all of the steps in the program. He went from practically dying to actually living.,,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9HUM0D2
