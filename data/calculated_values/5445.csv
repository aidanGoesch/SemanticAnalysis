Apparently yes. I was told I was in the second half of the renewal period for my license so I thought I only had to do 2 classes to renew my license. Yesterday I found out that I need the full 24 hours to renew. I couldn't believe it in the beginning. So i went to verify it today. Yes, it is true. I need to go through much more hassle. To add salt to the wound, i found out that my salary would be delayed this month. Really? Come on! How worse can this get! Without the license, my job will go into jeopardy. And now i am facing financial trouble. I don't even have the money to spend on this.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9HUMD0F
