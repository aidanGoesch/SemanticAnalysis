She wanted to meet as soon as possible . me and my brother arrived and we both sat down. She explained that the Drs had found a mass on her right breast and they had some concerns, she asked if i could come home for sometime and stay with her. I was frightened and we both went to the first Dr. appointments together, after the biopsy. They found out it was cancer and that is was an aggressive form. So we scheduled the surgery as soon as possible. They did the surgery and they actually messed up. she was home and violently ill we took her back and they had punctured her lung and not bothered to read the x-rays after the surgery. which to me is mal-practice. She had to get a tube put in her and another surgery. We were worried the hospital may kill her if the cancer didn't. We tried to converse with a lawyer but no one would look at it. So instead we found another Dr about 2 hours north that had a way better reputation and we went with him. That was over 5 months ago and she has gone through the worst of it. the chemo was bad and afterwards the radiation we just got done with. the good news is. She is actually in remission and doing much better. I am still home looking after her and she is happy about it and so am I. we have re- kindled our relationship and we get along very good these days. In a way I'm glad it happened, but im sorry she had to go through it. but good things came from it. things I never thought could happen. we never talked much after my dad passed away, but now we are best friends and that is a blessing unto itself. Its a compelling story that has a wonderful turn out and im always glad to tell it , but it was the most scary event of my life in the beginning .",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9IHE0D5
