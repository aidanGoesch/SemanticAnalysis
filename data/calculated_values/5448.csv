I felt abnormal a way I have never felt before. I looked in the mirror and begin to cry, because I knew something was not right. What is this feeling I am describing? Well, let me tell you a little about myself. I love to exercise so, I work out about 5 to 6 days out of a week. My training sessions are normally 30 minutes to 1 hour long. I suffer from Insomnia, so I don't get adequate amount of rest. Rest is very important when you train, because your muscles need recovery time. Fast forward, today my body had enough. My muscles became extremely inflamed, so my blood was not circulating properly. I lost quite a bit of sensation which scared me. I could still walk, but overall I felt horrible. It was hard for me to explain the way I felt to anyone who tried to help me. Hopefully, I will feel myself soon the only thing that seems to help is rest.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9IHE0D5
