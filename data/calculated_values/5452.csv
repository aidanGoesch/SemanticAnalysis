I had no weakness 5 months ago. I was a successful construction worker, a drywall hanger to be more specific.  I have 3 children and a wife and I was the primary breadwinner. If you don't know much about drywall one thing that is important is the weight involved. Each sheet of 12 foot by 4 foot drywall is 70 pounds. If we are talking about 5/8 drywall the weight is 120 pounds. I lifted anywhere from 40 to 60 of these sheets everyday for 15 years. All my joints were wearing down slowly particular my neck. I enjoyed my job, but it was labor intensive and hard on my body, but I was young. This all changed 5 months ago with a injury.         One day while lifting a sheet, I felt tremendous pain that brought me to my knees. I rushed to the hospital where they did a ct scan on my abdominal cavity. I was diagnosed with a ventral hernia. I could not go back to work, I had a family to take care of and I could barely get out of bed. While I was stuck in bed my muscles were shrinking which cause a whole host of problems from pain to speech problems. I could not even speak to my children without feeling pain. I had find something to do for income, I just started selling on amazon and mturk surveys. I would like to tell you I am passed all this now, but I am still going through it and I'm yerrified everyday.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9SD4D0A
