This is or was odd for me because I've never given much thought to participating in a marathon. Nevertheless, the videos were interesting enough to make me start seriously consider training for one. After watching the videos, I started looking at workout videos - specifically, cardio workouts - to use to build up my endurance. I knew to steer clear of HIIT or high impact workouts because I didn't work out regularly. And as an older adult, I didn't want to risk hurting myself. So I settled on a few low-impact routines. I started small with a 15-minute routine.  It seemed easy enough while watching it, but some of the movements were challenging for me as a newbie. Still, I persevered.  And within a few weeks, I decided to move up to a 30-minute routine. It, too, was a little challenging. However, I was able to adjust to 15 addition minutes fairly quickly. During this time, I noticed that I had more stamina than normal. And I also lost a few pounds, which proved to be very motivating. So I started pushing myself little by little. For example, I started walking three miles a day a few times week. And once I got used to three miles, I moved up to four, five, six, seven and now I'm up to eight miles. I'm proud of myself because I've gone from being a pretty sedentary person to a highly active person within six months. And I'm looking forward to participating in my first half-marathon next year. I still have a ways to go, but I believe I will reach my 13 mile goal within the next few months.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9SJY0D3
