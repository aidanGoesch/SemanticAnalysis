Yeah, the kids were doing well and we were better off financially than we had been in a long time, but I was super unhappy with the state of my marriage. My husband had just started a new job, and while I know it was stressful and that I should give him some time to adjust, I just couldn’t stand the cold way that he was treating me. It felt like when he got home, he would hide away and play on his phone or lay on the couch watching TV – he never really made an attempt to engage with either me or the kids. I let it go for a long time, I made excuses for him, I started to blame myself – what was I doing wrong that was pushing him away? Finally, after months of living with a virtual stranger, I couldn’t take it anymore and I blew up. I said a lot of hurtful things, including bringing up and comparing him to his own deadbeat dad. He said a lot of hurtful things too, about my weight gain and diminishing sex drive. I honestly thought that we were irreconcilable and started doing the research for divorce. I even confided in my dad, just in case I would be forced to take the kids and move in with him. It was a dark time, but hindsight shows me that it was a necessary time. The fighting was cathartic and we were able to get down to the root of our issues and start over. It’s been a rocky road, but I know it was worth it because life has gotten so much better. Last month, we went on a vacation just me and him to my favorite place in the world: Florida. We spent the whole week just relaxing together on the sandy beach. Drinking cocktails, reading, laughing, people-watching and in general just reminding ourselves how much we enjoy each others company. It was an amazing time for us both and we have pledged to spend more time like this together in the future.",,3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDG4WMMM5
