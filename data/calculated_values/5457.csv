It has been a hard, last 6 months! I had to work extremely hard the last little while to keep my grades up, especially when my father passed away. I almost fell into a deep depression but with the help of my friends and family, I was able to pull out of it. The visit from my mother made all the difference in the world. I can see the strength, hope and courage she displays and her encouragement to me during this time -when she is hurting so much herself- really has helped me turn a corner in my grief. She has helped me understand that my father is not truly gone, he will always be here in our memories. So, I started today with a fresher, happier outlook, and I believe I received divine confirmation that everything will be ok, by several things that happened today. I was walking from my dorm to my first class and something caused me to look up. It was a beautiful day and not a cloud in the sky, but I plainly saw not one, but two rainbows! And the were just as clear as day! And that wasn't the end of it either -as today progressed, other things happened! I found seven pennies after my fifth class! My dad's birthday was the seventh of May! Then, after it got dark this evening, something caught my eye out the window. I looked and saw three shooting stars right in a row! Three was my dad's favorite number! Now I know, my dad is not really gone and he will be here by my side even though I can't see him, and everything is going to be alright. I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of my family next week for my graduation ceremony!",,3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDG4YEMM1
