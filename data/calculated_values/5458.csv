Towards the beginning of the month I turned 26 years old and a week or so after that I graduated from UC San Diego with an engineering degree.  It marked the beginning of my true independence and adulthood, though I may have been considered an adult before.  Upon graduating I began to realize the responsibility and pressures that life was staring to lay upon me.   Before I graduated life was very simple and my only responsibilities were to complete my education and enjoy my time in sunny San Diego.  After graduating I was tasked with finding a career that I truly enjoyed and that would also provide me with the opportunity to live comfortably for the rest of my life.  The stresses of this event were compounded by the fact that I lost my father to cancer a few months prior to graduation.  This would mean that I have to contribute to my family financially and emotionally during a time that was meant to be unique and special.  I went from enjoying the college life to stressing about the future. The loss of my father had a profound impact on my studies and my view of the world. My mother and sister flew in from far away to watch me graduate. We spent the week together sightseeing and visiting places that we would enjoy.  We also visited places that my father would have enjoyed seeing such as Naval museums and where he used to live.  It was an emotional graduation ceremony because we all knew how hard I had worked over the past six years and that my father was not there to see it through.  There were many ups and downs, including transferring from a community college to a good university, family health issues, as well as money issues.  All of these issues and triumphant events made the graduation ceremony much more meaningful to us all.  I still do not know where my life is headed, however this was a major stepping stone in my life's story and I am proud of my accomplishments.  As I look forward I hope to find a meaningful career that I can utilize the skills I have developed over the past several years.",,3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDG4YEMM1
