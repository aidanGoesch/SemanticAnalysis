She was feeling unwell for a few months. Around June she started feeling exhausted to a problematic degree. It was under my insistence she agreed to get checked up. She has always been scared of hospitals. I was feeling scared myself. But i did not express it openly. How could i? The doctors told me right away that something was wrong. 2 days of extensive tests. Breast cancer. Thankfully, it is just in the starting stage. It was a huge blow to me though. Surprisingly, mom was calm when she got the news. Perhaps she knew it somehow deep in her.",,3TGOYF991Y8BEGJ1ZRRTF5B4K62UU1
