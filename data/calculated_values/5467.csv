This college was Harvard. I took the SAT many times to get in. I am still shocked that I got into the school. I got a nearly perfect score on one SAT. I did write a very impressive essay about how to solve wars. I said that you just need to be in business with each other, so you are reliant on each other. This will reduce the chances of war. I will be majoring in law. This will be a hard task for me. I will need to study a lot. I will need lots of coffee. I hope I can meet some friends to ease the stress. It's a big college, so this shouldn't be a problem. I hope I'll graduate someday.",,3TK8OJTYM27YZQ05NV241LQOHMUPV7
