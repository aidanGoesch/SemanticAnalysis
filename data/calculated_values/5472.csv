I have a friend in Denver. He uses cannabis so he invited me over. I boarded a train from Chicago to Denver to try cannabis for the first time. On my way to Denver, i shopped in a dispensary and bought edibles. After i tried the cannabis, i felt good and was ready to go back to Chicago. I boarded another train to Chicago. On my way to Chicago, i was hungry and ate the edibles. Shortly after i ate the edibles, i fell asleep. It took me 6 hours before i woke up. I called my friend to tell him what happened. He laughed and said that was because it was my first time. I was nervous and first but it felt good. I wanted to try again. That was all.",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11EC9X08WI
