SO I PLANNED A SURPRISE PARTY FOR HER THAT IS TO CELEBRATE HER BIRTHDAY IN AN ORPHANAGE.  I INVITED ALL MY FRIENDS TO THAT EVENT AND EVEN PLANNED OF PROPOSING HER ON THAT SPECIAL OCASSION. EVERYTHING WENT WELL AS I HAD PLANNED. SHE WAS VERY MUCH SURPRISED AND DID NOT EXPECT SUCH A SURPRISE PARTY  FROM ME. SHE WAS VERY EMOTIONAL ABOUT THAT. SHE HUGGED ME TIGHTLY ON SEEING THOSE ORPHAN CHILDREN. I FELT EMOTIONAL TOO. THEN WHEN THE PARTY WAS ABOUT TO GET OVER WE PROVIDED FOOD FOR THOSE CHILDERN. FINALLY WHEN I WAS READY TO PROPOSE HER A MIRACLE HAPPENED. SHE CAME TO ME, HUGGED ME TIGHTLY AND SUDDENLY HER EYES BURST INTI TEARS. THEN SHE HUGGED ME EVEN TIGHTLY THAN BEFORE AND SAID THAT SHE LOVED ME FROM THE FIRST MOMENT WE MET AND FELT THAT THIS WAS THE RIGHT SITUATION TO TELL ME. I WAS SPEECHLESS. I FELT BLESSED AND SPECIAL. I REPLIED THAT I LOVE HER TOO. THEN WE THANKED THE CHILDREN AND THE OPERATORS OF THE ORPHANGE FOR LETTING US HAVE THE MOST IMPORTANT MOMENT IN OUR LIFE WITH THEM.",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11ECYKV8WC
