I was never the one to work a regular nine to five job. As a security officer, I did not enjoy the job. I wanted more flexibility and control. I prefer to work when I want, and play when I want. This can only be possible as an entrepreneur. So I decided to quit my job. I left and never looked back. I put in my notice, and resigned. I have tried different businesses so far, but nothing has worked. I am researching others to get into. However, I am also taking the TEFL certification. This allows me to teach English. This can get me income while on my hustle. I think it will work.",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11ECZ1IW8M
