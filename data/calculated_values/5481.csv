I had a slight idea of what I wanted to do but nothing thorough. After I put in my 2 week notice I started to become doubtful. Here I am, 3 months later and still pretty doubtful about my success to be honest. I don't regret quitting though. I feel like if I were to stay in a secure position I would never grow as a person or become what I truly want to become in life. So, the plan was to start a career as a reseller. I went to a bunch of different thrift shops and found quality clothing items that I could sell for more than the purchasing price. So far sales have been slow, so I'm almost at the point to where I have to go back to security. But before I go back Im going after my TEFL certification  to become an online English teacher to Chinese students. Teaching English online will allow me to work from home, on my on time, which will give me the freedom I need to continue to pursuit my entrepreneurial dreams. In life I strongly believe that in order to grow people must take risks. Yeah, what I'm doing is very risky but I think it'll pay off greatly. I'm meant to be an entrepreneur. I'll be successful no matter what.",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11ECZ1IW8M
