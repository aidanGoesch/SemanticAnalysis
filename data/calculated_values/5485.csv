First it was just extra money that I had left over from birthday gifts and holiday gifts. When I got older and started working I added money from my paycheck that I didn't need to use at the time. The money was a lifesaver after I got married and had some kids. Sometimes when I don't have enough money in pay check from work I used my savings money to pay for bills. Fortunately, for the most part my job is stable enough that I was able rely on that money in order to pay for necessities in life. I also loved using that money for anything that my kids needed. It always felt so great to be able to use some extra money for the kids that didn't come out of my regular money and wouldn't affect my budget too much. The biggest reward of the whole thing, of course, was to see their smiling faces when I gave them a wonderful present that they had been so hopeful for. Then, three months ago, tragedy struck! For some odd reason my husband decided that he needed that money more than me and the kids. He just took half of the money out of my savings account without telling me or giving me any sort of reason! He's been completely evasive about the whole situation since it's happened and has never given me any sort of reasoning for doing that. It's upset me tremendously since I've lost so much money that I worked so hard to collect. Worse than that is that I can't buy my kids all of the things that they want and they completely deserve which depresses me since now I don't get to see their faces light up with joy when I do give them a present. Fortunately I am still working and generally money itself is not too much of a problem but this whole situation has been a giant drain on me and my life. It's just very frustrating and upsetting to think that someone who supposedly loved me so much and was raising our kids would just do this to us. I think about putting more money towards my savings account so I can rebuild what I had but then I'm not sure if I would have enough money to cover the regular bills and other daily necessities. I can't really explain what happened to my kids because they idolize him so much that they would never be able to understand this and they would just ask me a million questions that I can't answer. I would love answers myself because I truly just have no idea about anything that's been going on here. 4",,3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LVCW12
