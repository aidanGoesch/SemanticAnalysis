My husband and I had a joint checking and savings account that we had our checks deposited into. I had gotten paid the day before, and I was at work when I got a call from him on my break. He said that he saw a Black Friday Sale at Kohl's, and wanted to buy a Playstation 4. I said okay, but he left the part out where he was going to take my paycheck that was deposited the day before to pay for it. So when I checked my account later on, I saw that he already transferred and withdrew a majority of my paycheck (around 400 dollars) to buy the PS4 on Black Friday. That paycheck was to go toward the bills that I was responsible for, and to buy the kids Christmas gifts. I spoke to him and got him to wait until he got paid to actually buy the PS4 with his own money instead of  knowingly using the money that was allocated to something else. Overall, I felt betrayed and hurt. I was also confused because, in my opinion, normal people don't do things like that. He tried to justify it by saying that we could play on it too. There have been a few other instances of things like this happening, but the Black Friday PS4 debacle was one that was really notable for me. I think it's because so many parents go through a lot of trouble to make sure that their children actually get gifts for Christmas, instead of taking money away and spending it on themselves. Now I have my own personal checking and savings account, and have been contributing to bills, and buying Christmas gifts for the kids months in advance. As far as my husband is concerned, I've been adding a few small gifts into the grocery list (we use a pick up app) so he is still financially contributing to buying Christmas gifts for the children without actually having to go out and do it.",3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LVCW12,
