I  had the rest of my savings in our shared account (what was left since I lost my job), which was around 750 to 800 dollars. So he took about half of it. He said that he was spending the money on bills, but I doubt it. You don't need to withdraw cash from the ATM to pay bills. I was going to transfer some of the savings to my checking to put toward a bill, and to get started ahead of time on school supply shopping for my oldest. Then  I saw that like half of the money was gone. I confronted my husband about it, and he was super casual about the whole thing. Like ""Oh. 400 dollars? That's fine. It's money that YOU made, so it doesn't matter. It's actually my money anyway"". I think that the most memorable (and chilling) thing about the entire incident was the ""flat affect"" that he gave off when he didn't think that anyone aside from me was looking (in regard to this situation). He kept up the flat affect until I told someone about what happened. It was like a light switch, and it was like he had to ""pretend"" to feel bad about what he did. Living with someone who seems to lack remorse for taking things from people is pretty memorable, I would say",3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LVCW12,3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LVCW12
