We decided to take a little road trip with them to Indianapolis to visit the children's museum and zoo for the weekend while they were here. The trip wasn't too far and the traffic wasn't bad either, we made pretty good time. The weather was nice for the entirety of the trip, mid 80's and sunny, nothing to complain about. The children's museum was quite interesting and had a ton of interactive things for the kids to mess around with. They looked to be having fun and were running from exhibit to exhibit to see everything the museum had to offer. After they had seen everything there we stopped at the cafe inside to grab some lunch before heading out of the museum and over to the zoo which was conveniently located nearby. The zoo was pretty big so we knew it would take up the remainder of the day, luckily it was only noon so we had plenty of time to see everything. We looked over the map of the zoo to see what we wanted to check out first, the kids wanted to see the large safari animals like the elephants and tigers so that's where we headed first. There was a vehicle you could board that would give you a drive by tour of the animals so we hopped on. We saw elephants, lions, zebras, giraffes and several other animals which the kids liked. They were pointing and trying to take some pictures with their phones. One of the elephants came extremely close to the vehicle and the children couldn't believe what they were seeing. To everyone's surprise, the elephant let out a loud sound that scared everyone, but the tour guide assured us that it was completely normal and to not be afraid. The children were laughing after it happened. After the ride we got off and walked around the rest of the zoo until my cousins' feet began hurting and we decided to call it a day. It was getting dark by then anyways and we left to go find a place for dinner. All in all it was a very good day that everyone enjoyed. We had one more day in Indianapolis and then would head back to Chicago.",,33C7UALJVMKX7MLQU0G48BOIDKW81O
