While on my visit, I got to see two of my favorite bands at a venue that is on my bucket list, Red Rocks. They were a week apart and were both amazing shows. The first show I got to go with my sister and it was electric. You could feel the magic in the air. Everyone at the concert was so happy to be in that place at that moment which really connected us all. I've never felt almost fellowship at a concert like this. The second show I went alone and had just as good a time, but it was more introverted as I went alone. I got to see my all-time favorite band at that concert and it was as good as I could have hoped for, even got my current favorite song played at encore. I walked away from the whole experience satisfied, but a little bit sad. My bucket list had a big tick on it now. All in all it was every bit of an amazing experience as I had hoped for. I am currently searching out new items to add to my bucket list now. I greatly enjoyed visiting my brother's family as well. This is the first time I had seen them since they moved to Colorado. I imagine this visit will become an annual thing.",3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4T2XW19,
