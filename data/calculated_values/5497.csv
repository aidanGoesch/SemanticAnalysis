My fiance proposed to me for the second time, because he didn't like how he did it the first time. I was standing in the kitchen, and he came home and he said he wanted to speak with me. He got down on his knee in front of me and he took a small jewelry box out of his pocket. He took my hand and he said to me that he had always been disappointed by the way he asked me to marry him the first time. He didn't really have a ring, and he kind of just blurted it out awkwardly. I didn't really mind that much, and was still in love with him and excited to be engaged, but I knew what he meant, I was nervous the first time he asked me and I hesitated for far too long. He opened the box and there was a small, plain ring inside with just a few small diamonds on a white gold band. I loved it immediately. I had previously explained to him that I liked more practical and less flashy jewelry but whenever we had looked at rings, I got the impression he didn't understand my taste. I was so surprised at how perfect it was, and how well he seemed to understand everything I told him, and then he explained to me that the diamonds were from his grandmothers wedding ring that she had left to him when she died, and he had had them reset for or me in a plain band. I loved it even more. He asked me to marry him again and I cried a little bit and said yes. The way he proposed the first time would have been fine. We still would have still been in love, and gotten married and been happy, but this is a nicer story to tell our children and friends and families.",3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675VKZGO7L,
