Maybe this is why so many of us put off— or avoid— meeting our metamours. Yet, there is something irreplaceable about making the space to get to know those connected to who we’ve been building a relationship with. Not only do we have at least one entire person in common with our metamours, but we also have personalities, cultures, and preferences that might not be met elsewhere. I was a bit hesitant about building a relationship with my polygamous partner, but as I read some articles such as the one posted above, I slowly drew into the idea that it might not be so bad after all.  Thus, a month ago, my partner introduced me to his other partner (his girlfriend). We had a short pleasant chat for a few hours and then went about our daily business. During that month again, my partner's other girlfriend reached out to me that she wanted all the 3 of us to go to a quiet cafe during the night and have a discussion with each other so we could get to know more about ourselves. I told my partner and he agreed. Thus 2 weeks ago, the 3 of us went to a cafe named the raising rabbit. The cafe was pleasantly beautiful and a bit empty, so we had a lot of time for ourselves. The menu they had was also great. We had a great chat and got to know exactly what each other liked and wanted in the relationship, how we should behave around each other, e.t.c. After we had done that, we decided to take a walk downtown. The walk was really nice, especially because the weather was so good while the skies were really clear that evening. We shared a quiet, happy evening together after the walk. It was such a great day.",,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZOJCWQ
