I also have a master's degree in career and technical education administration.  I am passionate about both; however, my long-term goal is to hold a district-level or higher leadership position in career and technical education.  In the district I have worked for the last several years, I was given the opportunity to be both special education teacher and career and technical education coordinator.  I had to do both simultaneously and I was given about a $2000 increase in pay for the added responsibility.  I had this unique arrangement for one year.  It was the most stressful year of my life and I routinely worked over 80 hours a week.  Toward the end of the year, I knew I was not going to be able to continue in this arrangement.  However, the district was putting forth a referendum to the community and one outcome of a passed referendum would be enough funding to split the career and technical education job off and make it standalone.  Unfortunately, the referendum failed and there was no money to pay for the jobs to be separate.  This meant I had to make a very difficult, tough decision to give up on career and technical education administration for the time being and take a job as a special education teacher in a neighboring district.  This was one of the hardest choices I have had to make; but, for the first time ever, I put myself and family ahead of my career and made the switch.  Then, a few weeks ago, the assistant superintendent of my former district called me and said they had found a way to offer me the career and technical education administration position without special education responsibilities, which is what I had originally been looking for.  However, I would have to also be the district's data and assessment coordinator and my salary would still be the same.  The chance to continue down the path of my career aspirations was so incredibly tantalizing.  On the other hand, the school year is about to start and I really like my new district a lot, the community is supportive, benefits are excellent, and I feel good about my future there.  The difficulty of the decision felt suffocating.  I actually threw up I was so anxious about it.  But, in the end, I decided to stick with my choice to take care of myself and told my old district that I could not come back.  I have thought about it a lot the last few weeks, and I am still glad I made that decision.  With students coming back to school in a week, we will quickly find out if I am still happy with my choice!",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B9XBHWM,30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B9XBHWM
