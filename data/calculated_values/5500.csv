We're poly, and that's important to me. We went out to a really nice cafe together, known for having good vegan options in town. It was a really stressful thing, trying to find places that would actively cater to my friend/my partner's partner. But, we found this place, and set out to go together. They were vastly understaffed, but the food was good and it was a quiet, gentle atmosphere. We took pictures together before we ate, and the meal was really nice to share. My partner sat between us, and we were all on a booth seat. We had a nice conversation and enjoyed the food. After that, we went out on a walk together throughout the town. It was a really nice experience, being able to be publicly affectionate without the worry of judgement. No one around here really knew us, we're just visitors. It's not like it'd have a lasting effect on us if they wanted to be upset with us for being visibly queer and non-monogamous. The feeling of safety and warmth of getting to spend time with my family, walking around, admiring the sunset and enjoying our meal together was wonderful. I will remember this day for a very long time. We had to go home that next day, but that night was one of the most memorable, holding hands freely in public, taking pictures, even being able to kiss in public. It was a nice feeling, that we rarely got to have, one that was set in a stunning backdrop of a quiet downtown and a cute vegan-friendly cafe. It almost seems like it couldn't be real, from how much fun we had.",,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZOJCWQ
