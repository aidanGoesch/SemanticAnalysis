This year was different because neither of my twins wanted to go to Summer camp. They felt at age 13, that they were too old for camp. Because of this, I didn't get my usual 2 week break to relax and have some me time. The boys made a list of the things they wanted to do. We went to the Zoo one day. We went to an amusement park. We went miniature golfing. We rented canoes on a lake nearby. One weekend we went hiking. Another weekend we went camping. We went to a museum. And generally had a good time each day whatever we decided to do. I tried to keep the boys busy throughout each day so that they wouldn't be tempted to spend days on the couch playing video games.  Or being on their computers. All in all we had a very nice Summer. The boys not only had fun, but they learned some things. I must say that as the Summer was coming to a close, I really thought that I was looking forward to them heading back to school. But once they went back, I really missed them and it made me sad. The house seemed very empty each day. Especially for the first month. I was surprised. I thought I so wanted my alone time.  I eventually got back into my daily routine, but I was very thankful for the quality time we spent together. I am looking forward to next Summer and I am sure we will share many more adventures together.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5XL3P3L
