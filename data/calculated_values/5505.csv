I haven't been without a child at home for nearly 16 years now.  We spent all summer preparing for back to school, including school supplies and new clothes.  Yesterday was the first day back for three of my children.  I watched them each get on the bus and was comforted knowing that they would be okay.  They've all done this before.  My youngest went to orientation yesterday for two hours, but I would drive her there and be around her the whole time.  She was okay and happy.  Then today arrived.  I've been nervous and fidgety.  My baby was going to ride the bus for the first time and spend a whole day without me.  The day I've been looking forward to all summer has somehow become a day I wish didn't arrive so quickly.  Nobody was more surprised by my change of emotions as much as I was.  I fought tears watching her walk up the stairs to the bus.  She said hi to her bus driver and took her seat like a champ.  Just a few minutes ago I received a message from her teacher that everything is going swimmingly.  I panicked for nothing, but I still want to scoop my child up and protect her.  I just don't know from what.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5XL3P3L
