It sort of becomes a part of you. It never really goes away. And that's true for me. Even though it had been nearly two years since the event, the wounds don't fully heal. They can scab over, scar up, and become less noticeable but they're all unfortunate errors in this painting of my life. Nobody deserves to have people taken away from them like this. It's incredibly bitter to swallow. It's made more bitter by the fact that these shootings appear to be more commonplace than ever before. It's hard to imagine we let ourselves get to this point. I can't really believe it myself. These scars are still very fresh. They still cut incredibly deeply. It's just an unfortunate learning experience. But one that will never be forgotten. I hope the families find peace someday.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5XVP3P5
