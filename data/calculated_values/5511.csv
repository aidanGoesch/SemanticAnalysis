It is such an amazing place! The beaches are fantastic and the people are really nice. I got a job at a swanky hotel just driving people to and from the airport. Most people were really good tippers and we had great conversations. There are a lot of gay people in the Keys. Even though I am not gay, I love being around them because they are so friendly when they feel they are accepted. Everything is so relaxed around here. There was only one argument I noticed on the beach. A couple were arguing and the woman threw her drink in the man's face and walked off. He tried to grab her but a couple of men grabbed him and told him he should leave her alone. I don't know the whole story but I'm glad it did not escalate and the woman was able to get away from him. He was loud and probably drunk. This brought back some memories for me that I would rather not think about. There was always someone grabbing me when I was young and I had to get away from them. So I really feel the woman's pain. I'm glad she was able to stand up for herself and throw a drink in his face. Like I said, it was the only incident out of character for this whole trip. Everything else was fantastic. I even made some new friends and got a few addresses and phone numbers. I will definitely be coming back!",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP93PE
