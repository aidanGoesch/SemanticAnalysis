She had practiced her smile and how she would walk across the stage to receive her diploma. She made me pretend to be her audience while she practiced her ceremonial speech. She was the valedictorian and this was a day. I listened as she stumbled over words, her hands trembled and she sweated profusely as she practice that speech over and over again. I assured her that she would be just fine and she trusted me. My daughter is a perfectionist so she had written a ""to do list"" for the day of the ceremony. My one and only job was to make sure I had the camera.  My daughter biggest day was a big disappointment. To a certain degree I felt like I had failed my child, I was so sad.  Despite all the preparation and and ALL the practice, the day of the ceremony was a huge ball of blurriness. I became more and more anxious as the day progresses. I mentally went over what I had to bring along so that my big baby's day would be perfect! I remembered everything except the camera. I couldn't get the professional pics I wanted but I do have all the memories! Great memories!",3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODRAJJ6S,
