It's great to know that I am partially responsible for impacting our future. That being said, some jobs are only temporary. About three months ago I had started to really feel this hard, and it was starting to affect my psyche. I had probably been experiencing burnout for a long time and had only realized it just before it was time to leave. I just wasn't doing a good job overall. It was time for me to move on. It was time to do something more for me. My last day was bittersweet. So many faces I had seen over the years. So many lives I hopefully have positively influenced. It was hard saying goodbye. It was hard leaving the building for the last time. But it had to be done. I look forward to the next chapter.",,3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z
