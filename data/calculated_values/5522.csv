It had years of strong leadership and enrollment. My children had attended the school and were still there when I got the teaching job. The principal stepped down a month after he hired me and took a vacant teaching position. An inexperienced teacher took the principal position. At the end of the year we were told they were going to close the school due to past financial debt the school was unable to pay back. The school community refused to let that happen and with a stroke of luck was able to raise the money on a vigorous fundraising campaign in only two months. The next year uncertainty loomed as enrollment had dwindled. By my third year things seemed great until they fired the principal without explanation, brought in a new person from another school that last two months and then left us with threats of closing the school again because there was no principal. Parents again spoke up against the vindictive leadership and the superintendent brought in another principal. It was evident immediately the principal was incompetent and had no clue how to comb her hair let alone run a school. The loving vibe became negative and toxic. After a few bizarre run ins with the principal I made the conclusion I was not going to continue working in such a hostile environment. Rather than abruptly quitting before the school year ended, which I had seriously thought about, I resigned two weeks before school ended. I have no regrets. I listened to my gut on the decision and when people tell you to listen to your gut because there must be a reason they are right. When the new school year started I started hearing stories about what is going on at the school and all I can think is thank goodness I left. I am happy and have moved on to a much better working environment.",3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z,
