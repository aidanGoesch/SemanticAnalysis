It was a happy and emotional occasion. I was happy to be moving on to other opportunities, but it was also bittersweet as I would miss my students. Some I had watched grow up. There were happy goodbyes, a few tears, and knowing I probably wouldn't see most of the people I worked with anymore. There were some surprises that day when parents brought me gifts and cards telling me how much they had appreciated me as their child's teacher. Some of those parents I had no idea how they felt, so it was very nice knowing I had made an impact. One parent even cried as she gave me a hug. It was completely unexpected! As I got in my car that after noon after taking the last of my things, I knew my time at the school had made a difference. But I was excited to drive off and end that adventure and get ready for my next. I still hear from a few parents who have become my friends through the years. I also hear about how my former students are doing. Teaching is not an easy job. Some days you just want to throw in the towel. But at the end of the day it's very rewarding. I will miss it.",3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z,3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z
