I thought it would never happen because it looks so grim at first. Trying to own a home is something that sounds like a dream to be honest. With the economgy getting a lot of growth I thought I would not be able to take advantage of it but I was in fact able to advantage of it. Thank you God for giving me the opportunity to live this life. It's something I am truly grateful. Now i got to look for equipment for the bakery and furniture for the place. I dont know but I am so excited for this next chapeter in my life.. I never knew this would happen. Not now. But I am glad that it is. I am truly ready for the next step. Now I can run again. I am free again. I know hard work pays off. Now we can enjoy it.",3TS1AR6UQR0KXNAFRU3JJDWHUBK7F5,
