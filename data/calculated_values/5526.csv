But today I am moving to a new house. And I am so excited because it’ll be a new start. At my old school I didn’t have many friends but maybe here people will appreciate my creativity. But there’s a downside because if I don’t fit in here I won’t know what to do. Have you ever had trouble fitting in? What am I thinking you’re just a diary. You can’t talk! All I am saying is that I am glad to have a fresh beginning and I am going to tell you about all of the adventures I go on in my new home. I have to go but I’ll tell you more later. Oh by the way I am also starting my new bakery this fall. Icannot believe it's finally here. Now we can serve so many customers and do so much more things. It pays to be disciplined. I know how things work for the most thanks to the investors I have. I will not let them down.",3TS1AR6UQR0KXNAFRU3JJDWHUBK7F5,3TS1AR6UQR0KXNAFRU3JJDWHUBK7F5
