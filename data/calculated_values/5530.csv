It was very frightening. I was walking home from the subway. It was late at night. I was alone. I am came up behind me and demanded that I give him my wallet. He had something in his pocket that looked like a knife or gun. I didn't want to find out what it was. He was large and intimidating. He shouted at me. I was very scared. I gave him my wallet. It had about $150 in it plus my credit cards. He ran off after I gave him my wallet. I called the police and they took down my story. I had to cancel all my credit cards. It was very harrowing for me.  I was very scared of the event and I think about it alot these days.,,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IGKWQ1S
