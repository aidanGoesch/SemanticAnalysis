I thought it would be fun to take dad on a fishing trip. He told me he used to fish with his dad as a kid. I thought the experience would make him happy. I didnt realize how stressful it would be getting an 80 year old man onto a fishing boat. I had gone numerous times with my friends. It was always fun and relaxing. Not this time, this time was different. Dad had seemed happy to go with me at first. As the actual trip got closer though you could tell he was getting anxious. Maybe he was afraid of being away from home all day. Maybe he was afraid about being unable to swim. I thought about cancelling the trip but he had told my mom he was looking forward to it. I decided I would go through with it no matter what. I stopped at his house to pick him up the morning of the trip and he was sitting at the kitchen table in his fishing gear. He had on his rubber boots and a big hat. He was holding a fishing pole. It was so cute I almost cried. He really was excited. ,And he really did enjoy himself. The stress of setting everything up and getting him ready was nothing compared to how excited he looked when I was him that morning. It wound up being a great experience.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IXDYQ1X
