It came as a huge shock to us, because money had been tight and my parents had decided we wouldn't go on vacation this year. My dad's boss has a cabin on the lake and they gifted us a long weekend there because he was a long valued employee of his company. We packed up the car and drove 2 hours to Crowe's lake. We arrived at the cabin and were amazed at how nice it was. Spacious ground floor and a loft with beds upstairs that overlooks the cabin. Once we unloaded everything and mom left to get groceries, my dad said he had one more thing to show us. We went out the back of the cabin that faces the lake. There was a small shed off to the side. He took out some keys and fiddled with the lock before opening up the door. There were inter tubes and a jet ski inside that we were allowed to use. My brother and I took turns on riding the jet ski. He would drive and I would ride shot gun and then we would take turns. The lake was beautiful. My dad got a bunch of pictures of us while he stood on the dock and watched. Later that evening we set up a fire in the fire pit and roasted hot dogs and made s'mores. It was an amazing time.",,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP225XLS
