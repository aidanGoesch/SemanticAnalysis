The last time I had a miniature dachshund was 5 years ago. My last puppy was 17 when she passed on. My son found the new puppy and paid 100 dollar deposit to hold her. We were so excited to welcome this new puppy.  The day finally came that we were going to drive down to get her. It was over 400 miles away that we were going to drive to get her. We got about 200 miles into our trip when the car broke down. We had to be towed back home. The car ended up being in the shop for over a week. We missed out on getting the puppy. My son had to forfeit his 100. dollar deposit. It was a very disappointing time. Happy news though we have found a new puppy only six miles away that we are getting in October.,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK
