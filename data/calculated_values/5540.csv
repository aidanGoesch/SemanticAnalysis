I decided to get an apartment with my girl friend.  This really helped my mental health out very much.  It made life much easier having a place to ourselves and i was very nice.  I remember the moving process was a pain but in the end it was worth it.  It really helped me look at life in a more positive way.  If you work hard you will get the things that you want in life. I worked very hard to move out of my parents house and now i finally did it.  This was a huge jump start in my life.  This made me very proud to have worked so hard to move out. I had to save thousands of dollars and it was well worth it.  It helped my mental health because it made me grow up.  It made me see life in a  different way than i did before. It helped my girlfriend and i grow closer.  We are now engaged and i think the move helped.,,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZECWWT1
