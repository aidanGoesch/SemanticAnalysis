My friend Trudy texted me to let me know she was nearby and could we meet for lunch. We texted back and forth and finally agreed to meet at a local casino in thirty minutes and try the buffet. I drove to the casino and found a place to park in the garage in the shade. Nothing quite as much fun as returning to your car when it is 110 degrees outside and the inside of the car is considerably hotter from sitting in the sun. We found each other in the casino and headed upstairs to the buffet. Soon we were in the line choosing what we each would have.  I choose the prime rib with sweet potatoes. Trudy choose the broiled salmon with Hollander sauce.  We sat down at our tale and began to catch up on what was going on in our lives . It had been some time since we has actually sat down and caught up.  I commented on how I missed seeing her and she mentioned that she felt the same. Perhaps we should make an effort to get together more often   We finished  up our meal up with a cup of coffee and some delicious pastry from the desert line. On our way out we decided to try our luck at one of the many slot machines in the casino. Wow what a good idea !  We each  found a machine to play . With in a few minutes I had hit a jackpot  of $1000. 00 ! While I was waiting for the machine to clear Trudy hit a jock pot also ! What a great lunch !  We both made a few dollars on their lunch break. The family will benefit from my wonderful lunch. We agreed to meet again soon !",3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZLLPTWG,
