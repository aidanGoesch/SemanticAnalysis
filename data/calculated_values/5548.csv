However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind. This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home. I loved my grandfather so much. I was so close to him. He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot. We always had so much fun together. So I had to go out of state for some work related issues for about two weeks or so. In that time my grandfather was really fit and had no health issues whatsoever. However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now. I had no words to say. I got so panic and did not know what to do. I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours. I had no choice but to wait for the flight. Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day. I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him. Anyway finally, after waiting for couple hours I took the flight and went straight to the hospital. When I reached there I saw that everyone crying and hugging each other. I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa? Is he okay? She said “he is no more, he left us”. When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend. A friend that I used to share everything of my life. That was a big loss of my life. I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.",3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI
