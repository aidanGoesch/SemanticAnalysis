I've know my friend for years. We grew up together, we were in school together all the way through high school. We went to separate colleges and still maintained a solid relationship. When I had time or he had time we would call each other to catch up and just shoot the breeze for a while. If we couldn't talk over the phone, we would at least shoot each other a text to make sure we were okay. After we both finished college we moved back home. He studied Criminal Justice and pursued a career in Law Enforcement, I studied Engineering and started working with a small firm. Our careers took us different places and we started drifting apart. We would still call each other occasionally and grab a bite to eat if we were free. From time to time we would go to a bar or a brewery and get a beer or to to catch up. Once he got married these meet ups became few and far between. He's busy and I understand that. Establishing a family is no easy feat, but we were good friends and then it suddenly changed. After a while we just cut off communication. One I gave him a call to see what was going on and if he wanted to get some lunch. We went to an Italian place that we both like. We talked for a bit and enjoyed our meals. Both of us came to the realization that this could be our last meal and we kind of left it at that. This was two months ago and I haven't seen or spoken to him since.",,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZW44TW8
