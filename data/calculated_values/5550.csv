I had been close friends with someone for a number of years. Til two months ago we had a falling out over something stupid. It all started when we started to drift apart and talk less and less. Til one day it just blew up in both our faces and we realized neither one of us was happy with the current situation. So we stopped being friends. This all started when we sat down and discussed our friendship and what we wanted out of it. Neither one of us could come to a agreement on what we should do to change things. So at the end of the day we both decided that we had just out grew each other and it was time to go out and find new friends who shared the same interest. It was a very heart breaking day since we had been friends for the last eight years.  This type of a event was  a emotional one that i will probably never forget about in my life. It's significant to me because we used to be so close and now we're nothing. I still think about this event everyday and what our friendship meant to me. It's been a very hard and long couple of months. I'm still grateful for the experiences that we shared and wouldn't want to forget them for anything. I just sometimes wish things had turned out differently than they are now.,,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZW44TW8
