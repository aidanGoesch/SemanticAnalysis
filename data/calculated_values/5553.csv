It is a little weird because all of my family for the last 3 generations had boys. I will be the talk of the town with my family after this. My mom hugged me a week after having the child. My father gave a hug and had a bit of a cry. My brothers all gave me high fives. My daughter is usually in a happy mood. She did puke after eating some bad baby food. She is growing up nicely. The baby clothes fit greatly on her. They were a blue shirt and some red pants. She looked great in the clothes. She almost said a word. I think it was ketchup but I wasn't sure. I hope she has a happy life.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DADW94UH
