I have always wanted a daughter and never imagined that I would be having one. All of my family, including cousins, aunts, uncles, and anyone for the past 3 generations has had boys. There are no girls in our family over those 3 generations. The day that we had the revealing ultrasound was one of the happiest days of my life. The day she was born was the best and it was unimaginable how it would change my life. I am so thankful and grateful for having her. I couldn't imagine life being any other way. The amount of love that I never imagined having blew me away. When she was brought out, I remember the look she had. It was almost as if she was looking at me and could see every notion of my being. I know she couldn't see, but it sure felt like it. Her eyes were looking directly at me and she didn't whimper one bit. That day is a day I could never forget. It was the most beautiful and captivating face I have ever seen. My daughter who looked exactly like me. It's crazy to think about it, but she sis a spitting image of myself.",3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DADW94UH,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DADW94UH
