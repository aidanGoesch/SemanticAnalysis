The dissolution of my first marriage has been weighing heavy on my mind. I was never happy. That is what it comes down to. I wasn't happy in my marriage. I wasn't happy at work. I wasn't happy period.  I couldn't figure out why I was so miserable. My husband was great. He tried so hard. But eventually I just blamed him. I started being nasty. I pushed him away all the time. I hated when he did nice things for me. I hated everything, even the things that had nothing to do with him. Sometimes I wonder if I could go back in time and be kinder if things would have ended differently.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK6WU4L
