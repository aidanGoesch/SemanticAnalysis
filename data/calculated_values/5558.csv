We had nothing on our calendar for the first time in ages. We hopped in the car and headed out to get our supplies for the day. First we went and grabbed a few movies from our local movie rental place. Thankfully they had a deal on older movies so we managed to get four of them for only a few bucks. Then we went to our supermarket and bought tons of junk food. The best stuff you could find. Then we went back home and devoured all of our snacks. We had cookies, brownies, frozen pizzas, chips, and popcorn. We then sat on the couch and watched 80's and 90's movies all day. We enjoyed the opportunity to show our son some of the movies made before he was born, and it's nice that he's at an age where we can actually experience this with him. Most of the movies were comedy flicks, so we were laughing and having a great time well into the evening hours. After another frozen pizza and a few more cookies for all of us, we finally turned in for bed. All in all it was a great day spent doing very little other than bonding with our son. He was so excited to see older movies that he wants to do the same exact thing in two weeks!",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK6X4UW
