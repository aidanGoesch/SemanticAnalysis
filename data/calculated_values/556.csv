I trusted your dad completely, but a baby is a big, life-changing thing. You scared me, little girl. I went in for a regular check-up the day before you were due. My blood pressure was really high, and they told me that I needed to have you that day. I felt every emotion at the same time: nervous, excited, anxious, happy, relieved, nauseous. I didn't know what to expect, and I wasn't fully able to comprehend that I was about to hold you in a few hours. The next 12 hours were all pain. I cried, I resented you and your dad, I drifted in and out of sleep. I just wanted it to be over, I wasn't even thinking about getting to meet you. All excitement was gone. I just wanted everything to stop. Then I heard you cry. Oh, my God. Your cry brought me whooshing back into the present. It was the only thing I heard. They handed you to me, still covered in my blood and your goo. You were purple and angry and wrinkly. You were so beautiful. You were so perfect. Nothing else existed in the whole world while I was looking at you. Every day I look at you and think about how amazing you are and how perfectly I made you and how lucky I am to have you. I would do it all again 100 times for you.",33CID57105FOWWJOBT3R19PLU2RL3S,33CID57105FOWWJOBT3R19PLU2RL3S
