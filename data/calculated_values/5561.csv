Never in my wildest dreams had i thought this year would be like this. I got stabbed for godsakes! It happened at the local 7-11. We were coming back after a concert, me and mary. Mary went to fill gas in the car, and i went to the 7-11 to get something to drink. I knew that it was a dangerous neighborhood. But who would expect to get stabbed? A masked man came rushing in, and grabbed on to my purse. I fought back. The last thing i remember was seeing a box cutter. He had stabbed me. Mary called the cops and i was rushed into the hospital for an exploratory surgery. Dealing with the cops was even more frustrating. I badly need to see a therapist. It is surprising how hard it is to find a good therapist these days.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD
