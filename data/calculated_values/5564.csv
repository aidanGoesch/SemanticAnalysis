I was processed.  I then began treatment for clinical depression and suicidal thoughts.  While there, I interacted with several people including treatment specialists and other patients.  I realized that I was not diagnosed.  I did not react to the medication they prescribed. I also realized my depression was a manifestation of my own psyche.  I subsequently left after about a week, determined to solve my problem on my own.  I have subsequently renewed my relationships with my family members and friends.  This is an attempt to create a support network.  I also weaned myself off of alcohol and any mind altering drugs to see if that helps.  I've begun to attend Buddhist temple services.

My work continues to be drudgery, but it is simple and I'm well compensated.
