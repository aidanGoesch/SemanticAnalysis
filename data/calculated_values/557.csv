So i thought to myself ill give it a shot and maybe throw it up on social media for a few likes. so i wait for a rainy day. fast forward a few days later it starts raining. in my infinite genius i decide to record my foolishness, i may have also had a beer, or three. now its poring down raining and i'm out there shaking it like its going out of style wondering what will hit me first, sobriety or a cold. when the rain stops. a few minutes later i'm just looking up at the cloudy sky just kinda looking stunned when the clouds start swirling. so im just sitting there when i notice the wind start picking up and im just thinking no way. but then it REALLY started picking up and i dashed into my house. the wind lasted a good hour and absolutely wrecked my backyard. when i looked at the news later that today apparently a land hurricane has spontaneously formed over my house. i suppose what im trying to say diary is that ill try to use my newfound superpowers responsibly and that rain dances are no joke.",,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11A8AQ11Y
