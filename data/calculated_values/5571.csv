I still can’t believe it at times that this happened. She was so healthy before this, no warning signs, no symptoms.. it was shocking to everyone.  I found her in her room one day after school. She was on the ground and having trouble speaking. I called 911 and they arrived quickly. I’m not sure if she would’ve made it if they hadn’t. She spent 3 weeks in the hospital. It was a really rough time for us both. I stayed with her almost every night. I was really scared, and couldn’t leave her side.   I’m happy to say, she’s doing much better now. She is back to living on her own. She’s taking physical therapy for some of the movement she lost in her arm, but otherwise she’s good as new. She survived! I am still scared that this could happen again. I’ve been helping her stay active and eating well, hopefully I’ll never have to go through this again.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAVQ3U47
