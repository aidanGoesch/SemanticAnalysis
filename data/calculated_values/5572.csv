A few months ago I got a call from my brother (my family still lives abroad). He told me that my mom was in the hospital, not to worry, but she had a stroke. At first, I didn't realize the seriousness of the situation. I asked him if she was okay, he told me he didn't know. Over the course of the next few days, I found out my mom had had a serious stroke and was in intensive care. This was very difficult for me being so far away, knowing there was nothing I could do to help. A few days went by with me trying to find out as much as I can but getting very little information from my family. It turned out I had the same amount of information as them, which was very little. My mom underwent surgery and was placed under anesthetic until the doctors felt she had stabilized. They then announced that they were going to wake her up. None of realized that the process of waking her up would take two weeks, so this was a very tense time wondering if she was going to be okay once she was awake. When she eventually woke up she didn't remember much of anything or anyone. Since then she has been going through a lot of therapy, both physical and psychological. I have spoken to her a few times during her recovery, but she never seemed to completely be sure of who I was. Last week I called my mom to see how she was feeling. When she answered, I could immediately tell things were better as she immediately called me by my name. She knew exactly who I was and spoke to me like nothing had happened. This was amazing and very emotional. I was so happy she is finally on the road to being fully recovered from the stroke and that we can finally say she made it.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAVQ3U47
