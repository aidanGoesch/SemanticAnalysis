Because my friend said her experience after visiting there. Nearly eight months ago I started to make plans to visit. I discussed with my friends about this plan to get an idea. They suggested me some online websites for vacation packages. I too compared different plans of different websites and finally chose one. The package included 6-night stay. I booked in that site. Finally the day arrived which was 3 months ago. I reached Universal Studios in Florida which was really exciting to me. I visited the Volcano Bay water park, Universal Studios and Adventure island. I rode the Incredible Hulk roller coaster which really surprised me and made fear in me, but it was an wonderful experience. I also ate at some nice restaurants including NBC Sports Bar and Grill. The food were simply tasty. Overall those 6 days were very exciting and I can't forget those days in my life.",,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9KH0QCV
