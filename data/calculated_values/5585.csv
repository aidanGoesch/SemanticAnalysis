The case then opened up, causing the two earbuds to fall out. The problem with this, was that the earbuds then became lost in the grassy field I was walking through. I was searching everywhere for them but could not find them. I was on my hands and knees searching but was not finding success. I was beginning to panic as these had cost me a good amount of money and I didn't have the extra cash to buy a new pair. Then, a student that I recognized from one of my classes walked up and asked what I was looking for. I told him my predicament and he was very sympathetic and offered to help. He then got down on his hands and knees and helped me search. After a good 15 minutes, he finds them and I immediately was at ease. I was so grateful for his help. He had no reason to help me but took time out of his day to assist me even though we had never eve  spoken before. It inspired me to ask others if they need help if it appears they are panicking over something. I'll never forget his generosity. All of us should aspire to help others the way he did.",,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9KI7CQQ
