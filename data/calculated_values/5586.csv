Once again, I am minding my own business browsing on the internet when all of a sudden Mike starts hollering in the kitchen.  This all happens last night.  He claims someone drank his six pack of Shiner Bock out of the fridge.  Of course I did not do it.  Scott is saying the same thing.  He has no idea what happened to Mike's beer.  All I know is that I did not drink his damn beer.  I don't even like that brand anyway.  It is overrated.  So, we all start yelling.  I have no idea if Mike just forgot he drank his beer or if Scott really did take it.  Next thing I know, we are in a shoving match, and Mike actually punches me in the eye!  Of course the landlord does not give a damn as long as we pay the rent, and the police dont care either.  I cant break the lease, nor do I have enough money to go someplace else, find new roommates, and leave these two ass clowns with each other.  It is another two months on the lease and a race against time.  Hopefully, we can stay out of each others faces just long enough to go our separate ways.  You just cant be too careful when choosing roommates.  I might have to get a lock for the bedroom door and hope Mike remembers when he drinks his damn beer.  He gets real mean when he is drunk.  Of course, you dont figure this out until you have a signed a lease.  Scott is OK, but he is kind of just there.  There are a couple of people I know who might make good roommates when this is over.  They are not so much into beer like Mike is and can actually remember what they did last night.  I wish I could get a raise so it would not even be necessary to have roommates.",,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9KNBQCI
