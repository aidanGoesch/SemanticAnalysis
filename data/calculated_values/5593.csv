I really wanted to try to make things work out for the best. I have got to get out of this mood. But she is always calling. Or posting something on Facebook. I hurt so bad. I think I will stop going on Facebook. Maybe I should change my number.  Maybe I will hangout with some friends that aren't married. I can't understand what happened. I am miserable. I should go on a trip to Bahamas.  I would sure like to get to know someone. That should take my mind off of things. I just want to feel better. I want to cry sometimes. Living without her is going to be tough. But I will keep on telling myself that I will be ok.,,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862MOF9SH
