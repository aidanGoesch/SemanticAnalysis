My best friend's father found out his cancer was in remission after a long several year battle with a horrible cancer known as Glioblastoma. I was overjoyed, as this family has been almost like a second family to me and have seen me through the good times and bad. His father even offered me a place to stay when things were looking rough at my home life. When I had first heard the news of his cancer announcement I was in a tough emotional state as the chances of surviving this cancer can be low and the surgery that has to be performed on the brain is long and difficult. I just remember seeing him post surgery, post chemo and everything and just not seeing the man I grew up knowing. He lost most motor abilities and the ability to speak. The recovery took 3 years and still to this day he is just gaining back the ability to speak coherent partial sentences, enough for us to understand him. Now with the cancer in remission I feel relief, joy, and some angst as the doctors say the woods are still yet to be cleared but for now everything seems to be moving along well. Part of me knew he would be tough enough to fight through this as he is already capable of driving on his own, which came to much shock to the doctors as that is a rare recovery component so early into rehab. This is part of the reason why I have hope for his recovery because this man battled adversity his whole life to become who he is today and to lose all of that in a matter of weeks was certainly heartbreaking. As I reflect on this recovery I am constantly overfilled with emotions as I keep rethinking the situation over in my head. I feel I am being pulled in every direction as I am unsure how to entirely handle the recent news of the remission. My friend seems to be feeling the same as me and I try to show my emotions on my sleeve in front of him and provide needed solace. All we can do is wait and hope the cancer continues to diminish as the odds of this case of cancer reappearing are still high. I have high hopes that within the next year or two I will be celebrating with him as he continues to live his life to the fullest and now be brought down by this disease.",,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862WMX9S5
