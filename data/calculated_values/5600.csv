We had run out of toilet paper so I asked my mom, who I am living with at the time, to watch my daughter while I went quickly to the store. I walked over and thinking back I should have just gone in my car instead of walking around by myself at night but we live and we learn. Well, I got to the store and wandered around a bit since I was already there. I ended up buying more than I anticipated. One of the baggers offered to walk me over to the stop sign but I politely refused, I regret this now. I should have accepted, I should have done so many things. About a few minutes before arriving to the apartment I saw my ex husband. I thought it was strange since we haven't seen each other in a while. I asked him what he was doing here and he said he wanted to see our daughter. I asked him why he didn't call first and he seemed upset that I even asked. He then asked me if I wanted to go take a ride an I refused. I told him I didn't want to go any where with him any more. He ended up forcing me in his car and having his way with me. It was the most horrible thing I had ever experienced. I ended up calling the police and they took me to a hospital. I won't ever walk alone at night.",,3TY7ZAOG5G6HVY297697KBEZ17B0KF
