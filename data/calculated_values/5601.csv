My ex husband and I divorced due to infidelity, physical & emotional abuse and drug usage when visiting our newborn while separated. I was raped within this marriage as well. It took me a while to realize it and I thank my past therapist for opening my eyes, marital rape does exist. I developed PTSD mostly as a result of this relationship. We got divorced and he lived with his girlfriend and their daughter. After the divorce was finalized things were alright for a while. We learned to co-parent without issue. He paid the child support and visited his son on the designated days. Fast forward to last month, our son was crying because he didn't want to leave me when I was dropping him off at his dads. I came inside and sat with our son on the couch. He was eventually calm and started to play with his toys. His father started to explain that his girlfriend moved out because they broke up. After a while our son went to his room and my ex-husband, completely unexpectedly, laid down on the couch next to me and hugged my waist then laid his head on my lap. I was immediately uncomfortable. Our son came back in the living room and was asking why daddy is hugging mommy. I said I don't know. Our son turned around and continued to play. His father then put a blanket over his head and tried to touch me in between my legs. I was frozen but angry. I felt a familiar feeling of disgust and rage. I told him to stop, and he did. I left quickly afterwards.",,3TY7ZAOG5G6HVY297697KBEZ17B0KF
