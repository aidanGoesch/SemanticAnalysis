I remember helping with the setting up. The bachelor was my friend and he invited me to be a groomsman and I accepted. I ended up finding a DJ for their wedding. Other people did their colors and theme. They wanted a pretty big and elaborate wedding. They definitely got it. I remember the wedding being pretty big as we had a couple hundred people attend. It was a pretty fun wedding. The bachelor party was better in my opinion. I won't get into that though. It got me thinking about the future between my girlfriend and I. Where were we going? I wasn't sure how to answer that and over three months later I still don't. I think we need more time to develop our relationship after sitting down with her. I just don't think we're ready.,3TY7ZAOG5G6HVY297697KBEZSFAK05,
