I asked him out and I really felt bad because really I didn't like him at all just his style of clothing. He really liked me and he was even falling in love with me so I never told him I didn't truly like him. We started dating for a long time but behind his back I was seeing other men and I still felt terrible but never told him. He was into me so much he asked my dad if he could marry me wants we graduated. My dad didn't know I didn't really like him so my dad told him of course because he was a hard working great guy. I really needed to tell him that we could be friends but he wasn't the guy for me. I decided to tell him the next time we went out together just me and him I didn't want to embarrass him. One day we got in the car together and went to the movies we both love the movies I didn't know it was the day he planed on proposing to me. I told him that we needed to talk and he said that he needed to talk to and he had something special for me. So I asked him if I could go first and he said that would be great he was always sweet. So I told him that i loved him and he was a great guy but that I thought we could only be friends. He was so sweet he said he loved me to and he was wanting to marry me but he totally understand and thought that would be great that would could be friends and never loss touch. Months went by and I found out that he was going to marry me the same day I appalled to him and he was alright he actually found someone else. Me and him now are married to different people but are still the best est friends.,,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU02UNLZ9
