I met him through Tinder and from what I could see from his profile pictures, we seemed to be very different.  But I thought he was good looking so I swiped right, and it turns out he had swiped right on me too.  When he started messaging me I was surprised to see how much we really had in common.  We both play a lot of instruments and had similar conversation style, and he was very intelligent.  When I showed up to meet him for the first time, he was dressed in dress khakis and very clean cut.  I am more of a black nail polish and flannels type of girl.  He has a job as a financial analyst and I am a freelancer.  When I started talking to him it turns out we have the same views about spirituality, had very similar childhoods, had the same passions and interests all around.  I really learned I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.  I was wrong in my assumption of his personality based on his style of dress.  I brought that up and he mentioned that he has had to adapt to being clean cut for his job.  We had a really good time and I have seen him since.  It was really nice to find someone that I am so in-tune with and I hope it works out.  If it doesn't work out, I have learned a very valuable lesson to take with me going forward.",3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU02UNLZ9,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU02UNLZ9
