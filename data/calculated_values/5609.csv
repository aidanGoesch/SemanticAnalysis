I was approved to become a U.S. resident.  My mother shared this with me while I was at work. A friend of mine saw my elation. They came over and asked what's are you so excited about? I shared with him the great news. He too was very happy for me. I was so overcome with emotion that I started to cry. Now I can be a proud American citizen. I can vote. I can be part of a better Country that I will help make better. I will vote for the better politicians. I will now have a say in what this country does. I""m very proud and happy I get to enjoy life.",,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU08A8ZLA
