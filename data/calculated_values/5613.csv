I supervised a staff of 6 associates. In the first week of May, our company let us know that they will be shutting our department down and we will all be losing our jobs. The next couple months were stressful and sad for us. On one hand, there was the fear of not being able to find a job after our end date materialized. On the other hand, we had all worked with each other for over a decade and knew that our time together was coming to an end. These past few months will definitely leave a mark on my life. The emotional roller coaster I felt on a daily basis is something I have never experienced before. One day I would feel confident and think that my life was meant to take this turn. The very next day I would feel defeated and incompetent with unreasonable expectations for myself. I would come into work as our end date approached and feel sad every time I had a laugh or a meaningful conversation with a colleague. It would make me feel awful that I would not be seeing these people again. Unfortunately, it also showed me that some people who you think are very close to you are really not honest people in your life who care for you the way you care for them. I saw this in my manager. She did not bother to speak to a single one of us in the last month we were employed. Not so much as a ""goodbye"" or ""good job"" or simply ""nice knowing you"". it really hurt me that she would treat the staff that way. I expected more from her. All in all, it was a humbling experience. I try to look forward on my new life now.",3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU09XRLZQ,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU09XRLZQ
