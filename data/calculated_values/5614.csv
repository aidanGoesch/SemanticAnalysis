She knows me so well. She knew that I had wanted to buy this guitar for over a year now. She also knew that I would never spend that kind of money on something just for me. I thought it was a silly purchase though since I don't know how to play. It has always just been a dream of mine. I was so grateful and excited that I made her come to the music store with me the very same day. When we walked into the store my eye immediately went to where I knew the guitar was on the wall. It was so beautiful. It was a dark creamy brown with a thin vine like pattern on the neck. I asked the sales person to get it down for me, because I could't reach it. She handed it to me and it felt better than I had imagined. My friend and I went over to sit down by the back wall and I strummed it for a bit before making the final decision to purchase my dream guitar. I purchased the guitar and actually signed up at the store for lessons since I had such a wonderful time there. I realized that night while just staring at the guitar in my room that sometimes the simplest things can be the most beautiful.",,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU0A2YZLM
