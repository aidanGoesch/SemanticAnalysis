Me and my friend were being told to stay out of dark alley ways because of dangers and what not. At the time there was a lot of protests going on so some times you could hear them in the distance. So we were walking and heard all this music, singing, and yelling coming through this alley. First I was a little frightened but felt no bad vibes. So we ended up following it all the way through and came out between this old apartment building and the metro. All the music was coming from the building and a window was open so we decided to throw some rocks through the window to ask to come up. Thinking back on it that could of been bad but worked out good. A guy looked out the window with a handlebar mustache and said some thing in Greek. Then he gave us a smile and said ""Oh Americans! yes, yes come up my friends."" When we get in there all the rooms of this apartment building were converted into recording studios with all different bands playing. We ended up hanging out there for about 2 hours. The music was low key and soft. I enjoyed my time in that dark alley more than the entire trip. We didn't understand them to well and they also didn't understand us but we all knew the music so it worked out. It was such a good time.",3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UG36W0Z,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UG36W0Z
