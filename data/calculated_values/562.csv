The way that we ended things the first time was a bit....off, I supposed. You see, I started smoking marijuana when I met this girl. I was about 19 years old, she around 24. I was a Criminal Justice student and pretty straight-laced, unbeknownst to me she was a struggling drug addict that was trying to turn her life around. We started smoking weed together. I like it a lot more now, but back then I wasn't too crazy about it. I just wanted to impress her and seem cool, because at the time I definitely felt like a kid in the relationship. Shortly after I started smoking with her, I started selling as well. She was one of my best and worst customers. I didn't have a lot of money at the time so I couldn't just give her free weed, but I'd sell to her either at my cost or taking a slight loss. I just couldn't keep up with her demand. That girl smoked A LOT. Eventually it got to the point where I had realized she was really just using me for the drugs, and I started to get extremely impatient about the money she owed me (again, keep in mind I was already selling to her at an amazing price because I liked her). Eventually this lead to me banging at her door at 3 A M trying to figure out just where the heck my money was. Her dad answered, and she wasn't too happy about that at all. I made up a BS story about being strung out on crack and wound up getting the money just a few days later. Crazy times. And to think we'd be back together all of these years later...",,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AXSO11L
