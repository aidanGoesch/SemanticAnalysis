I was heart broken as i wasn't visited by any of of my family members. But without telling about it to my mom i let her continue with her business trip. i started to continue the day with my regular routine but when i went to cook i got to know that refrigerator is empty. I went shopping that afternoon to get some kitchen provisions. After shopping i went to meet one friend of mine and was telling her how hurt i was because my mom couldn't visit me even after inviting her neither my other family members come for  visit. Later i headed back home while on the way i grabbed some snacks for me to have it when i am watching movie. I went back to my apartment feeling lonely. When i was on the couch watching a old movie i realized how boring a holiday could be. I was to about to sleep on the couch when i suddenly heard someone knocking my door. I thought its my friend who have come to stay and comfort me since i told her how i felt. I opened the door to get the surprise of my life. My mom, father and brother all shouted surprise. I would have fainted to the joy seeing my entire family coming to visit me. I would never forget that day in my life.",,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZ20W1
