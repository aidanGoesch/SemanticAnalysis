I'm 45 years old and I'm going back to school.  I've been a hair stylist for 25 years and never pursued my dream of becoming a doctor.  Well now my kids are grown and I have the chance to better myself.  Today is my first day of Biology 101 and I am going to rock it.  Everybody tells me it's too late, and I know it will be a lot of work, but I've balanced more before.  I've raised two kids while working full time without any support from a man. I've taken all the prereqs at the community college to get ready and it has been work but I know I can do it.  I will be so glad to walk across the stage and get my diploma and even more to see the words ""Medical Doctor"" next to my name.  I am not turning back till I achieve my goal.  I can do this.  My kids will be so proud. I want to show them what can be done if you just put your mind to it.  Day 1 starts now.  Let's begin.",,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZN0WM
