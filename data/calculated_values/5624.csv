I decided I wanted to change careers and needed to advance me education. It was a little nerve wracking to apply for college again. Getting all the paperwork and transcripts together is a tedious process. The staff at the school I wanted to attend was very helpful and made the process as easy as possible. They seemed happy to help and enthusiastic on my behalf. When I started classes  I quickly got into the swing of things and started enjoying my studies.   My teachers were helpful. I was not used to the amount of computer work but with their help I caught up to the younger students very quickly. Once I got into the swing of things the experience really took off. I enjoyed the assignments and really felt like I was doing something good for myself. I started looking forward to the next class I would take. It seemed like finishing my degree was a feasible goal for the first time in years. It was not easy to balance the school work with all my other responsibilities but it was the start of a very satisfying experience.  I feel good about my future and I know I made the right decision.,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZN0WM,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZN0WM
