I was extremely excited as I didn't know they were coming. I took this time to get to know my grandson more. I surprised them both with a trip to Knott's Berry Farm. My grandson loved it so much. My son enjoyed seeing us play together and have a great time. The day came with they had to leave. I was extremely sad about that. I didn't want them to go. I wanted them to move in with me forever. I know that this wouldn't happen so I move on. I had a tear in my eye as they walked away. My grandson comes running up to me and says, ""grandma, I had a super great time with you and I can't wait to come back"". That was the best thing i've heard in quite a long time. I love my kids!",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ4ONRN9
