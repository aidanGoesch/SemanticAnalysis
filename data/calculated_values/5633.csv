I noticed the woman alone standing in the museum and approached her. I started a conversation mentioning what a nice museum it was. She noded, said yes and smiled. I moved away to look at a nearby painting. I could not help but see her continue to stare at the one painting. She looked sad. I went back over to her and said, this painting is very lovely. It was then I got the surprise of the day when she told me the painter was her granddaughter and that she had died two months ago in a car accident. I was shocked and moved as I did not have a relative but a friend and co-worker who had died and it was after his death that I started going back to read his articles. He was a newspaper sports reporter. I could feel the women's agony and pride as I stood there next to her. It was as if the person was there again, just like for me. The time spent standing quietly next to this woman, gave me closure and a bond. I left happy to know she and I shared the chance to relieve the life of someone special to us, not just in memories, but in something tangible they had created.",3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ5B6NRZ,
