I did not know if I would enjoy it, I had never done it before. I thought how bad could it be? Being one with nature, enjoying the cool breeze and hiking around wherever we end up. I spent about an hour driving to the camp site, even the drive was fun. I was happy at this point and looked forward to the camp to come. I arrived and set up my tent, this was really difficult and I was already getting frustrated. I could tell that I might not enjoy this after all. I looked to the left and saw a mouse. The mouse was odd looking, I wasn't sure what was wrong with it but I was a little creeped out. It started circling me and I was really regretting doing any of this. I wanted to just leave, but the mouse had me trapped! I threw a rock at it and grabbed all my things and ran back to the car. I got in the car and wondered what the hell just happened. I started the car and drove home, never again.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQF7ARN9
