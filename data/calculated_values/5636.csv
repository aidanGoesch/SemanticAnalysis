When I finally got there with my friends for a weekend camping trip I decided to take a short walk around the surrounding campsite. It was a breath of fresh air that I took in as I don't usually get exposed to nature where I'm from. I didn't walk that far away when I suddenly heard some noise coming from the floors of the creek I was approaching. Leaves seem to be rattling and I can tell something was lurking underneath. I wondered what it could've been and decided that it was probably nothing to worry about. But I also too scared to walk further without my friends to accompany me. So I decided to stay there and wait for them to come get me; I should've mentioned that I told them I was walking to the creek. I sat on a giant slab of rock, covered with fern. It was cold and smelled like fresh cut grass. Then I starting to hear rattling again, very sharp and quick swipes of sounds coming from the fallen dried leaves on the ground. I picked up a small tree branch, a skinny dried out stick and poked around the leaves. It didn't take me very long to identify the area where the mysterious ruckus was coming from. I toppled some of the leaves from this particular area and saw a little mouse! I got scared, to be honest. Immediately, I threw the stick at it but it just ran away. I remember that it wasn't just a regular mouse but one with creepy big bulging eyes. Later my friends told me that it was probably something called a muskrat. The incident with mother nature got me thinking that maybe I'm not cut out for the outdoors after all. But the rest of the trip was nice, as I stayed mostly in the tent the entire time.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQF7ARN9
