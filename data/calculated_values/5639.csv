In a way, it was a form of catharsis that I didn't really know that I needed. I was working long and hard to improve on my thinking and leadership skills, but just could never crack or edge on through. My birthday took place on the day my mom wanted me and my husband to go with her to do an Escape Room. It was challenging, and exhausting, but we made some pretty substantial progress. There were so many different mechanisms involved that it was hard to imagine there was actually a way out. But I was excited, and I could tell my family was excited too. We had worked hard to make progress, and while it was slow, it was still progress. It was my first ever try at one of these rooms. I had only heard of them in passing but had never seriously looked into them. After that night though, I want to go more. It's an exhilarating way to pass the time and to have fun doing something a little bit different. It's hard to deal with certain things. Some things just felt counter-intuitive. We ultimately didn't make it to completion that night, but I'm confident I can do it if I had just a little more time.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQXEZRNU
