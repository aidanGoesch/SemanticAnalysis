I was hired in November and you had six months to complete the course so my deadline was less than a month away. Your boss or someone else is supposed to help you but I was on my own. There was no study book or no specific time set aside for me. Anyways, I had to do this course in work flow and a lot of was very technical. I was getting frustrated. I was one course away from finishing the first section of 2 and i could not pass the quiz for the life of me. You get three attempts before the boss has to ask for the course to be reset. I had to use that twice. With 10 days to go and my boss going on vacation I had to ask to come in on a Saturday to do the course. First thing was that daunting course. I passed it right away with a little bit of my bosses help. It ended up taking me all of that Saturday when i was expecting about an hour or so. It was now off to the final. I passed it first try and got that monkey off my back. I can get nationally certified if Id like but I am firmly established with my new company.",3U4J9857OFXUK6YZMSHN0N5WD4WB7B,3U4J9857OFXUK6YZMSHN0N5WD4WB7B
