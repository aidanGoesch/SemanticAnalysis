This story captures the awe-inspiring island of Chilo√©, Chile in a nutshell. Speaking to a small first day hike we took that culminated in walking among penguins and feeling quite proud of the accomplishment. it was a memorable experience that i would never forget. that trip fixed my marriage and i was glad i made that trip.",,3U4J9857OFXUK6YZMSHN0N5WOCLB7R
