I was picked up by an old friend who escorted me to an island he's been living on called Chiloé. A two hour car-ride and some conversation and we'd crossed the ferry, seeing sea lions swimming alongside us as we walked off the boat. We drove to the hostel he and his girlfriend had opened, I'd be rooming there for three nights. Right away I felt the whole weight of the world taken off my shoulders. No internet, no cell phones, no hustle and bustle of city streets. Nature was everyplace and I was joined by two other travelers, my friend and his girlfriend as they cooked dinner for the group. We sat around a large table and shared a meal and some local beer and talked about our plans for the following days. On awakening at 6 AM I smelled a pot of coffee that was brewing from a kettle on the stove. We all shuffled to the kitchen still half-asleep. We had coffee and some toast and piled into a van that would take us on our very first Chiloé adventure. We crossed the river in a boat manned by Octavio, a local craftsman and part-time tour fixer. When we arrived on the island I had no clue what to expect from our hike. The start of the path was filled with trees and I couldn't see far beyond them. We all got off the boat and began our trek together, a humble group of four. As we rounded a corner and climbed a small hill...the otherside was otherworldly. Green and lush plantlife framed the ocean with waves crashing up onto the sandy beaches, wild horses roaming around and the site of an old shipwreck washed to shore was visable. The sun was breaking through the clouds and it was perhaps the most incredible vista I've been privy to my whole life. The air was fresh and cool and we all stopped for a moment to really take it all in. The hike would continue along the beach and then into a forest preserve, mud, old outposts and finally back onto the beach as we awaited our dangerous trek through wasit-high waters that were a bit volatile to get to the portion of the island that housed a colony of penguins. I had to sign a waver and slowly traverse a half-raging sea but the end result was a dream come true. To walk among the penguins. No camera, no cell phone to capture the moment I was razor-focused on preserving it in my memory. That trip was one I will never, ever forget. The new friendships formed, the fresh seafood enjoyed from boats just back from sea, the guitar playing around the living quarters of the hostel, the local beer to be had and most importantly the nature of Chiloé that brought me back from the insanity of city life...back to nature.",,3U4J9857OFXUK6YZMSHN0N5WOCLB7R
