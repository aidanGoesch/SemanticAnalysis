Lake Charles is renowned for its premier hiking, climbing, and  mountain biking trails. In the summer, it is a refreshing spot to swim and play water sports. This summer we took the R.V. up to our favorite spot by the lake. Joining me for the trip was my wife, my two kids, and my six grandchildren. It was a really tight squeeze driving there. After we set up the campsite and put up the tents, we decided to go swimming in the lake. It was a fun day with the family and we celebrated with hotdogs and hamburgers for dinner. Later at night, we roasted marsh-mellows and made s'mores. The next day we woke up early and decided to go for a hike around the lake. When noon came along, it started to get pretty hot. I found my self overheating and I needed a little rest. My family brought over cold rags to place on my head in order to cool me down. It really helped! Rather than wanting to continue the hike, my grandson sort of saved the day when he saw me get tired and came over to sit with me. I can't believe the trip was two weeks ago.",,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AZEL11S
