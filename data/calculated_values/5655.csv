I went first to the UK but that was just a layover. I was leaving the US to move to Morocco so that I could meet a man I had met online and get to know him with the intent of working together and starting a relationship. This was so important to me because I was starting a new life. I remember getting off the plane. The Agadir airport is so small. I think only about 6 people work there. 2 immigration people, 1 customs person, 2 guys on baggage and 1 information person. I mean it's one of the smallest airports I have ever seen that accept international flights. It's so small they don't even charge you for a baggage cart. I remember getting my bags and heading out the door. I could see A from the foyer. It was the first time I have seen him in person. I was so terrified that he might not like me. I almost went back inside. However I walked outside and met him and it was amazing. Now I have been here for 2 months and I have never been happier.",,3U5NZHP4LSOTHP5LI6L0MKZFIITPHM
