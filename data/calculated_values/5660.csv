I was living in Michigan so we established a long-distance relationship. We had known each other since 2001, and had been romantic partners for about a total of 10 years, but had not seen one another for about four years before we decided to reconcile. When we reconciled, we specifically agreed to see one another exclusively. I went to visit her in Los Angeles about seven times during the long-distance relationship for a total of about 3 months. She also visited me in Detroit. In February of this year, I went to visit her for about a week around Valentines Day.  On one of the days I was with her, I mentioned to her something indicating that we were in an exclusive relationship. To my complete and utter surprise, she looked confused by my statement. She asked me, ""did we agree to that?"" I reminded her specifically of how and when we had agreed about it. The point here is that her reaction clearly showed me that she was not dating me exclusively. After discussing it with her for several minutes, she unconvincingly tried to backtrack and deny that there was anything for me even concern myself about. However, as I looked back at our relationship, it became clear to me that she had been seeing other guys while she was supposed to be exclusively with me. During the entire 17 years or so that I have known her, I was aware that she had challenges telling the truth. Her instant reaction to anyone who questioned her about something would usually be to provide a deceptive answer. She would often reveal to me the habitual lies that she would routinely tell other people and would even occasionally ask for my advice on a convincing lie to tell someone. I usually told her it was better to just tell the truth. Most of the time that I was with her, I naively believed that I was the only person that she was not lying to. But suddenly, I had discovered that I was also just another one of the many people that she routinely deceived. I carefully reexamined the prior year during our long-distance relationship and looked at it with skepticism about whether the things that she told me were truthful.  I noticed that many of the things that never really made sense to me, actually made sense when I assumed that she was lying and cheating on me. It was a painful revelation to me to discover that someone that I loved and completely trusted was constantly deceiving me and being unfaithful to me. As a result of my long-distance girlfriend's inadvertent revelation and my own soul-searching about the depths of her deception, I ended my relationship with her and discontinued all contact with her. It has been a very painful lesson to me about trusting the wrong person too much. I assumed that she would never want to hurt me in the same way that I would never want to hurt her.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPDNB4Z9,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPDNB4Z9
