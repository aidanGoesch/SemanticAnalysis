How could I?  Even though I was born 27 years ago I was really born on that day.  All of my childhood and young adult years feel like such a blur now.  Such a waste.  Not that I didn't have fun experiences and all.  I did.  I have had many and many good friends and times out of fun.  But through all of those years, I had never known truly what I was here for.  For Jehovah.  I never even knew his name, can you believe it?  The creator of the universe and all that we see about us, and I never once stopped to think of him.  Now, he is all I think about.  My daily scripture readings have opened my eyes for the first time in my life.  I now see the meaning behind everything people do and my life has become more fulfilling where once it was empty.  How could I have been so blind before?  No matter, scripture teaches us to look forward and become better, not dwell in the past.  And so I do that, every day, rising to meet Jehovah and thinking of him when I go to bed.  My life is full now.  I can die happy.  For I have Jehovah in my corner.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPE0TZ4D
