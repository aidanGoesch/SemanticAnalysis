I celebrated it with a party with my friends. At the baptism, everyone kept congratulating and told me I had made one of the best decisions of my life. During the baptism, one would be dipped into water and that dipping into water signifies that one is dead to his past way of life. When I came out of the water, it signified that from that day henceforth, I was dedicating my life to serve Jehovah and to be obedient to him no matter what he asks of me. The baptism was not a hurried decision. I had been studying with Jehovah's Witnesses for more than two years before I decided that I wanted to get baptized. I had learned much about Jehovah, his word the Bible, and what it means to be a christian from Jehovah's Witnesses. When I decided to get baptized, the brother studying with me was very happy but I was happier. On the day of my baptism, I called all my friends to witness the event. My family also came to the Assembly hall. I must say that it was a very memorable day for me. I was very happy that day. I took lots of pictures and selfies so that the memory would remain with me for a very long time. That Saturday in April is one that I will never forget in a hurry. I must say that this is not my first time to undergo any baptism. But this baptism was the first where I was getting baptized with the full consciousness of what the symbolism involved and where I had the freedom to choose to do so. I love Jehovah and decided to serve him that is why I got baptized that day.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPE0TZ4D,
