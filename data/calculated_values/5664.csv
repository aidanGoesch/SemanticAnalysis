Which I was skeptical about before attending and I can honestly say I had a really positive experience and met great people. The sound was amazing at every stage, thicc heavy bass. The staff Did a really good job of making sure everyone got water and had everything we needed. Even cops were walking around the venue but they seemed very friendly and welcoming. The weather was pretty hot. It was humid, pretty much how it always is in August. There were vendors selling things like Art. That part of the festival didn't seem too crowded and it seemed like the vendors didn;t make out too well. Last but not least the lineup that performed was amazing. That was the best part about the festival and it's not usually like that. Overall I had an amazing time, with it being pretty close to me I might go again if the lineup is good enough and I can get tickets for cheap again. Overall I had the time of my life. It was literally one of the best weekends I've experienced. I can't wait until I can go again.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPG884ZF
