It was in Orlando and it was my first time going to something like this. I wasn't going to go initially but I ended up getting the weekend off so I figured I had nothing to lose. We went up to Orlando the day before in order to get settled in and hang with some friends before the festival. The next day we went out and got all the essentials we would need for the day, namely alcohol. We had a few drinks in the hotel room and then took an Uber to the location of the festival. It was a pool party and everyone was dressed accordingly. I normally don't dance too much but after a few shots of vodka and a few beers I was a dancing machine. The weather was a bit gray and overcast but it was actually a blessing. Hundreds of people dancing and sweating wouldn't smell very good. We ended up dancing and partying until it started raining. When the rain came we decided we had enough and took an Uber to get something to eat. My age had caught up to me by that time and I realized how tired I was. I could barely hold my head up at the table but I was able to get through my meal. We then headed back to the room and slept like babies. All in all I had a really good time and I wouldn't mind going again.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPG884ZF,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPG884ZF
