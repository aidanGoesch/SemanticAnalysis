The life changing experience i had in Africa. the entire trip of self-discovery! It has been a long time dream for me, to visit africa. Afterall, it is where mankind began its journey. I finally got to it around april, 4 months ago. It was a short trip, just around a week long. However, it was magical. I got to see the wilderness and the beauty of it. The animals..wow! I still can't believe i was a couple feet away from a lion! It was wonderful, the entire safari. The locals were friendly. The food was quite delicious as well. I'm quite sure that i came back a changed man.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPMOC4ZL
