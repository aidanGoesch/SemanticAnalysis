We had a Brooks Family Reunion.  People came from many states.  We had the best time.  My mom has nine sisters and brothers.  They all came except one that had passed away.  We gave gifts to each sibling.  It was a photo collage book.  we also had a big birthday cake made for all the siblings and sung happy birthday.  we had a photographer there and we got great pictures.  we toasted champagne and ate great food.  My husband and I smoked the butts.  We had pulled pork sandwiches, cole slaw and lots of beer.  we huged each other and talked to all the cousins and kids that we all have now.    It was a good time had by all.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPOFIZ46,
