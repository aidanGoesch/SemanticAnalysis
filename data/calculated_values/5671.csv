I helped planned it for months and when it finally came the weekend I was so excited and anxious.  I wanted to make sure everything went off without a problem.  We had family coming in from all over the United States so we had prepare for alot.  Unfortunately it was hot as ever and we didn't get to use the tent and chairs we purchased.  We hung out inside most of the time.  I enjoyed hugging necks of cousins, Aunts, Uncles etc I haven't seen in years.  I was exhausted after it but enjoyed making memories.  We had it at my brothers and sister in laws so they had alot more to prepare than I did.  I did create a family album for the 9 brothers and sisters that was special to me.  We also had a huge birthday cake made for all the sisters and brothers.  They toasted champagne and blew out the candles because they are never together to celebrate each others birthday.  We had a photo area where everyone took family picutres and they uploaded them online.  We can go online and download them free of cost.  Everyone exchanged information to keep in touch.  It was such a good time had by all.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPOFIZ46,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPOFIZ46
