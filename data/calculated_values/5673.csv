The entire family was devastated. Mom took it the hardest though. It made the entire situation much worse for me, as i had to somehow find a way to keep mom going while having to deal with such an unexpected shock myself. Dad had been coughing for years now. We have all been telling him to get and consult a doctor for years. He was adamant. No surprise there, old military habits. He always smiled when we brought up the topic. There was so much confidence in that smile that we let it go. Perhaps i shouldn't have. Could i have changed the outcome if i had pushed for a diagnosis with dad back then? I don't know. How could i push dad! He has always been known to be strong and adamant.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPXCOZ4F
