It came on slowly at first. Fatigue, numbness, that general feeling of hopelessness when you constantly tell yourself that things would just be better if you'd make a list, a schedule, eat some vegetables, take up yoga. you know- drink the green tea.. If you'd just DO what needs to be done instead of procrastinating and enforcing the cycle of dread and overwhelm. It took me a couple months to believe that I wasn't suddenly just a useless, lazy waste of oxygen. That I needed someone who wasn't me to judge the situation. I had a hard time with the meds at first. There's a stigma. And therapy didn't magically fix me either. All my therapist could do was try and teach me coping methods and how to recognize the warning signs. Recognizing that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain didn't immediately cure me. It wasn't a waste of time but I still had a lot of work to do and it took time. Somewhere in there I decided I was worth the effort. Not every day is perfect but I've really been feeling back to myself the past couple months and it's amazing the difference. I wonder how I didn't notice how off kilter I was when I was in the trenches. It seems obvious to me, now,that I shouldn't feel the need to cry over an, admittedly, endless pile of dishes in the sink. I shouldn't feel defeated at the thought of taking a shower. I hope I never forget how I felt in that hard time, so I feel compassion and understanding for those struggling and can do my best to help others while remaining reasonable and unoffended when I am unable to ""fix"" them.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPXE7Z42
