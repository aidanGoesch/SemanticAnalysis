I've been working with a Blue-headed macaw for that past 4 months, hand raising him since he was only 5 weeks old.  He was the first BH Macaw we were ever able to hatch at my facility so he got some special treatment when he got into human care.  This little guy had free range of the building once he began flying.  It go to the point where we had to put him in the kitchen since he would get himself in to some pretty high up spots where we couldn't reach him.  So after Azul began flying, we decided it was time to start training him.  Let's just say that at the beginning he was not a fan of his restricted time.  In order to work with him we needed him first to learn to step up onto our hand on cue.  So he didn't get the spoiled treatment of being allowed to fly when he wanted in our kitchen.  The first few days, he would try to bite our hands when ever we put it near him.  So Azul would then get to fly around without stepping on our hand first, as we'd pull our hand out of the cage and he'd take that opportunity to gain his freedom.  Eventually though through mostly my effort, and a little diet modification, I got Azul to accept my hand being near his perch without him biting me.  Then I began to teach him how to lift up his foot so he can signal to us he is interested in coming out.  Every a few more days of this work he finally began to put a foot on my hand, not without trying to bite me right after, but baby steps.  After we got over this phase of biting, we reached the point when he would place his feet on my hand and receive a nice little treat for doing that.  Then he got his chance to fly around the kitchen in all its freedom for a few hours until we needed him to go back.  With lots of hard work Azul learned that he could get what he wanted by stepping out nicely and not trying to knaw on the hand that feeds him.",3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ820IQ0O,
