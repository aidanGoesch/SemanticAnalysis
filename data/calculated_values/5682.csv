I want to get as much as I can get checked out, as far as my inner health of my body is concerned. A blood test. A urine sample. Checking my eyes. Checking my ears. Checking my blood pressure. Checking my cholesterol level. There's other things that I get checked as well . Once they are done, I get the results a week or so later. From there, everything is reviewed. What was within range, what wasn't. Do I need to make adjustments, things like that. It's the least I can do. I'm not a doctor, so I go to the experts.
