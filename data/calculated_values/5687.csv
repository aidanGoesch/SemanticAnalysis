I was very excited to finally take a step to the future. I have been with my husband for almost 10 years so getting married was a full circle of our relationship. Even though we haven't been married long I feel like we will have a long and successful life. We are currently trying to have a baby and expand our family. We have 2 dogs but we also would like to have 2 kids. We have also since remodeled our house I kinda feel that has put some stress on our relationship due to us both working full time and going to school and redoing a house all on our own. Its very hard and challenging but we step up together and keep pushing forward to complete each project and in the end we will be better off knowing we can be put through trying times and achieve our goals. We are looking forward to continuing building our life. We are very happy together. We are very patient with each other and we know how to interact with each other always. Our relationship isn't perfect. We do fight sometimes but we always move past it fast and continue back to happy times. I'm excited to see where life takes us.,3UJ1CZ6IZIBEEO1I9LOLSS100SSS55,
