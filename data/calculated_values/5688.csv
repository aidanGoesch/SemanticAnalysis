I have bought a house and a new car. I also received a new job where I almost doubled my pay so that helped a great deal. I also got married after being with my fianc√© for over 8 years so that was a great accomplishment. I have a very busy schedule I'm working 2 jobs plus doing my amazon surveys. I am also attending night school. My husband also works full time and goes to school as well. We are trying our best to be successful in life. We also try to have a date night once a week to  keep the relationship going in a positive direction. We also go on lots of vacations together from going to the beach to the mountains. We are continuing to grow together as a couple and are working on expanding our family. We currently have 2 dogs named jax and tucker. They are pit bull and chichuaua. We have had jax for 5 years and tucker for 3 years. We plan to try for a baby next.,3UJ1CZ6IZIBEEO1I9LOLSS100SSS55,3UJ1CZ6IZIBEEO1I9LOLSS100SSS55
