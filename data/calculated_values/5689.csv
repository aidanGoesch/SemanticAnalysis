They had a big party to celebrate that a great comma had been watching us with a project that the company would benefit greatly. Everyone was very happy and I could only see Teresa from human resources. She had taken A holiday in southern Greece and really looked more beautiful than normal. I wondered if she is admiring her beauty or was admiring the fact that she looked so relaxed and fresh and at that time I asked her to tell me about her vacation when that moment a companion arrived and fell and the champagne that he brought in the cup went to give the beautiful dress that the young woman brought. Immediately went to clean and I continued admiring its beauty in the distance. The next day some friends arrived with a money problem that to be honest do not understand something about bowling and I really ignored them, all the time I spent thinking about Teresa and her beautiful wine-colored dress. The truth is that I spent the next day thinking about her, what she would be doing where she was going and every time she had a chance. I talked to her but one day. unfortunately, she left work. got a better job offer and without hesitation she left. So now I only think if I will see her again one day. I hope it's like that. Maybe that day I can invite a coffee. Maybe now if he says we go to lunch and get to know you better.",,3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW45F5R5H
