This story starts out with a group of friends and myself trying to start a business. We wanted to open up a vintage store, mainly video games and collectible card and board games. So we needed about $50,000. We were working some pretty dead end jobs, just a bunch of college dropouts. Joseph get's the great idea that we join a intermediate bowling tournament. The top prize was $20,000. We were all apart of the bowling team at the high school we attended together. We knew we would never go pro but we were pretty good. So we sign up for this tournament. After a month of practice, the weekend of the tournament had arrived. We played 3 games on Saturday and beat all of our competitors but a smooth 50 or more points. We were now in the semi-finals and finals scheduled for Sunday. Perry hurt his thumb in our last game on Saturday but was able to keep it together and see us to the finals. Just before the finals one of the members of the other team had to drop out, so we won by default.",,3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW45F5R5H
