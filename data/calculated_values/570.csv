It was a hard one to take especially for my brother because he was the one who encouraged me to go on and trust the man. I really had a difficult time of preparing other certified documents and i almost lost hope. However,after few weeks,a case was reported in the near by town that another victim was conned. it created tension to the police as media reported to beware nationalities. I remember one day i was in the farm,i received a call from one of the officers who was handling the case. I rushed to the police station,at least i was relieved the conman was under police custody ,will not give fake promises to anyone again. The police confronted him to reveal whereabouts of my documents and how he has been operating. He begged like a little baby that it was not his fault and that what he did to me and other victims was as a result of poverty and need for cash to feed his family. He confirmed that  he threw the documents away as they had no use to him. I met with other victims who appeared to be fresh graduates like me. Police were able to get information on which technique he used as he was targeting graduates with no exposure to the corporate society. The conman was presented into a court of law and was sentenced for fifteen years. I was so happy at least the victim will be in prison for long after putting innocent people in such a tormenting experience. I learned that some people always find a way to manipulate less informed individual in the market. We should be very keen on the people we let in to our life.",33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQ2GLBHZ,
