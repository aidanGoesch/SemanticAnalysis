I wasn't really having any problems. I just thought it would be interesting to talk to a professional about some things I've wondered about during my lifetime. Money and time were not restricting me from going, and I knew if I didn't like it after the first visit I could just stop going. But as it turned out, I really liked the therapist and enjoyed talking to her. So I went back week after week and looked forward to it. We talked about all kinds of things, but the main issue I wanted to address was why I was never interested in having a boyfriend. In high school my friends always were excited about dating. Sometimes they would be ecstatically happy about their boyfriend and another time they would be terribly depressed about a break-up. At parties you would see couples pairing off and making out. Many times 'he kissed me' would be the main topic of conversation with my friends. But I never quite understood what the attraction was. I didn't have any desire for a boyfriend. I didn't even think sex sounded interesting or desirable. And still, to this day, I have not been interested in dating. I enjoy people. I love people. But I don't have an interest in finding 'love' like you see in the movies. Well, I was surprised and, I guess, even relieved when the therapist diagnosed me as 'asexual'. Maybe I shouldn't describe it as a diagnosis because it's not a disease. There is not anything 'wrong' with me. In fact, I'm kind of glad to be asexual. Apparently, it has saved me from a lot of pain in life!",,3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW4ON95RY
