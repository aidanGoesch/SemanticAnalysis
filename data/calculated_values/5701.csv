I've always wondered why I do not crave or want to ever have sex or do anything sexual with anyone. I did some research and found that there is a large spectrum of asexuality. I found one aspect of it that explained how I exactly feel. I am homoromantic. I've always known I was gay but I've wondered why I never have the desire to even date someone. What homoromantic basically means is that I am exclusively attracted to males but not attracted to sex. I've never really been interested in gaining affection from people. I don't even like being touched. I do not crave social interaction to make me feel good about myself. I do masturbate as much as most guys, I think, but I am happy with just that and don't need anyone else. The desire to masturbate is just to release the tension that guys feel after not ejaculating for awhile. I've never had the desire to be in a relationship or have children. I am perfectly fine knowing that I will be by myself for the rest of my life. I enjoy my own company and have many hobbies.",,3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW4ON95RY
