STILL FEELING NUMB I FIND MYSELF SITTING BACK AND WONDERING WILL I SEE YOU AGAIN I AM RELIGOUS BUT IN MOMENTS LIKE THIS IT ALL SEEMS SUREAL. I SEE HIS FACE AND EVEN SMELL HIS WEIRD LAUNDRY DETERGENT BUT WHEN I SIT IN A MOMENT OF SILENCE I REALIZE ITS ON;Y A WISHFUL THOUGHT.  I FELT GREAT LOSS WHEN MOM AND DAD DIED BUT THIS IS EVEN WORSE. THIS AWFUL TIME HAS MADE ME REALIZE SO MANY THINGS I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT OR EXCEPT. YOU KNOW WHEN YOU ARE LITTLE PEOPLE SAY LIFE PASSES QUICKLY BUT IT DOES'NT SINK IN. YOU THINK LIFE GOES ON FOREVER AND YOU WILL LIVE FOREVER BUT NOT SO. THIS MOMENT HAS REALLY SUNK IN THAT WE ALL DIE AND THEN THE PAIN BEGINS . LOSING MY BROTHER THAT COLD NOVEMBER MORNING WAS A GRIM REMINDER THAT ALL THE TIME WE HAVE IS RIGHT NOW AND WE MUST TELL OUR LOVED ONES THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT. THE REGRETS I HAVE FOR THIS LOSS ARE MORE THAN I THOUGHT I WOULD FEEL. NOT ONLY DID I LOOSE MY BROTHER AND FRIEND BUT WAS LEFT FULL OF REGRETS. I FEEL I SHOULD HAVE DONE MORE AND SAID MORE TO LET HIM KNOW HOW I FELT. I JUST THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A TOMORROW TO TELL HIM. I OFTEN FIND MYSELF LISTENING AT NIGHT TO SEE IF I HEAR HIS VOICE OR MAYBE EVEN SEE A GHOSTLY IMAGE. MY FAMILY THINKS I'M CRAZY LOOKING FOR GHOSTS. THEY SAY LET HIM REST IN PEACE AND YES I ALSO SAY BROTHER REST IN PEACE. THIS WILL ALWAYS AFFECT ME DEEPLY FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.,3UNH76FOCTR9IHYX0QXWRG0NUE7YMB,
