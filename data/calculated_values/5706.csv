HE WAS ONLY FIFTY-TWO.  I WAS DEVASTATING BECAUSE HE LIVED WITH ME AND WE WERE CLOSE. WE WOULD HAVE LONG TALKS EVERYDAY AND REMINISE ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS. HIS DEATH WAS A COMPLETE SHOCK TO ME AND EVERYONE. HE WAS AT HOME WITH ME AND JUST STOP BREATHING AND TRIED TO REVIVE HIM. BUT HE LEFT . I WAS DEVASTATED AND IN SCHOCK. I THOUGHT HOW CAN I MOVE ON NOW MY BEST FRIEND IS GONE AND THEN I REALIZED I WILL SEE HIM AGAIN. ONE DAY SOON WE WILL SIT AND TALK ABOUT THE GOOD OLD DAYS FREE OF PAIN AND REGRET. I CANT WAIT TO SEE HIM AGAIN AND TELL HIM HOW MUCH I HAVE MISSED HIM. I HAVE KEPT ALL OF HIS THINGS JUST AS THEY WERE WHEN HE WAS HOME. I SOMETIME THINK HE IS HERE WHEN I HERE A STRANGE NOISE. I DO BELIEVE IN THE AFTERLIFE AND THAT EVEN THOUGH WE CANT SEE THEM THEY ARE HERE.  I WILL BE SITTING ALONE AND HE COMES TO MY MIND. TONY I LOVE YOU AND CANT WAIT TO SEE YOU AGAIN. I KNOW YOU WILL BE THE FIRST PERSON I WILL SEE.,3UNH76FOCTR9IHYX0QXWRG0NUE7YMB,
