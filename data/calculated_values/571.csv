I was so happy that eventually i will be a working employee. I talked to my friend and family about it. My family met with the guy. After a long conversation everyone agreed that this was the man to trust. I trusted the guy so muchI broke my bank and used all available funds i had whenever the guy requested money to process the documents. Eventually the guy stopped all the communication. There was no way i could get in touch with him and this was after requested some cash to finalize the deal and set everything clear for me. I lost copies of testimonials and certificate in the process and cash too,I explained what happened to my parents. We decided to contact the police for aid in aim to trace the man. Our efforts did not bear fruits the man could not be traced. In the process we learned that several people had experienced the same case. I was so demoralized and it is almost impossible for me to trust someone. it is one of stories i do not like to share so much.",33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQ2GLBHZ,
