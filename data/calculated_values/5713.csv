It was about three hours drive from our place of residence. So we embarked on this journey on the early ours of Saturday which was the day of the wedding. Unfortunately, we did not follow through with traffic situation before we started the journey. While we set off, there was a terrific accident along the major express road leading out of the city. Apparently, a truck had fallen over three other cars. This was due to a fallen tree in the early hours that has not been cleared by the highway safety corp. This delayed our journey for further four more hours. Nevertheless we proceeded with the journey but we arrived very late meeting only the after party. It was a gathering of friends. We mingled. We drank. We jollied and made merry. On our way back, we were a bit too tired but chose to go ahead with the return journey. Some had had a few drinks too many. I suggested we stayed the night over, but the other insisted we go ahead. While coming back, we had a terrible accident. No live was lost. Just a few minor injuries.",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA86SHXUU
