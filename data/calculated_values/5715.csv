You make the face cut in the direction that you want the tree to fall. You then make the felling cut 180° from the face cut. In such a way that you can escape safely when the tree starts to crack and fall. Conventional wisdom says that you should not try to cut down a tree that has a lean in it. Or cut down a tree on a windy day. I was trying to cut down a tree that had a lean and it was windy. I made the face cut extra deep you're only supposed to go 30% I want about 50%. I was also using an axe which is inherently dangerous and much more difficult than a chainsaw but much more manly. As I was cutting the felling cut strong gust of wind came up and blew directly opposite where I wanted the tree to land. I then heard some cracking and so I ran 45° away from the tree. And much to my horror the tree went backwards. this resulted in the tree getting hung up and some other trees which is an even more dangerous situation. I picked myself up off the ground and looked at the situation which was not what I had been expecting. It was frightening but the realization didn't really hit me until the adrenaline had gone down a bit. I know the chopping down trees is dangerous but it can be relatively safe as long as you follow a few rules. I learned that you definitely need to follow those rules that day.,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA86SHXUU,
