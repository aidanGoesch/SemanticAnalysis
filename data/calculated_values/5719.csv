It was my 50th birthday and I was thankful that I was able to remember this time. Last year I had completely forgotten until my kids surprised me with a cake. Anyway, I got up and went straight to my routine. At this age, a routine is just what you have. Brushed my teeth, made some coffee, picked up the paper, made some breakfast. Wouldn't have it any other way. Well, I took a shower and wondered what I would do today. Nothing seemed appetizing so I just cleaned the house a bit. Around 5 oclock I heard the doorbell and it was my daughter asking to take me to dinner so I said sure, why not? She actually ended up taking me to her house and then I started to feel a little suspicious. She gave me the key and told me to head on in and that she was going to bring down some groceries she had gotten earlier. I said fine. I opened the door and I heard happy birthday screams all over the place and I felt my heart racing, in a good way. My family rushed over to hug me and say happy birthday. They threw me a surprise party when I thought I wouldn't have anything to do on this 50th birthday of mine.",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8D3XUX0
