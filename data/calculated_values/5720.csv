The kids woke me up early because they were excited to see what the Easter Bunny had brought for them and were eager to hunt for their eggs.  We all sat down and enjoyed a nice breakfast and relaxed while the kids tore into their baskets.       In the afternoon, we all thought it would be nice to take a walk to the beach and let the kids burn off some of that candy energy.  We all had a great time.  It had been a few hours so we thought we should head back to the house because we were expecting Jessica's in-laws for Easter dinner.     As we approached the house I noticed that the street was full of parked cars.  I figured all of the neighbors were having family over as well.  When I walked into the house I was stunned!  It was a surprise party for my 50th birthday!  There were so many people there, aunts, uncles, cousins and old friends, many I haven't seen in years.  We all ate and talked a lot, mostly catching up.  While we were eating cake the family surprised me with a video they had put together.  Everyone in my family had a part in it, even some old friends.  Each one of them wished me a happy birthday and talked about their most memorable moments with me.  I could hardly see because tears just kept running down my face.  I laughed a lot too, so many great memories, where does the time go?  I never expected this and felt so honored that my family thought so much of me to organize such a wonderful gift of memories.  It is the best gift I have ever received and now one of my most prized possessions.  I watched the video again after everyone had gone home.  This was one of the most memorable days of my life.",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8D3XUX0
