The theme park always decorates so intricately and creates an amazingly festive atmosphere that my family really enjoyed. We just arrived back home last week and I am already wishing I could go back! My absolute favorite part of the trip was watching the fireworks above the castle, they were simply stunning. The lines for the rides were extremely long due to the park being packed for the holidays, as well as the new Star Wars ride opening. Unfortunately I did not get to ride Rise of the Resistance because we had too many little children with us who were afraid. Instead we rode many of the rides in Fantasyland, which I love due to the nostalgic feelings of reminiscing about visiting the theme park when I was a young child. We also spent quite a bit of time shopping in Disney Springs. My nieces and nephews all had to buy various Mickey Mouse ears, which were adorable and holiday-themed. We also enjoyed just walking through all of the different shops to see the unique items they might have. I ended up buying a piece of jewelry for myself, which I love and am wearing right now! We ate dinner at Planet Hollywood, which has been another favorite of mine since I was a child and I have many good memories of eating at this restaurant in different areas of the United States. It also had a good kid's menu, so everyone was happy, and we all had their amazing milkshakes! On our last day in the parks we visited Epcot, which was so fun! We traveled around the work and sampled food at each place we went to.",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQBUXQ
