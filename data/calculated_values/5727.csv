I had quit my job and was driving for Uber. The only goal was to be with my fiance. She lives in Bogota, Colombia. I wanted to visit her for a few months. I bought a ticket and planned a trip to Bogota. I got up early one morning to catch the city bus to the airport. I had purchased a ticket to fly to Bogota and spend three months with my fiance.  The bus trip took about an hour. My flight was not until around twelve, I was a few hours early. I was so excited that I didn't care about the wait. The flight was going to take around four hours to complete. I had packed a lot of snacks to hold me over since I had spent all my money on the ticket.   Arriving at the airport in Bogota, I was greeted by my fiance. It was the happiest moment in my life. It had been almost a year since I last saw her.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQWUXB,
