I had been there  a few times before. Usually for a week or two. This trip was going to be long term. The plan was to be there for three months. I packed my bags the day before I was set to leave. I did not have a car and the airport was a few hours away. My flight was at 3 pm.   I left my dad's house at 5 am and took the city bus to the airport. I would arrive at 9 am and check in for my flight. I didn't have much money and had bought some snacks to tide me over. A few hours before my flight I went through security. I had never been so nervous. I was traveling with just two bags a laptop.  I had some PC gaming equipment and was unsure I would be able to get it through security.   I made it through with no problems and boarded my plane. Five hours later I was in Bogota and have never been happier.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQWUXB,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQWUXB
