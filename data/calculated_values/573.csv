After reconnecting, I guess we started to notice more little things about each other that we didn't like. We started to fight constantly over small things and couldn't agree on much. We still talked everyday but after a while it got to the point where I would want to ignore my phone. She started acting very odd, and it didn't take me too long to figure out she was cheating on me. Apparently, it was much more then that. She was cheating on me but she actually lived with another man, so I learned that I was some kind of side dude. It didn't really go over well with me, and I had been looking forward to this. I know that I was supposed to recall a important part of my life, and it seemed like a good story before this started to happen, so I apologize. Anyways, after fighting constantly, and a lot of arguing, we decided to become ""friends"". Of course, that wouldn't last very long because I got sick of it. In the end we had a falling out, and we are now, no longer speaking to each other. She is pregnant with another mans baby, and is currently still living with him. In the end, it was very dissapointing. I was really looking forward to having someone close to me, But at what cost? My happy diary entry, has turned miserable and for that I apologize.",33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQ2IKBH2,
