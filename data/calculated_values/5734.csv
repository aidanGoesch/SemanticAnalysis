I just always thought it was important to be able to manage money. Managing money can be very lucrative in the future for anyone. So I just thought it was best to learn it early on in life. I had a friend who struggled with doing just that. we weren't really friends at first it took time to connect. Our relationship started due to them not being able to budget correctly. So I was able to help them out with that. Due to my patience and advice it sparked a little friendship between us. Even after giving them advice I prayed for them to get help and learn how important it was to budget and save. I was grateful and joyful once we became friends. I ended up gaining a lot of help and outstanding relationship for years. All thanks to a prayer that helped me and friend out. Things can always get better due to practice. Being determined to do something will help out as well.,,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJMP1ZUH
