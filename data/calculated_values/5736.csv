So one day i show a lady in a store that coupons and i just ask her where do she get her coupons. At that time  she told me but it was too expensive for my budget. But i gave her my number to ask for cheaper prices. Days went on and no call from her but then i receive call from her and she said you thought i forgot about you. I was so happy to hear from her because it was a time i needed savings. She told me i don't usually call random people but because i ask nicely she felt my help and need. The couponing relationship between us was very distance because she was always busy. So for awhile i prayed again for help because things were going down hill. Then my joy return she meet with me give lots of coupons and a lot of advice. My prays was answered instantly and i was so grateful for her coming through for me. Ever since then we have been been like couponing sisters. There is always times she help me and i will help her in exchange. plus i've improved financially . And the conversations have grown more she has become my faithful friend that i prayed for. This is a memorable moment because i prayed for it and it took time. But if i never would've walked in that store and talk with her i would have walk out on a good friendship and excellent help.,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJMP1ZUH,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJMP1ZUH
