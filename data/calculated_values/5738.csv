I'll keep it brief. See, I was playing World of Warcraft, something I had been trying to stop doing by that time but still felt drawn to. I felt a strong urge to play that day, specifically at that moment. Turns out, that urge was justified, as that was the day I met the person who would eventually become my girlfriend. We've been together ever since. Now, on to the important event. Back in June, I finally had the opportunity to go meet her in real life. Both of us had been waiting for this moment, and it was finally here, and we were very excited. I left on a Saturday evening, the day just before Father's Day, by train. I brought an old laptop with me so we could keep in touch on the way there, since our preferred form of communication is through an online messaging platform called Discord. We talked all night, getting more and more excited the closer I got, even though we were also both growing more and more tired. I didn't get a single ounce of sleep that night, half due to my excitement and half due to the fact that I have a hard time sleeping on trains. Finally, after some delays, I arrived near her home town at roughly 10 AM on Sunday, and started walking down to the local train station to take a connecting train to her home town. After a few more hours, we finally met. Let me tell you... meeting her was far better than I had imagined it would be. Up to that point our relationship had been very intense, and we had become very close, despite our great distance physically. So believe me when I say it was magical when we finally met. I spent the next two weeks with her before I had to come back, and they were the best two weeks of my entire life. We're still together today, and I'm planning on moving to be with her for the rest of my life.",,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJWKLZU1
