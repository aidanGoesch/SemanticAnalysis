We met in high school, and almost right away became good friends. We haven't seen each other in a long time, and that's why we decided to come out for a good vacation. It was a lot of fun, and we did many things together. The beach was nice. And the weather was great. We swam, and told each other stories. My friends and I even build a sand castle together, even though I thought that was a little childish. But we had fun. And that's the most important part. We haven't seen each other in a while. So we had a lot to say. We enjoyed our time there, and had a blast. It was great. I'm never going to forget the time we spend together.",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MPWNNSL
