She and her hubby and me and hubby met on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. We spent a full and amazing week together! Despite the fact that it rained every single day, the four of us were so happy to be spending quality time together. We usually get together once a year, for the past 19 years, but recently illness has kept us from doing so. Therefore, this particular get-together was extra special! We were all healthy enough to enjoy the week. Sure, we all has a few more pills to take, as well as daily therapy-type exercises, than our previous get-togethers. But even through the aches and pains of aging, the week was fabulous. Some of the activities we did were: going to the beach, eating at local low-country restaurants (shrimp and grits... yeah!), attended a bon-fire at our villa, played bingo (woo-hoo... two of us won!), went ""house-hunting"" (looking at model homes is a favorite past-time whenever we get together), and especially just chit-chatting and catching up with life! One day was spent souvenir shopping for the grandkids. How fun was that? We helped each other choose really special gifts. (The 5 grandkids LOVED them all!)Even though it rained every single day, we had an awesome time. (The weather forecast was NOT accurate!) As always, this week was a special and memorable time that the four of us will not soon forget! I cannot wait till next year's get-together!",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MPWNNSL
