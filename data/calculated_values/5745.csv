I got into a habit of setting my alarm at 5am and going for a morning run before work. It really seems to give me energy through the day, and is the best workout imaginable at that time in the morning. My stamina has also increased nearly three times over, and I can run for a few miles easily without even feeling winded. About a month ago I went for a super long run back to my old hometown. It was still before sunrise and the town was eerily silent. I kept going towards an old elementary school that I attended as a kid. I'm not sure what came over me but I opted to stop running immediately noticed a massive tree I remember from school. We often used to climb this same tree during recess, and it brought positive memories to once again be in its presence. A tree that I took for granted at the time was standing before me, looking the same as always. I sat down under it and really started to think about life and how time passes us by. I felt a great deal of peace for the twenty odd minutes I sat down pondering. Then as I began to see the sun begin to wake, I gave one final stretch and look over my surroundings.  I felt strangely at peace with everything in life, filled with nostalgia even. I then hopped to my feet and began my long run back home as the sun escaped from the horizon.",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MQQ6SNY
