I was going kayaking, with my brother and his girlfriend.  We ate breakfast then loaded up the truck with the kayaks and drove out to the dock.  After parking and getting set up we were ready to go out on the river.  We had coolers filled with drinks and sandwiches, fruit and snacks. My brother's girlfriend started drinking as soon as she woke up, and didn't eat breakfast so the drinks started hitting her hard before we were even out on the water.  As we started kayaking I was having fun, but it was apparent that my brother's girlfriend was drinking too much and was going to have some issues.   She immediately lost her paddle and we had to hurry to grab it for her. She thought it was funny, well she thought everything was funny thanks to the influence of alcohol, and while she started laughing and having fun, my brother and I were in damage control mode, having to watch her and make sure that she was ok. I wasn't able to have a good time because everytime we got into a rhythm on the water, she would flip her kayak and we'd have to stop and fix everything again.  I was getting really frustrated, if she hadn't drank so much then we could be having an enjoyable time. I think next time my brother asks me to go kayaking with him I'm going to specify that it should only be me and him, that way I can have fun without worrying about another person.  I really wanted to have a good time today, I'm miffed that I wasn't able to because of one person.  Maybe if she would've ate breakfast it wouldn't have been so bad. I'm going to have a talk with my brother about this, maybe he can tell her how uncool her actions were.  I enjoy drinking and having a good time too, but not when we're doing something in water, that can be dangerous.",,3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ3BJ7A6
