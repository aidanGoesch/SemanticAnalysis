It was nerve racking because I thought I was over my head. Knowing that this was not in fact a mistake make me proud and grateful to the point i have reached today. For some reason I thought maybe that I was in over my head. Maybe I was reaching too high for the stars. However, something inside told me to reach out and grab it. I am glad I followed my instincts on this. If not, then I would feel like a failure for sure. It goes to show to trust yourself. Know what you are worth and dont be afraid to try something new. I tried things several times. i was just afraid that if I got it what is next. If not then what is next. Now I can rest assured that I will take this new position to heights never seen. I will not let them down.",,33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQR23BHE
