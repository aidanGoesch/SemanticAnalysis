I was so worried that I would not get it. So many people applied for this position. The hours were better, the pay was better, and even the benefits were better. The only thing is you would be working alot harder and you would be dealing with many more problems on a daily. It came time for the interviews. I remember my interview and how nervous I was. I was certain I completely failed at the interview. I can remember about 10 other people waiting to be interviewed for this position as I left the room. I waled to my car with tears streaming down my face. I was thinking there is no way you got this. Just keep trying for something else. This wasn't meant for you. I had all of these negative feelings and I really had no reason too. I had just as good of a chance as everyone else that was trying to get the position. I remember later that night I was home cooking dinner when I got the call confirming that I was the one who got the job. Still to this day I can not put into words how happy and proud I am of myself. I did this. Nobody else. I am just as worthy as anyone else. Never put yourself down you got this too.",,33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQR23BHE
