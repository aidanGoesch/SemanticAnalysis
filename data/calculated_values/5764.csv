We all decided that Lucky was a good name for him. Lucky has been an amazing dog, but he can be a bit nosy. Lucky came into my room last night and tore up a pair of my jeans. I wasn't very mad, as I understand that he's young, and still learning. I started closing my door, and punishing him when I found him looking in my room. He stays in his kennel overnight with my parents, and loves it. His kennel is his home, and he is free to leave whenever he pleases. He generally doesn't do that great with other dogs, but is fantastic with people. He's huge for his age, he weighs well over 100 lbs, and absolutely beautiful. I can't believe the old owners took him to the shelter, he is the best dog I've ever had. Aside from the time he jumped on the table and ate my sandwich. But that's okay, because he's learned since then. Most of the time, he spends his time looking out the window, and just relaxing, which is odd, because he doesn't like staying outside very long. All in all, I'm excited to have this dog, and he's becoming a fantastic dog.",,3V0Z7YWSIZM27JZZLXRS58IVGOEV20
