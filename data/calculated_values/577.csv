It was the trip that involved my family. The main reason for this trip was my son. He was in a competition of skater.  So, he needs to reach their and so were we out their to cheer him up. He was very much confident about her win and so were we. We were also very much happy to cheer him up. Great time for us. Our whole family was travelling and so there was a kind of mess and all the members were very much hyped and happy. We all lived up for the journey in a bus. It was a mini bus. After reaching their, we had a tent were we lived for around 36 hrs. Meanwhile, my son had a practice over their for couple of times and then the main competition started. My son came second. We were happy for that too. It was the proud moment for our family. We enjoyed very much out there.",,33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQS2THBB
