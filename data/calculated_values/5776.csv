My father was diagnosed with Congestive Heart Failure and he also has a blood clot in his heart right now. Its been so tough because my father does not have health insurance and we have been trying to find some that will take him on. It is also really emotionally draining because he is such a strong man and now he is so sick and does not want to do anything. He takes so much medicine now and he just is not the same father I grew up with. I have been working extra shifts at my job to help with his medical bills and his prescription medicine. I feel like I have to do what I have to do to take care of my dad. He took care of me all those years, now I will repay the favor. He is so quiet, he likes to lay in his bed and watch his shows on TV still. I like to go in the room with im and cuddle up and watch some tv with him to spend some more time with him. We have a great dane who my dad raised since he was a puppy and even the dog seems really sad. He likes to hang out by my dads bed because he is not lalowed on th ebd. Everyone is really sad. My dad keeps talking about setting up funeral arrangements. I really hate talking about that kind of stuff. I liove my dad but this has taken a huge toll on our family.",,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCNFH32R
