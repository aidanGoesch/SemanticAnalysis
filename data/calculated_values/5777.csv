My father used to be a fairly healthy person. While he could have improved his diet, it's not like he was constantly eating fast food or anything like that. But, he works a very stressful job which has only gotten more stressful over the past year. My mother and I noticed that it seemed like he was getting out of breath more easily, and it seemed like his skin was always very red. After a few months of noticing this, we suggested that he should see a cardiologist. He's so stubborn, though, that he didn't finally make the appointment until 2 weeks ago. When the results came back, we were stunned, but not particularly surprised. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and they think he has a blood clot. They scheduled surgery for next month, and the entire family is very stressed out at the thought. My father has been forced to quit working temporarily in order to not aggravate the condition before the surgery. We are all very nervous because the surgeons told us there is a somewhat significant chance the operation could kill my father. In addition, because my dad hasn't been working, it's been up to me to financially support the family in the mean time. I asked my boss to give me extra hours, but there was only so many they could give me so it's been a bit rough. I thought about selling some of my stuff, like my extra monitors and computers, but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm just praying that the operation goes well so we can live our lives as a happy family again.",,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCNFH32R
