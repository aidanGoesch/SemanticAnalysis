I was surprised by the lack of traffic, we were way too early! But it was good because we were able to find a Dunkin Donuts and have something to eat, also time to make sure ""B's"" hair looked right. We got to the rink and had a look around, it was freezing cold, much colder than I expected and I regretted my clothing choice and not bringing blankets. ""B"" was super excited and I was worried he was going to be tired by the time of his event. Other families arrived for the competition and one of the boys that ""B"" was competing against arrived and just seemed off, like he was annoyed about us being there. I smiled at his mother but she pretended to not see me. I was so nervous for ""B"", I just wanted things to go well for him and do everything possible to help him do well. ""B"" wasn't nervous at all, surprisingly! The morning dragged on and finally it was time for him to get into costume. His coach took him for a walk outside and then we sat in stands and waited, I felt like I was going to be sick. Then ""B"" skated and he did well, he did really well. We waited for the results and we found out he won. He was so thrilled, we were all thrilled, my older son said it was worth all the waiting around. Then we waited for the medal ceremony which was a bit of a saga due to miscommunication, someone had told the rink we had left so they tried to do the ceremony without ""B"". Anyway, ""B"" won and it was a very special time. We then packed up and drove the 2 hours home. I felt so relieved and could breathe again, all his hard work was paying off.",33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQS2THBB,
