I always have a good time in Vegas gambling. I played roulette as this is my game of choice. I usually have good luck playing this game. I had a budget in mind to gamble.  I got on a winning streak and decided to go over it.  That was a bad decision.  I started to lose. I kept thinking I will end up winning again on the next round. I didn't. I ended up losing all of the money I had budgeted to gamble with plus alot more. This was the end of me playing roulette. I have promised myself I will never gamble again.  At lease I wont be playing roulette ever again. I am really sad about this decision as I loved playing roulette but it evidenty is not a game for me.,,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCYYW32J
