She lives around 3 hours away due to school so we always plan and get together when possible. For this trip we decided to check out the local Hibachi grill for dinner then go peruse the carnival that just so happened to be in town this weekend.  When she arrived, I couldn't help but give her the biggest bear hug since it had been so long since our last meet. We decided that we would try a new Hibachi place that had opened up in town for dinner. When we were seated, we got paired with a group of people who were celebrating a birthday. Everyone was jovial and incredibly friendly. Our grill chef was also such a pleasure. Everything was going great, he was flipping shrimp and making the flames almost lick the ceiling. We stared in awe as he balanced an egg on his cooking flat. Unfortunately he made a mistake while doing his flare. Poor guy ended up tossing an egg, and instead of catching it; it landed flat on his head and broke open. There was egg all over him!! It was hard not to laugh at this guy's misfortune but he took it like a champ. After a brief recess he was back at it to finish up our dinner. When our bellies were nice and full we headed off to the carnival. There were lights and rides and games everywhere. My friend even won me a giant teddy to keep as a memory of the night. To end the evening we rode the Ferris Wheel. Looking at the city lights twinkle against the night sky was awe inspiring. I will never forget the time we had together and we are already planning our next trip!",,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEI1JEO1I
