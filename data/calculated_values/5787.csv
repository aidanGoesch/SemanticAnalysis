We usually try to see each other at least three to four times a year due to the distance between us. My friend lives further north and I live further south in the United States. Every year we try to get together over the phone and discuss the arrangements. Where we're going to stay, how much it will cost for both plane and hotel tickets and arrangements. As well as the types of foods we'd be interested in and also what we plan to do together when we get to see each other. We had been playing it for the last three months and we finally got to see each other earlier this month. Fall is always my favorite time of year and my friend really likes when it's cooler while visiting because they cannot stand the heat. So, it's the perfect time for us to get together and hang out and spend time together. Once my friend arrived, I went to pick them up from the airport and we drove to our hotel. Afterwards, we spent sometime in the room adjusting and getting our items unpacked. Then we decided we were hungry. We ordered our food and went to pick it up. We decided to go to a grill-like restaurant and pick up some hamburgers and fries. Afterwards we came back to the hotel and ate. The next day we went to a carnival for ""October"", which is my favorite time of year. So, we walked around together, just talking and enjoying each other and we played some games as well as rode the Spider, this one ride that looks like a space-ship and spins really fast, I don't know what it is called. We then got on this really high ride that goes up into the sky and then falls back down really fast. It's really scary and I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy it because I hate heights. But it was really fun and we had a great time. We then went back to the hotel and enjoyed the evening with one another. Sitting and watching a cop shop that we both love and it was just a really beautiful and fun time together and I'll always cherish our time together because it is so special to me and to my friend.",,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEI1JEO1I
