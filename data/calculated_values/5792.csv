It was a very exciting moment, but very surreal that he would be leaving home. We have a very close relationship, so this is very strenuous event for all of us. When he got his letter, we were all extremely excited. It was his college of choice and it is a bit difficult to get into it. But, his hard work paid off. We are now preparing for his entry, including gathering everything he needs and completing all necessary paperwork, which is bittersweet. It makes me very emotional to think about him being nearly three hours from home, as travelling is quite difficult for me. So, I won't be able to visit as often as I'd like. I plan to set up a webcam so we can chat via video while he's away. However, it isn't the same as him being around all the time. I easily start to cry when I think about this. He is very excited, but nervous about this adventure. He has conveyed that he sometimes becomes very scared about being away from home as well, which really makes me nervous. But, I really hope he thrives in this environment. I counted 5 squares.",3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEIHZTO19,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEIHZTO19
