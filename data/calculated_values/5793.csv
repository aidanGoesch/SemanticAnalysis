I like to go go-cart riding. It's really fun and relaxing and kind of thrilling to time a turn right. Well, I drove my go-cart over to the track which was a mistake but I don't have a car that it fits in. I had a couple nice rounds on the track and it was a really pretty day but then my gas line started to leak which was dumb because I just did a whole bunch of maintenance on my cart and should have caught if the line was bad. But the gas got everywhere! I got it all over my hands and my pants. I should have known to clean it up too after I reattached the line but I wasn't thinking and just started the cart back up. IT CAUGHT FIRE. It was so awful! I had to jump out of the cart so I didn't catch fire and run for the fire extinguisher. I managed to get it out okay and nothing on the track got damaged but my cart was ruined. My gas line was warped and important parts of the motor were completely melted. I think the owner of the track felt really bad for me because he agreed to store the cart until I decided what I wanted to do with it, try and repair it or just scrap it for parts. A new cart is so expensive though. I still don't know the answer to that one. But then I was kind of stuck. I didn't have my phone on me so I couldn't call someone for a ride and I certainly didn't have a go-cart to ride back home in. So I had to walk. I didn't even realize how far away the track was until I just had to huff it on foot. It's far! Like, at least five miles. It took me a whole hour to get home and I was exhausted. So I was out a go-cart and winded from the walk. I basically just played video games for the rest of the day to make myself feel better.",,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEISP91OT
