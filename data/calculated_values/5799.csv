As he approached he bumped against the table. I've noticed him bumping into things a lot lately but I thought he was just being clumsy. He has a bobtail so he's not as graceful as other cats I've seen... cats use their tails for balance. Anyway, I picked him up to comfort him and saw a bloody spot on his eye. It was kind of a dull brownish red, and I hadn't noticed it before. It wasn't a recent injury and it wasn't from hitting the table. I decided to see if it healed up or went away, and it didn't. Meanwhile, he kept on bumping into things. I decided it was probably time for a visit to the vet. I made the appointment, scooped him up into his carrier on the day of the appointment, and drove him out. He yowled the entire way because he hates going to the vet. We checked in and waited. After we got called back to the treatment area I explained my concerns. The tech weighed him, took his temperature, and looked into his eyes. A few minutes later the vet came in and we started talking. The vet peered into my kitty's eyes and quickly determined it was a tumor of some sort. ""These kinds of things happen sometimes as cats age, and usually there are a couple of choices. We can wait it out and see if it spreads, or we can go ahead and take the eye out. Keep in mind that if we let it spread there's a good chance your cat will go completely blind, but taking the eye out will cause a great seal of discomfort the rest of his life, and besides bumping into things, he doesn't seem to be hurting. So which would you like to do?""I decided to wait, and it looks like that was a wise choice. The cancer has not spread and my cat still wanders around bumping into things, but he is otherwise happy and in great condition for a half blind cat.",3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPGD7SG2,
