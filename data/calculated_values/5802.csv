On the airplane over there, it was a night flight, so after dinner the kids managed to fall asleep and i was able to watch a movie. i was to anxious to fall asleep, incase my kids woke up. So, instead o i just watched tv the whole flight. my husband of course was able to sleep the entire flight. This is very typical of him and he would sleep through a freight train going through. When we arrived we quickly went through immigration, but no one was there to meet us. we were very frustrated with my husbands's family for forgetting to pick us up after we made the big effort to fly there. after a phone call they apologized and said they were on their way, but we said forget it, we will get a cab. despite the rough start we had a nice week in spain visiting family and friends and then it was time to fly home. this was a day flight which was a lot harder than the flight over there. my youngest son napped for a little bit but he was very restless for the rest of the flight and i was exhausted. my husband was no help and he even fell asleep himself. my other son just watched tv so he was fine. when we arrived home finally, the two kids were jetlagged and woke up at 3am for the day, and i had to get up with them. I decided i would never go back again!",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPOAFSGC
