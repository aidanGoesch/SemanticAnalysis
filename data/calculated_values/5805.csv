I helped at that moment by lifting the body so that they would take care of him in the hospital. Then wait to see how everything turned out. They gave us the worst news, the driver had passed away. It was somewhat traumatic after that incident suffered post-traumatic stress. I had a hard time getting out of that situation. but with will I succeeded. I guess they are experiences. things that have to happen and that leave a lesson. Everything is in the mind. and well nobody will return the driver's life. It was a very unfortunate moment for him.",3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPPEKGSE,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPPEKGSE
