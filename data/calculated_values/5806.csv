Well, 6 months ago, they've all returned home to be with me and my wife.  To have someone interrupt your life so abruptly is devastating to say the least.  They've returned with more people than when they left us.  We now have 6 grandchildren, which they're not biologically mine.  We have come adjusted to living alone for so many years.  As we transition into being senior citizens, this hasn't been easy at this time in our lives.  But, if I could alter all of the event, I don't think I would because some things happen for a reason.  We all may need each other in the future so  being in close contact might make things easier.  At the moment, neither me nor my wife has any disabilities so we're physically able to help our selves as well as our children with their children, our grandchildren.  My wife and I own our own business, so help transporting the grandchildren to and from school won't be a problem as it would be working for someone else.  Perhaps, one day, when we're ready to retire, one of our children could or may want to take over the business for us.  Everyday, my wife prepares breakfast for everyone.  Our children has really enjoyed this.  It has freed up time for them in the mornings.  They won't have to rush to prepare breakfast along with getting the children ready for school.  I used to be a teacher.  So, in the evenings, I usually assist with homework assignments.  One of the grandchildren has struggled with math.  But, since I've become her tutor, she now excels in the subject.  She was misbehaving in school because she couldn't understand the material.  She has made a turn around.  We're planning a trip to the beach for Labor Day.  I have a road vehicle, so we can sleep in it instead of paying those outrageous fees for a hotel.  We don't plan on cooking so everyone will have to help buy lunch and dinner.",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13GS8
