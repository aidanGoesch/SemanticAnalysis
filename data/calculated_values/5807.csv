My wife is ten years older than I and had been a child bride after being raised in a cult.  When she broke free doing so meant losing her children, and four of the five that she lost have come back into our lives after she had missed them for 17 years.  She was able, because of their return, to be there when her eldest child proposed to his girlfriend and began wedding planning.  She is excitedly buying things for the wedding but I know how much the hole in the timeline that their absence made will never quite fill.  I know that she will always miss the time that she missed with them and all the memories that she would have made over the years with them, but seeing her excitedly bustle and plan and be filled with joy as she plans to watch her son, her first baby, be happy is sometimes a bit overwhelming to me.  I am so happy for her and yet fell so badly for the pain she is still in.  It is admittedly strange watching the kids blend together, as she had one child with a subsequent partner and then later two with me.  Eight kids, and seven of them are regularly in our lives.  it is chaotic, and funny, and sweet, and scary.  Seeing the ways that the kids are all the same and yet so diverse is neat.  It is often strange realizing that my eldest stepson is only 8 years younger than I am.  It is shocking to others that we are already grandparents, though our son doesn't have contact with his daughter.  I wish that I could help them more, with their challenges in life.  I hope that I am doing enough to support my wife while our family makes these transitions.  I am certainly trying.",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13GS8
