I work there every Summer at a music institute for 8 weeks.   Well at that same time my wife became ill. Not sure what was wrong with her but it may have been Lyme disease that she got from a tick bite while on a camping trip a few weeks before. So not only was she ill she was an ill mood. She started taking out her anger and dissatisfaction at being sick on me because she said I wasn't ""taking care of her."" Not sure what she wanted me to do but I was busy packing. Then at one point she flew into a rage and said I shouldn't come back after I finished my work in the mountains. I was taken aback by this but didn't say anything. I knew if I started arguing with her it would erupt into a huge argument. I couldn't do it. So I didn't say anything. I could not have my travel preparations interrupted. I was already afraid I was going to be late because I had started preparing later than I should have.   That was 2 1/2 months ago. I haven't  called her or spoken to her since that day nor has she called me. Although I'm sad about breaking up I feel it was time for that to happen. Too many un-resolvable problems in that relationship. Overall I'm happy, and I'm living on my own still in the mountains.",3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13SGK,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13SGK
