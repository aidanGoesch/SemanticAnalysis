I have well knowledge in professional photography. My friends appreciated me by my innovative photographs. Many times I participated and awarded in my college photography competition. Before six months, State level wild life photography contest announced by a nonprofit organization. I had been chosen Indian forests as location of photoshoot. After few days I started to study about weather condition ,plants and animals lived in Indian forests with the help of Google and Television. In India,Especially I had chosen Western Ghats in South India. I traveled to India. I stayed 10 days in that location. Daily I took my equipment and went to forest with the help of local forest guard. and I captured beautiful natural elements . Such long rivers, big mountains and .Animals such as Tigers, Elephants, Bears and also variety of birds. After those beautiful days, I returned America. and submitted my photographs to juries of contest. There was heavy competition. I feared slightly. I had lot of confidence on my photographs. One day morning, I was checking my inbox . I got a mail from committee who were organizing photography contest. Yes I succeeded. My photos were selected for first prize. The first prize was 15000 dollars. I just surprised . I was very happy .",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ2BGSI
