My husband had worked his job for over eight years and life seemed to be moving well. We enjoyed our new town living close by in our camper. We knew it would be a few months until we could move on our property while living in our RV. It just happened that the day we went to closed on our property my husband received a phone from his work. He had just lost his job. It could not have come at a worse time. We were just hours away from closing on the the property and start the house building process. One of the smart things that we did was pay cash for our property. So losing the property was not even on the horizon. It was ours, but it would delay us from actually building our home. So there we were homeless. We had a home, but not a brick and mortar home. Not one that was stable. Or so we thought. We took this opportunity to travel with our boys. We had a bit of a savings and decided that we would travel. Our home had wheels and we could take it anywhere with us! We saw parts of the country we had never seen. Stayed in places we would have never stayed in if it was not for him losing his job. We woke up to some of the most stunning sunrises and went to bed with the absolute gorgeous sunsets. I remember my son saying mom we do need a house we have a home.  He was right. We had a home it just had wheels.",,3VD82FOHKRAKFHI4HEUKMTX95HBOCG
