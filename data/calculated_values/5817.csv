We took our young sons to  Sesame Place to have some fun on this weekend.  Because our children are young we spent most of our day doing character meet and greets. I was so excited to see their faces when they met their favorite characters. I even got to have my picture taken with Cookie Monster, my childhood favorite character.  It was so much Fun because of the heat we did stick mostly to the shows in between rides and meet and greets.  I was surprised how entertaining they were.  My favorite had to be Sesame Street Neighborhood! Elmo, Abby Cadabby and Big Bird! Sing, dance, and clap along as you are transported to the Sesame Street Neighborhood.  ""Sunny Day. Sweepin' the clouds away. on my way to where the air is sweet! Can you tell me how to get? How to get to Sesame Street!! It was truly for a me a walk down memory lane. I think I danced and sang harder than the kids did. But that's the great thing about being a kid at heart its always  a trip.  The ride themselves were great but the heat did make them feel like it took forever and we even had to take a time out at go get ice cream cause it was just too hot on the asphalt.  Which itself was great too, we got pops in the shapes of all the characters and even had a visit from Mr cooper!   My toddlers really had a great time and It was a great day outing. We did skip eating it the park cause its was really high but you expect that when you travel to theme parks. By the time we left at dinner everyone was ready for a nap.  We danced and sang and had a ball. it surely will be some of our greatest memories of them when they were young.  I highly recommend this to anyone who kids are into Sesame Street!",,3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSC4YT8F1
