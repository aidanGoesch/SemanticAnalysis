This was a family trip for my sons to experience something really fun and exciting! It was the perfect place to go because they love the show Sesame Street. We knew it would be age appropriate. They loved it! They each went on a few rides and met LOTS of characters. They were especially starstruck when they met Big Bird and Elmo. My oldest son was pretty afraid of the big characters but that soon turned to delight. He just needed a bit to warm up. The best part was the parade where you get to see all the characters at once. The music is so fun and it's just an incredible experience. To our surprise, Elmo pulled my oldest son out of the parade which was so exciting. I'll never forget when he grabbed his hand! I will always cherish the wonder and awe my kids experienced at this place. A perfect place for their ages!",3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSC4YT8F1,
