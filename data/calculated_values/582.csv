I had been training very hard, and my boss had hinted I would be the one to receive this promotion. I was very excited about the prospect because the position not only came with a private office, but also including a great pay raise. I had even gone so far as to tell my parents how excited I was. However, on the day I should have received the job, no email from our upper management team ever came. I stayed calm at first, but as the next day saw no communication too, I began to worry. I had been banking on a the new job for a while. I tried to reassure myself that maybe they had just made a mistake or were busy. As I tried to calm myself down, I began to hear loud voices from another side of the office. People were congratulating a coworker. The feeling hit me a lightning bolt. They had given the job to someone else. I remember being very confused and jealous at first. My statistics were the best in the office. It should have been me. I felt lied to by my manager. The most memorable part was hearing all of the congratulations which should have been for me. I am still trying to not let this get to me and it has been several months.",33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP7798IYC8M,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP7798IYC8M
