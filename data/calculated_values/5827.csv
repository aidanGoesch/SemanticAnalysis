I felt like I was dying. I had never felt pain like this before. It came from nowhere. I thought it would pass. It never did. So I drove to the hospital. I didn't have anywhere to put my trailer, and the hospital had a service where they put  your trailer in a free camp spot. It was such a hassle that it honestly was not worth it. The security did such a bad job that I can't believe I owe the hospital money after that. They totally ruined my trailer. It was completely dented and banged up. Anyway, it turns out my appendix burst. I had surgery and had it removed. Ultimately, it wasn't that serious. I am still mad about the trailer though.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540O51FU
