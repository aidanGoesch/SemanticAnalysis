I was a little worried about staying at the hotel, because I hadn't budgeted quite enough if everyone didn't pay their way, but my worries were unfounded. Everyone paid their way and I shouldn't have spent so much time worrying about it. We met in the parking lot after work and we made a caravan to the hotel. I suppose we could have just driven to the concert on the day of the concert, but it's just so much more fun to go together and take the shuttle once we're there. Anyway, we made the caravan and got to the hotel about 9 p.m. on Friday, and had rooms across the hall and next door to each other. We had pizza and stayed up and watched movies and room hopped. I haven't done that in years. It was a good time to reconnect with a couple of people I hadn't really talked with much in a while, as well. Saturday we slept in, or tried to -- I got up early and went down and ordered coffee and bagels, etc. for everyone and had them sent up.  Someone had already ordered our spots on the shuttle, so after we all got organized, we shuttled over about an hour and a half before the concert. That's the way to do it! No waiting in the lines for hours, and no walking the long way. I suppose I don't mind not doing that as much as I get older -- it would have been a cinch 20 years ago, but I sure don't mind the 'old peoples' bus' now!  The concert was fantastic! I was glad to be in a space where the people weren't all filming it as much with the cell phones -- I feel like everyone misses the show doing that. It's just not my thing, I guess. After the concert, we grabbed the shuttle and stayed up way too late but it was fantastic. Sunday, we caravanned back after a mimosas brunch.  I'm glad to have reconnected with everyone and I made plans with a couple of people to go to the next concert at the venue and spend another weekend. The concert was great, but I think the social opportunity was probably just as much fun.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540O91FY
