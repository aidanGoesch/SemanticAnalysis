I'd seen them once in concert before, and it was great!  I learned that they were going to be touring in America again (they are from Denmark).  I checked the tour schedule but found that they were not going to be coming to my town.  However, they had a couple tour dates at cities roughly 4-5 hours away.  I couldn't pass up this opportunity!  So I reserved tickets and a hotel room for myself and my husband in Evansville, Indiana.  That morning we got up and packed our bags, then headed out for our drive.  It rained the whole way but we didn't care!  We listened to music and chatted about life.  The drive was pretty uneventful.  We stopped for lunch and had grilled chicken, burgers and salad.  We arrived in Evansville around 4 pm and checked into the hotel.  It was pretty nice and was right across the street from the concert venue.  We had a few snacks and drinks, then headed over to pick up our tickets.  Eventually we got in line to enter the building for the show.  We were able to get spots very close to the front!  The show was fantastic and we loved having the chance to see Volbeat again.  We crashed in the room later that night.  In the morning we had a huge breakfast and then drove home.  It was a great little getaway!",3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540O91FY,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540O91FY
