It was beautiful. We travelled to Costa Rica, and flew our closest family and friends out to be a part of the ceremony. It was expensive, but it was worth it. Nothing was more important to us than sharing that day with our loved ones! We began our day very early that morning. The men and the ladies attended separate breakfasts, and I was shocked when I received a beautiful family heirloom from my husband's mother.  Next we all went to get ready. We got married around 2 PM, and then we had the reception. We dined on local food for the reception, it was very delicious and the perfect way to kick off our new life together. I danced with my husband, and then with my dad, and then we stayed for about 45 more minutes before we left to begin our honeymoon. Everyone stayed for a week, and then my husband and I left to befgin our offical honeymoon in Europe. We stayed in Europe for 2 months, and then we came back to the United States to vacation in Vermont for a month. The wedding was all I ever dreamed of and more. What's even better is that my union to my best friend was celebrated and enjoyed by the people closest to us. Our families bonded, and it was just a really beautiful way to begin our new life together.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540OBF1E
