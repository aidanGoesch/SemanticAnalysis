A few years ago I got into a college of my dreams and was very excited. We had frosh at the beginning. This is a time for people to meet each other and get used to being at a new school, and to have some fun. I met some friends there and we ended up hanging out for most of our free time. A few years later we had a thanksgiving party. This is where the good turned too bad. I decided to do some magic mushrooms with my friends. They ended up blacking out and even got physically violent. I had never seen such a strange personality change occur. I never expected to see that side of them. It caused nightmares for me that night. I couldn't look at them the same afterwards. We planned just to have a good time but things got out of control. Now I hardly talk to them any more.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540PCF1H
