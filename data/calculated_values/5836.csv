I was kicked out of that college at the end of the Fall 2018 semester, and had been missing them for a good few months. At first all went well, and we hit it off with some ordered pizza and video games. Things got strange mid-way through, however, and the student that I was visiting started acting strange. He began to get uncomfortably close, and started making inappropriate gestures and comments. These gestures included kissing my hand, cuddling me unprompted, and saying strange things about me and my body. I spent that entire night trying to distract myself from the situation, knowing that I wouldn't be able to go home until morning. I could barely sleep that night, and spent most of that night talking to one of my online friends to try to keep myself calm. She agreed that the situation was strange, and that I was right to feel the way I did. When the morning came I covertly called in my ride home, pretending to be asleep until she would arrive. The student didn't wake up until late, so I was able to slip out of the dormitory building undetected with all of my belongings packed. The ride home was awkward, and I made no attempt to tell my ride why I called her in so early in the morning. I was just happy to be out of the situation, despite deep down feeling conflicted and sad. After I got home from the ordeal I laid down for a bit, and thought about the situation thoroughly, trying to find something to make sense of it all. For that entire day I ghosted the student, not answering any of his messages or making any attempt to reach out to him over the situation. I felt filthy, and to say that I was depressed for that period was an understatement. When I finally did gather up the courage to tell him how I felt, I had to force the confrontation out of myself.  He apologized, and said that he wouldn't do it again. He said that he agreed he felt his actions were wrong, and in the heat of the moment. However, that was not the end of his behavior in that way, and I spent more months talking to him and subjecting myself to his treatment. That event is the central event that made me question whether or not he was really my friend, and whether he considered me an object instead of a person. I have sense blocked him on all forms of social media, and make no contact with him whatsoever.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540PCF1H
