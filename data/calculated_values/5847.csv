We fortuitously found a rental property with horse facilities (a shipping container converted to a shelter/barn with a tack room-storage area attached.) The new house is a manufactured home, but a large, luxurious one, with acres of open space, a river, and abundant widlife all around. It's so nice, but it was a ton of work organizing the move and pulling it off on short notice. We called in all of out friends to help, and managed to move in less than a month. We were greatly relieved, and yet too exhausted to complete unpacking, to this day. A few weeks after we moved, my father, who lived in another state, became suddenly ill and passed away. Since then I have been preoccupied with grieving and settling his affairs, and we still feel as though our move is incomplete. But, we have an amazing place to live and play, a great landslady who is a fellow equstrian enthusiast like my wife, and have had a few memorable housewarming and welcoming parties and events at our house. We are starting to feel very much at home and comfortable here, and more like real Oregonians. We were just back in Califormia, where we both grew up and lived most of our lives, over the holidays. It was great visiting friends and celebrating our anniversary and the New Year. We both agree though, that despite the long, rainy and gray Oregon winters, we are happy and feel at home here. I have been contemplating moving again when I retire, in five years or so, possibly to Nevada. But we are starting to feel more and more that we have a new-found home, and may decide to stay in this area. There is something about the deep humid embrace of the Pacific Northwest that is becoming more a part of us every day.",3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354X6A1FW,
