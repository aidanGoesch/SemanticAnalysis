It is on a small parcel, but is set up as a horse property. We had been looking for aplace like that since we moved to the area three years ago. Nothing was available at the time, so we rented a home in town, and have since boarded the horses several different places. Most recently, they have been at a large horse facility several miles away, that my wife has to commute to once or twice a day. We are very pleased to be moving to a more rural location, without the traffic noise and close neighbors we have here. We will be a bit disappointed to be further away from all the amenities and entertainment we enjoy here in town, and can cycle to, but we will adjust. It's no further of a commute to work for me in terms of time than where we are now. I'm really looking forward to the quiet and being able to see the stars again! It is stressful to pack up and move right now, with the garden burgeoning and my summer field schedule at work. I am having to take almost two weeks off of work, and have a lot to do, so I will have to keep checking in as we proceed with our packing, moving and cleaning. I will be relieved when this move is over and we are settled in. The landlord is a colleague of my wife's in her equestrain group, and is very nice. The horses will love being in the country, and not competing with all the other horses at the boarding stable. I can't wait to be there, but am dreading the moving tasks. My back will not be happy with all the manual labor - lifting, hauling, etc. We fortunately have a number of friends willing to assist. We need to throw a party after we've moved in to celebrate.",3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354X6A1FW,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354X6A1FW
