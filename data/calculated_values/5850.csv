For some back story, my wife has always lived upper-middle class and my family, including my sister, is of lower class. We knew that this particular beach had a reputation for being rather...well trashy. I talked my wife into going and we packed up the car with our two sons (four and one) and took the two hour drive down to the beach. My mother had taken me to this beach when I was a kid and on the drive there I described it to my wife and small and empty. When we arrived it huge and absolutely packed. Boy was my memory off. We ended up parking about a quarter mile away and lugged all of our stuff down toward the beach where we ran into my sister. We exchanged hugs and she led us to their area. To my surprise it was actually really nice. They had a large tent set up to keep the bugs out, a grill cooking up burgers and hot dogs, lots of yard games for kids and adults alike. Immediately my oldest son and my sister's boy started running around having a ball. We hung out for hours playing and eating. We sang happy birthday, had cake, swam in the water. I nearly lost an eye when my son completely missed the pinata. Everyone in my family had a fantastic time. During the ride home I asked my wife what she thought of the party and the beach and she said she really enjoyed herself and wished we would have gone there more often when we lived closer. Just goes to show that you should always give something a chance before judging it.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354ZMUF1S
