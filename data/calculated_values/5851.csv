I wasn't due for another 2 months, so this was not good. I panicked, my husband panicked. We were at home cooking dinner when it happened. Our car was in the shop, so we couldn't get to the hospital by ourselves. We had to go to our neighbors and ask them for a ride. We rushed there and the staff took me to a room right away. When they found out that I wasn't due for 2 more months, the look they gave each other made me even more scared. The worst scenarious were going through my mind. Was the baby going to die soon after birth? Was there going to be some kind of birth defect? Was it going to have some kind of incurable illness that would cost us thousands of dollars. I started to cry. After 8 hours there, he was born. He had an infection and was quite small. But 2 months later, he seems to be doing fine. He's still smaller than he should be, but the doctor said he sees nothing wrong with him. I named him Jerry.",,3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNT42XRGE
