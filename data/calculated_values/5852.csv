Previous hospital visits and scans had assured us that everything was fine and the baby was going to be a girl. We were glad and anticipating her arrival especially since we already had a boy as our first child. On the day of delivery, I drove her to the hospital for normal check up. We never really had an idea what was coming. On arrival at the hospital, the Doctor examined her and told us it was time. I was shocked as we didn't come for delivery but rather for a hospital checkup. She was admitted and I drove back home to bring her stuffs. I was at home getting the stuffs and thinking about our new responsibility that is underway when I receved a call that she has put to bed. I was so overjoyed, speechless and felt grateful. I didn't know what to do. I later rushed to the hospital to see my bundle of joy. She was so cute like her mother. I never thought we will have it that easy. Especially knowing what we passed through with our first son. It was such a memorable day.",,3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNT42XRGE
