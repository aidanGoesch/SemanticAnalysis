It's an indescribable feeling, to walk into a crowd, totally anonymous and yet completely understood. About four weeks ago I went to a Bad Religion concert; that is where I discovered this feeling. In the space of just five hours I experienced things that I think people take lifetimes to discover. I made friends and I danced with perfect strangers. I experienced an emotional roller-coaster moving swiftly from excitement, nervousness, frustration, delight, and finally into pure unadulterated ecstasy. I even got to meet the band! The guys were amazing, I felt like an old friend visiting them. I really expected the meet and greet to suck, they'd be tired from performing and just want us gone. It wasn't like that at all! For a moment I thought one of them was going to invite me to an after party but when someone yawned the moment was gone. What is really the magic of all of this is that weeks later, I can still feel the traces of how that day made me feel. I can't believe it's been nearly a MONTH since then! I desperately want to go to another show. I've been checking the tour dates just hoping they'll update with one near me soon. So far the closest one is in Cincinnati, probably too far away. I might just look at flights anyway. You never know, right? Oh, who am I kidding? I can't afford even the cheapest flight. Maybe going to another show will feel the same, I doubt it. I mean who else has the kinds of fans and stage presence as Bad Religion? I heard Pink is coming to town, maybe I will look at those ticket prices. I know some of my friends like Pink though, I really want to go alone, like I did before. I know I will see them play again, I just hope I can do it soon!",,3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNTEYIGRQ
