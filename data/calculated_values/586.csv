We participated in a number of activities, including a Nascar race (which was postponed, unfortunately). On Friday, we visited a friend of my friend's family. My friend, though liberal, collects old firearms, and the guy we visited owns an outdoor range. So we spent some time there firing off different weapons before ""enjoying"" a private, amateur fireworks show.  But the final day was most memorable. Ormond is right on the Atlantic coast, so on the way back, we decided to stop and spend some time on the beach. I've lived in Ohio for most of my life, only moving down to Florida last year. And since I'm in central Florida, I'm not overly close to the ocean. So this was the first time since I was very little that I had seen the ocean. We walked along the beach for a bit and chatted. The conversation wasn't overly memorable, but I found the walk very relaxing and enjoyable. I enjoyed the trip as a whole, but we tried cramming a lot of events in a short period of time, so things got a bit chaotic at points. The beach walk was easily the most relaxing part, and a really nice way to end the weekend. We probably spent an hour and a half or so walking along the beach. Once the sun started going down, we departed. I would be fine writing about this in the future.",33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO
