It was really exhausting it was me and partner were their. It was a eeg that lasted 3 days to determine an illness with me. It was extremely stressful for both of us. They had a lot of hospital staff coming in and out so we did not get a lot of sleep. All in all I got the dianoses I was looking for to be able to treat my condition more properly. They changed some of my medicine so I could feel better and better treat the condition. I'm not sure if it's been better but I can only hope so. It was a really traumatic event and hope i never have to go through it again. I was fortunate enough that I didn't have to stay in the hospital for longer some people were in there for weeks at a time, I couldn't imagine having to be in a hospital for that long and away from home etc. I knew this was going to be important to me because it would allow me to live a more normal life. This disorder has been something i have been struggling for, for awhile now. The hospital staff were extremely friendly during the procedure. They made me feel really comfortable. They also had very private rooms and good food so the stay wasn't that bad.",3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNTU1ORGT,3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNTU1ORGT
