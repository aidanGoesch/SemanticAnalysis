I got rid of my depression. The cure was micro dosing with LSD. It was scary at first. I eventually overcame my fears. I then had a fun time on LSD. I saw pink elephants doing the tango with red giraffes. It was a wild time indeed. This also helped my marriage. I wasn't in a bad mood all the time. I smiled at my wife a lot more. I gave her treats and hugs more often. She loved the affection. She said to me that taking drugs was the best thing that happened to me. I couldn't disagree with that statement. I hope this fends off the depression for as long as I live.",,3VHHR074H436XFKBD56HEQ11R767LA
