I kept to myself a lot of the time. Because of that, I didn't stray far from the nest, so to speak. I couldn't imaging being social with a lot of people. I needed a lot of time to breathe. I needed a lot of time to be in my own space. However, two months ago the new Pokemon movie had come out, and being a huge fan of the series the desire to see it outweighed the anxiety of going. For a long time, I had weighed the pros and cons. I ultimately let my desire win. I wasn't big on movie theaters anyway, but this one was better than the movie theaters I had remembered. Being in such an intimate space with other people who love the game was something special. I was a bit of a loner. Nobody liked Pokemon that were around me, but in this space I felt like myself. I felt like I could be myself. Truly a wonderful experience.",,3VHHR074H436XFKBD56HEQ11XFA7L0
