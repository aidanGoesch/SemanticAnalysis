When I turned around the look on the guys face was sheer terror. I was embarrassed that he made the mistake. I also feel like I could change my hair style now and my clothing as a result. This is a day I will never forget because it changed the way I think of myself. I. would like to represent my myself as a man more as others would perceive me. I am also considering my mannerisms more carefully. It’s I interesting to think that this all could be a coincidence as well and maybe I am overthinking the whole experience.  Is there anything I cold have done differently outside these  changes that could bring me into a more complex version of what a male is considered to represent in our world in this day and age. Has anyone else gone through this and how did they view themselves. Why did the man just walk away after realizing I wasn’t a woman. What does this situation represent for women and how they must feel being hit on? I think I should have said. Something else after they walked away. Im just not sure what I could have said.,,3VHP9MDGRO6Q945BIBBUZZOVUPFFCF
