He was using again so I kicked him out hoping he would go get help. Instead he tried to kill himself and ended up in the ICU following that a month long psychiatric unit stay. So far nothing has changed. I found out he is still using and it makes me very angry. We have a child together that I refuse to let him see until hes sober. I guess its not a priority for him. I'm stressed out doing it all alone. I have no family to help and his child shouldn't have to not have s relationship with her dad because he rather do drugs. I've chalked it up to hes selfish and things will never change. The fact he still tries to lie is the biggest indicator he doesn't have an ounce of empathy for me and for his daughter. I will resent him for the rest of my life, even if he does turn around and stop and step up. The fact is when I needed him moses (NOW) he iant here. I'm doing all the hard work raiding a toddler. If I knew he would be so out if the picture and not give a damn I would have changed many things but I still would want this lovely child.",33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779HHGC8B,
