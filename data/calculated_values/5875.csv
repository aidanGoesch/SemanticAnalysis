I had to take my son to the store to do his back to school shopping. I can't believe my first baby will be going in to Kindergarten so soon. He did have a lot of fun choosing a Minecraft back pack, and some clothes and shoes for school. Buying the school supplies was fun and nostalgia inducing but at the same time I wasn't prepared for the hefty prices. We also went and got his hair cut, he chose a sort of skater style. He looks so cute and handsome and grown up. I think he'll make a lot of friends this year, and grow up even more. I am excited but sad about it. I can't believe it's just coming up here in four weeks. We have so much to do this coming month. I have to go to his orientation, and back to school BBQ. We also have his sixth birthday coming up the same week. It's going to be a busy and emotional time, but I am excited mostly. I can't wait to see how he feels that first day he gets home from school. I'm praying it all goes really well.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDAV7OTW,3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDAV7OTW
