This is not our first child but this pregnancy and deliver were definitely some of the most challenging and difficult. My wife had been in and out of the hospital for monitoring over the prior two weeks due to hyper tension and worries of preeclampsia. This last time she was admitted they decided that they needed to keep her for monitoring. While she was having normal contractions it was noted that our babies hear rate would dip dangerously low with each contraction. This, they suspected, was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babies neck. The contractions were tightening the cord and cutting off some of her air supply. They decided they needed to induce right away. My wife was trying to push the baby out but was having great difficulty and everything was made even more difficult because of the babies heart rate dropping with every attempt. The doctor was getting frustrated and worried that she would not be able to deliver normally and had them prep the OR for an emergency C-section. My wife was adamant that she didn't want a C-section, but the doctor told her they would have to do what is in her and the babies best interests. He then said she had a few more minutes to try herself, and that she really needed to focus. At this point, my wife really tried and after a couple pushes, and some pulling from the doctor with a suction cup, the babies head was visible. The doctor quickly unwrapped the umbilical cord from around the babies neck and my wife finished the delivery of our little girl. The entire labor and delivery process took 45 minutes from start to finish. This was one of the most exciting, scary, happy, and stressful situations in my entire life. I can only imagine how intense it all must have been for my wife.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP
