Which was her pet named pepper a breed of guinea pig. It was quit happiest moment in her life but unexpectedly a flue disease affected her. It was died a few months ago, She could not accept it because she loved her pet a lot. And She buried her cute little pet in her mother's backyard. Because she is not ready to throw her away or put her in a dustbin. All people in her home were very sad much then her. And also I think it would be the biggest loss in here home. She cried a lot and said that she did not considered as a pet she just considered her as a friend to be in her life. She really did not expect this death in her life. After a death of her pet she did not manage her self because she is mentally disturbed. This would never happened in another person's life. She cannot forget that day or a death of her pet in her life days. Because she is too sensitive. She miss her self after this happens. She missed her pet a quite bit. and also she feel that she missed something in her life.",,3VNL7UK1XG57VL7M4X6KO9OZ11GTFC
