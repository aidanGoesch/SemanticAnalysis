I didn't think that this would actually happen to me, but it did. I was told to expect something like this occurring, but I didn't realize that it would actually occur, if that makes sense. You never think this kind of thing would happen to you until it did. I still don't really know how to feel. I don't want to talk to anyone. I don't want to go to school. I don't want to go to work. All I want to do is sit at home and do nothing. Everyone says that life will go on, but it doesn't feel like it. Feels like just yesterday when I was told I was pregnant. I feel like this entire thing went by so fast. From the time I found out to this miscarriage, it was only what? Three weeks, max? It feels like I just blinked and the entire event flew by. I can't believe, again, that this would happen to me. Now I have to face the world without the child growing in my belly. How can I be around other kids? How can I deal with seeing other pregnant women? This is the toughest moment of my life. Since I found out I pregnant, I've thought about it every second of every day - I doubt that that will change.",3VNL7UK1XG57VL7M4X6KO9OZR6TTFP,3VNL7UK1XG57VL7M4X6KO9OZR6TTFP
