I could have never imagined that a silly post on Reddit could turn out to be such a life changing thing. I also could never have imagined all the terrible people it would bring to my doorstep. I wrote the post on Reddit about a terrible date I had been on the night before. Some of it was fiction. Alot of it was exaggeration. I was really just venting and being silly. Apparently it got reposted by several famous pages and all of a sudden everyone knew my name. Things go viral on the internet pretty quickly I guess. I received a few offers for jobs because of my writing skills, which was pretty cool. The worst thing to come out of it thought was Marie. She messaged me with pics of herself and started chatting. I'll admit, she was beautiful. Like really really beautiful. She flirted with me. I played along because who doesn't love a beautiful woman showing them attention. Eventually we met up and I was shocked to see, she was not the woman in the pictures. Maybe she was the same woman when she weighed 200 pounds less and was 15 years younger. The woman who met me was at least 55 years old. She apologized but said she had to lie to me in order to get me to meet her because she needed to ask me for money. The entire situation blew me away. I just got up and walked out. I will never post personal info on the internet again!",,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9CH39VL
