I guess that is an eternity on the internet. I was inundated with offers to review products. I took people up on many of the offers and received lots of cool gadgets. I look forward to reviewing them all over the next month or two. I got so excited I even agreed to meet someone that said they really liked my story. That proved to be a bad mistake. They just wanted to try and steal from me. I know I shouldn't have agreed to meet them but I was just feeling so good about myself at the time. Almost like I was invincible. Pretty silly I guess, but live and learn. Still, out of all the people I came into contact via the internet, most were good and followed through on what they said they were going to do. Just this one person soured me on ever meeting anyone in person that I meet online. Hopefully I can put this incident behind me. I do not want to have a distrusting nature or end up bitter and cynical just because of them.",,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9CH39VL
