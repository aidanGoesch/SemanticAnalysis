I was on my way home from work at a time when it there was really no traffic which surprised me. I had everything done that I needed to accomplish so I could just go home and relax. I was sitting at a light after getting off !-78, this is around 1 pm. As I am sitting there, a car slams right into my back bumper. They obviously were not paying attention. This is an awful spot to get in an accident so we both had to find a way to get to the shoulder. That was a process so it had to be done carefully. After we were done with that, we exchanged insurance information. I was shocked this guy even had insurance to be honest. I was worried I would be sore. I didnt feel stiff or anything which is good. The other guy was also not hurt. My car had some minor damage but his insurance paid for all of it. It really could have been worse.",,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9CZ2V96
