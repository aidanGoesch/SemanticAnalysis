I glanced in the rear view mirror and noticed a truck coming up on me way to fast. I tapped my break lights hoping to get their attention. By the time I looked back at the road, a matter of a couple of seconds the truck had hit me. Surprised I didn't act immediately by pulling over. Then before I could doing anything it struck me again. I looked in the rear view mirror and I could see the person clearly he was that close. What scared me is he looked crazed and I thought what is going on. I could tell that he had no intention of stopping and was going to hit me again. I swerved into the other lane luckily there were no cars in that lane. When I looked in the mirror I saw that he followed me into that lane. I quickly swerved back into the other lane and immediately pulled into a parking lot. He continued to travel across the two on coming traffic lanes and into the cemetery across the road where his truck became lodged on a grave stone. I was so scared that he would get out his truck and come over to my car. There was a Wave cable guy that witnessed the whole thing and pulled in the parking lot too. I felt so much better that he was there in case the other guy did come over. He didn't he was to busy try to get his truck off the grave stone. The police showed up before he could.",3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9CZ2V96,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9CZ2V96
