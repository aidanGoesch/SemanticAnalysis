I've had some great neighbors there for the past 7 months, but they told me when I met them that that was only going to be a temporary place for them.  They were new to the area and just needed a place to live until they could find a home to buy.  They spent a long time looking for a place to call their own and eventually found it in a nearby town.  Even though I know I'll still see them from time to time, it was hard to see them go. After my old neighbors moved out, I wondered who'd move into the house next door.  I didn't have to wait long to find out.  Almost as soon as my old neighbors moved out, a new neighbor moved in, and I went over and introduced myself to her.  She was happy to meet me.  It turns out, we have a lot of things in common and even know some of the same people.  I was relieved because you never know who might move into a rental.  Better yet, this woman plans on staying there until she dies (her words, not mine), so there shouldn't be people coming and going there anymore for some time to come.  My new neighbor is elderly and needed some help moving things into her new home, so I whelped her.  Afterwards, I took some brownies over so she could enjoy a little chocolate after dinner.  She was so happy about that, she went on and on about it.  Then, a few days later, she called me over to her place and told me that she had something she wanted to give me.  It was something I needed for my kitchen which I hadn't been able to find in the stores.  I vaguely remembered mentioning something about it to her, but I was surprised she paid any attention to it and then did something about it.  She saw exactly what I was looking for at a yard sale and purchased it for me.  I offered to reimburse her for it, but she wouldn't let me give her a penny.  She said she was just so thankful to have a good neighbor who was so helpful that she wanted to give it to me as a thank you.  I was deeply touched.  I know we're going to get along great.",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7BBFDHWQ,30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7BBFDHWQ
