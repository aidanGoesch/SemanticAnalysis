I set my appointment for 10:00am and left at 11:00am. When I went they took my weight, blood pressure, and temperature. I thought I was passing a kidney stone; however, I was having a miscarriage!! Wow. I cried when I got the call...haven't even left the facility yet, I cried all day. My boyfriend was really comforting, as always. I couldn't handle knowing the fact that I...lost a baby. I knew I missed my period that month; So what I did was purchase pregnancy tests, went home to take them. Turns out, no pregnancy. So maybe I'm thinking the dental visit, xrayed my fetus away from my uterus. I was thinking about so much!! I was sad. I was angry. I was crying all the way home. I don't need to have a child right now, but I didn't wanna hear THIS news today and whatever. Anyway, that isn't even the end of it. The day before I deposited a fake check into my checkings account, it was a fake check so now I can't even access my bank account. I really hope I don't have to pay my bank back! I got scammed and had a miscarriage all in the same 24 hours!",,3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGU2HGM6Y
