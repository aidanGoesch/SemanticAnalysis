I live at a shelter where you gotta pay 10 bucks to stay which is wierd but it keeps the drug attics out.  I think portland is cool but it has alot of problems,  There are needles everywhere.  There are people talking to themselves everywhere.  The city is ran by a full tard.  The mayor is useless.  The mayor also supports antifa.  I am only gonna be out here for a few more days.  I saved money all summer to get a car.  I will be heading up to bellignham to stay for a few months with my mother.  That will be wierd because she lives with her friend and I do not like her.  I ill stay for two months.  I will be saving a little more.  I will then head out to somewhere new.  I think probably oklahoma.",3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGUUO0M6O,
