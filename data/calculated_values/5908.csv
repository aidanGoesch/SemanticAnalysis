I moved to Portland Oregon which is my home.  I Had  a apartment in Las Vegas which was decently cheap but then I moved to Portland and realized how expensive it is.  I have not been home in nearly 8 years I have been living around the country trying new things and places out.  I came to Portland last month and have been looking for work and using MURK to supplement my income.  I am homeless and living in a shelter but it is still better then living in Las Vegas in a very black neighborhood.  I do have some issues with Portland, one of the big ones is the politics in the city is very liberal and very crybaby.  So as i look for a job and place the more I see the more I think I might change my mind.  I cannot live near liberals they are too weak and allow drug addicts and homeless to control their city.  I think I will look for something else.  I might even move to southern Oregon.  If Oregon is no longer my home so be it.  I might move to the middle of the country to a more conservative area or city.  I cannot do california because I want the immigrants out and they are swarming California.  Lets build a wall and throw them over it.",3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGUUO0M6O,3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGUUO0M6O
