What an honor that was! I felt very blessed to be such an integral part of their special day. It was a beautiful summer wedding and I'm glad it was my first. It was such a lovely experience, but two moments in particular stick out to me. The first is when my best friend, the bride, walked down the aisle. She was stunning! She had her dark hair in an intricate up-do and perfectly done makeup. Her dress was sleeveless, had lots of perfectly placed lace, and fit her like it made especially for me. It was almost as if she walked straight out of a bridal magazine! The groom's expression was so wholesome. He had tears in his eyes and I heard him clear his throat a few times. I got choked up too, seeing him being so in love with my best friend. The second moment was when they exchanged their vows. They chose to write their own. Neither were big writers, but both wrote some of the most beautiful words I have ever heard. Their love for each other really showed. It was hard to keep my composure as the officiant because the moment was so breathtaking. When she asked me to do this, I did not realize how important this moment would feel to me. I simply thought I would be doing them a favor, but it was so much more than that. I was able to join my best friend and the love of her life together in holy matrimony. This is a day I will never forget and will cherish forever.",,3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGUXV9M6E
