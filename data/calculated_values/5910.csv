I met with the couple leading up to the wedding and made sure to go through their wants and wishes in detail. From that I made a list of what to include and not include during the ceremony and began writing a script. Building the script was probably the single most stressful part of this work. I generally have a lot of words. Still, finding the right ones to say proved to be incredibly challenging here. I went through at least five different drafts of the speech before I settled on something that I really loved. This really was a labor of love. At the rehearsal I made significant modifications to the script based on my own experience and understanding of the couple. The initial reaction was incredibly positive. Still, I wanted perfection and went back to the drawing board. On the day of the ceremony I was incredibly excited but nervous. My friend was a wreck and needed a lot of emotional support. As we walked up to the altar together I gave him words of encouragement and got into my speech. It was a beautiful ceremony and something I will never forget. Being able to do this for him is one of the highlights of my life.",,3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGUXV9M6E
