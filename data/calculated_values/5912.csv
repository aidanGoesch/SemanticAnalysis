I get a call from my younger sister asking me to go with her to her doctor's office to get the gender results for her baby as she was about four months pregnant at that time. She was tired after work that day and wanted to know if I minded driving her there. I of course agreed to help. I waited in the car while she went in to get the results and had the idea to contact my best friend whom I hadn't seen in quite some time. He had suggested a month earlier that we should have a coffee date one day. With the work schedule I had at the time, I didn't think we'd get to do that any time soon. However, that day presented the perfect opportunity. I happened to have a decent amount of cash that day and asked my sister if she minded me meeting up with my best friend for coffee after he got off from work. I offered to give her gas money for her time and to keep her gas tank full. She agreed to let me drive to his job to get him. We got there and waited until he was done for the day. This didn't take long yet I was worried she would grow impatient. Luckily, my sister was very calm and relaxed. I forgot that she knows about the history of me and my best friend and how we used to date and still have feelings for each other since she was a kid at the time. Not long after, his work day ends and he comes out of the building. We hugged for a moment before driving to the local coffee shop up the street. He and I go in and order. We sit down and talk for about 45 minutes about everything on our minds. He surprised me by suddenly holding my hand and rubbing it for the majority of the time we were there. I felt so shy yet also warm, relaxed, and safe. We sat there staring at each other for a long moment. I admitted to him that this was the best I'd felt in a long time. Although we don't see each other often, we talk through social media every day. We've both been coping with unfavorable situations and it was like at that moment all our stress evaporated and we found peace in each other's company.",,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQ45M93Z
