It lasted 13 weeks and was not what I was hoping for. I was very disappointed in the quality or care I received there. I feel like they didn't give me the tools I needed to eat the way i should and maintain a healthy lifestyle. I relapsed as soon as I got out. The most memorable experience was when I had to be tube fed. I hated it! It was the most uncomfortable thing I had to endure. The group therapy discussion were not pleasant either. I hate hearing about all of us being messed up in some way. Everyone wanted to get better but it was hard a lot is hid ways to continue our disorder. My roommate hid diuretics and took many of them. another found random hiding places to puke. It was the worst place. I felt like none of the staff wanted to be there and it made it worse when they looked at us with disgust especially during weigh in days.,,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQKXI93V
