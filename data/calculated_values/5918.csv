I decided to work out for 1 hour a day, 3 days a week. Today I just hit a record! During my work out session I was really feeling it. I have been more motivated during my workouts because I have an event to go to in two months where I have to look good. I usually alternate my work out routines. Today was bench pressing. I always document my work outs and what I have accomplished for the day. I hit a record for personal best! Today I successfully lifted 200 lbs for 5 reps! I couldn't believe it! I am usually only able to do 200 lbs for 2 reps, but I tried my best today and it paid off! I am so proud of myself. I really hope I can continue this streak during my next work out. I think I'll be able to do it.",,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQKYB39K
