It started like any other day. I warmed up just like any other day. I hit my mobility exercises like normal, and to be honest, everything felt normal. That is, until I started actually hitting my weights. I got under the bar and started bench pressing. I didn't immediately notice anything unusual. Once things got heavy, I knew I was in for a good workout. I hit a new personal record today. For the first time in my life, I was able to bench press 200 lbs. Not only that, but I was able to do it for 5 full reps. Prior to this, my personal best was 190. I couldn't believe how much better today was than usual. This is proof that my hard work is paying off. I am on my way to getting the look and results I desire!",3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQKYB39K,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQKYB39K
