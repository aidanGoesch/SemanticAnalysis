It quickly got really worse and ended up passing away. It was really sudden and unexpected. I couldn't believe he was gone. Someone that had always been a part of my life was suddenly gone forever. I was beyond devastated. I couldn't believe he was gone and I still can't. I miss him so much every day. It doesn't make any sense. He was fine and then a few weeks later he was gone. He's the first person I lost that I was so close to. I've cried so much since then. Every time I think about him I start to cry. It's hard to believe that he is really gone. I've been having dreams about him every night since he died. It makes it so hard because I always wake up thinking about him because of the dream. I've been having a lot of trouble sleeping because of it.,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQLZS394,
