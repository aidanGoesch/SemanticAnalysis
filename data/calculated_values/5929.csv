It was a sunny day, and we both had the day off of work.  We were sitting on the first level.  We had pretty good seats.  The day was going pretty well.  We were drinking a few beers and having a good time.  I don't know which of the players from the Cubs hit a home run, but when they did, we jumped up in excitement. I lost hold of my beer in the excitement, and it flew and hit the back of this lady sitting in front of me.  It was almost a full beer, and all of it went on her shirt.  She was furious, and I was mortified.  She started screaming at me, and at first I was apologetic.  When she continued to scream at me, I told her to ""Fuck off, I already apologized.  What the fuck else do you want me to do?""  At this point, the guy she was with started getting loud and threatening.  My brother-in-law started jawing back with the guy as well.  Then security started to approach, while we were going back and forth.  When security got there, I explained that it was an accident, and that I was not being drunk or disorderly.  They diffused the situation, and we were able to continue and watch the game.  There were no further disturbances.  We laughed about it after the game, and in hindsight, it was pretty funny, although somewhat unfortunate.",3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C13SXX3,
