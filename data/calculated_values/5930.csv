I just got out of work, and my bro had 2 extra tickets.  He let me invite one of my friends from work.  I don't remember much about the game itself (since I was drinking a lot LOL!), but remember it was an exciting game.  We took turns paying for hot dogs, hot pretzels and beer.  We were pretty loud, and almost got kicked out for spilling a beer on a lady in the row in front of us. After the incident, we decided to move to a different section, since there was a lot of heat on us due to our raucous behavior.  We went to a different section that was further from the field, but had a better view of the Cubs bench.  We continued to drink beers and watch the game.  I even posted a few pictures to my face book account and tweeted about it (but I later deleted the pics, since anyone looking at them could definitely tell that i was pretty drunk!)  It was one of the first times my brother in law took me to a sporting event.  I plan on going back sometime this summer.  It will likely be with the same people, since we had a blast that time.  I'd like to go out of town though.  Maybe an away game.  I think it would be fun to check out other stadiums.",3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C13SXX3,3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C13SXX3
