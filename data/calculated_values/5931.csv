We were trying to get away from the daily drudgery that had become our lives. With one daughter in school and a baby son to meet his needs, we needed to have a break. I like when we can just be together as a family. When it is just us that makes me happy. Our marriage has been a little on the back burner with problems at work and meeting family obligations. We needed time to just put things aside and let ourselves relax. Then when we were together in a calm setting, on the beach, that is, we could discuss what we could do to make things better. We held hands and just watched the waves come in and go back out. We watched seagulls play. Our children stayed by us. Their laughter made us happy. We knew we would still have problems when we left but we had time to just rest and not think about them. I didn't want to bring up those problems but I knew they wouldn't go away. I started to talk about them but my husband said they will still be there when we left. We should enjoy the time together now, he said. I wanted to but my mind kept thinking of how when we left things would be the same. I didn't want that. I said alright maybe later on we can discuss solutions to them. He said that would be fine. He said right now let's enjoy being with our children. We are only down here two days he reminds me. I don't want to spend it thinking about the daily grind back home. We didn't have any big problems waiting for us. For that I was grateful.",,3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C7NZXXK
