He picked me up at my place in the early evening and was a total gentleman about the everything.  Opening car doors for me, making comfortable conversation, and asking me meaningful questions about myself.  Often times guys seem to talk about themselves a lot so this was very different.  Once we arrived at the date location, Top Golf, John quickly paid for the time in the driving range booth and that really stood out to me.  Several times on first dates there has been almost a hesitation about who will pay for what but again, John was a total gentlemen about the whole thing.  We made our way to the driving range and while I was awful at it, and John was really good he still made me feel totally comfortable.  At one point however he did try to do the whole teach me how to swing thing and when i turned around his face was really close to mine.  I couldn't tell if he was looking for a kiss so I turned my head and it was kinda awkward!  He quickly recovered though and went back to golfing.  We had a great time!  Drinking, talking, and me clumsily golfing on a beautiful night.   After a while we were done golfing and went down to the bar and had another drink and an appetizer.  John once again was totally in control while paying which I love.  Once we were done we both agreed that it was time to head home.  John drove me home and when he stopped the car he leaned in to say goodnight and gave me a kiss.  Sometimes this can be really awkward but with John I felt totally at home. Once again, he was a total gentleman and didn't try to escalate into something more but simply said 'I'd love to go on another date with you and hope you have a good rest of your evening.'  I agreed and bid my farewell.  It was a perfect start and here we are five months later in a relationship!",,3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C866XXU
