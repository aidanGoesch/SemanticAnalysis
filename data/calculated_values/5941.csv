It wasn't until I met my significant other years back that I came to this question with an actual answer. Our times have been splendid, we have fallen harder over the past 2 years and 3 months together with plenty of eventful times together. Over the summer it's been quite the lovely one with trips to Disney Land, others to different parts such as Seattle, Los Angeles, etc.  All of them were magnificent times that have paved the way for me to ask her to one day become my wife. After an eventful time at our conventions, a hobby we have involving gaming, comics, anime and more, we opted to go to California for a trip to an event called ""Anime Expo"". She's usually rather excited about this event due to the fact she can dress up as her favorite characters as do most others do as well. It's always a lovely time, the atmosphere is fantastic with all the people having a blast going around to booths, visiting voice actors and checking out merchandise halls. As usual we had quite the lovely time together, spent all of our time dressing up, going out as characters from series such as ""Darker than Black"" and ""My Hero Academia"" with lots of laughs, gifts and food to enjoy. Although we had lots of fun to share with each other I still had in store one more event after all was said and done. Typically we do go out to eat together so on that note we took a bus ride all the way down to a pier to enjoy the area, look around to gaze at the scenery and for me to be able to catch her off guard with a ring in a relatively quiet, calm area. She was completely taken aback from the ring, confused initially then started to cry as most would. Of course she did not expect it in the slightest but was more than happy to oblige with her own ecstatic joy reaching down to grab, hug me completely ignoring the ring as she says, ""Yes!"". Could not have been a happier event of our lives that leads me to the main questions that have bugged me over the years. Why do I live exactly? I live to make those around me happier and to find happiness with myself through others.",3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNFJGXZS,3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNFJGXZS
