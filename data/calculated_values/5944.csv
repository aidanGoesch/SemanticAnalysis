Living in the south it's always been popular among the boys, especially when i was younger before all this technology took over. i was more than happy to oblige, anything to him out of the house right? it was a decent Thursday afternoon, sun shining through the trees, just thousands of beams bounding off the ground. i felt insanely nostalgic, everyone was all smiles and just having a blast talking about they recent week, school, books, games, you name it. It was sudden when we went up the hill ""get some big air dad WOOO"" my son kept saying and who was i to say no? 40, 50, 60, we sped up to it and climbed. and we got air alright! Its not that there was too much, it was the huge mud-hole at the bottom from where it rained the night before. when we landed my front left tire hit it just right and got it stuck just long enough to send us flying. screams, disorientation, glass everywhere and then suddenly its like i woke up upside down. The only thing i could think about was are they okay... i couldn't think about me right now. i look to my right, and behind me and breath a big sigh of relief, they look shaken up but safe. glass in our hair i crawled out the now broken window and helped my family to their feet. We kind of stood there for a few minutes and then, for seemingly no reason, we started to laugh. A chuckle at first and then a roar, it was a birthday my son never would forget, and i'll never forget him telling me how it was ""SO COOL DAD"". Best worst day ever.",,3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNH8QXZI
