We decide to make a day of it and take a few others with us. We head out to a town near us that had this deserted road that people are known to trek on. It was a beautiful day for this, sunny, clouds 80-degree weather, what more could we ask for. About halfway through this road, we encounter a fairly steep embankment that crossed some water. We had to cross it to continue, so one of our passengers get out and try to guide us down this hill. on the road down there were trenches on either side from the tires digging in the mud from the previous rain. We start to head down trying to avoid the left side tire trench as it was the deeper of the two, this proved to be a difficult task as we quickly fell in the hole. Our only option was to ""GUN IT!"" as the person who was guiding us exclaimed. So we did just that, as we did we teetered to the left, we were so deep that our two right-side tires had completely lifted off the ground. We slowly fell to the ground and hit hard if it wasn't for the Jeep's Roll Cage it could've ended up far worse, but we were all fine. But stuck out in Timbuktu. So we had to call a tow truck to get the Jeep out of the ditch, we were they for what felt like hours in direct sunlight before they arrived and got the Jeep back up without a problem. While the bill of paying the tow truck wasn't fun, the day I had spent with my family sure was. Considering that spending quality time with family now is far few and in between, I cherish the memories I do have.",,3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNH8QXZI
