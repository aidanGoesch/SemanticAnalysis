She married her high school sweetheart. I was very proud of them. The marriage ceremony was great. She walked down the hall in a white dress. The man had a great tuxedo on. They kissed and were married that day. The party was very cool. There were steaks for everybody. There was also a big cake to eat. It was very good. They told me that they were expecting a child. I wished them the best. They think it will be a girl but I put a bet that it will be a boy. The bet is only a few bucks. I hope they have a happy life. They are a strong and young couple, so they should live long.",,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FM3J2KRQ
