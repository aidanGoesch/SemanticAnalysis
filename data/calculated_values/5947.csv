We have been friends since we was 7 years old and we are now both 25. Recently Tiara just got married and it was the most happiest day ever. To be apart of such a memorable moment just writing about it makes me so happy. The joy comes from knowing where her and her husband use to be and how far they have came. The love they have grown for each other and to be apart of this wedding and to be apart of a memorable day is amazing. They just go married May 12, 2019 the most gracious and amazing part was to hear their vows. The vows was so heart filled because to be close to them and to see the man her husband has molded into and grown into to be for his family. It just gives you so much happiness. The reception was also amazing her mother passed when we were kids so to see the happiness and memorials for her felt like she was there. We had such a great time we danced all night. The food was amazing and the decorations was just so beautiful her day was fit for a queen. The even better memory is they are expecting their 2nd child which is a soon. So to know they are doing it right this time and grown over the years is everything she deserves. The love in their eyes will always be amazing and a memory for my best friend because she is truly happy.",,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FM3J2KRQ
