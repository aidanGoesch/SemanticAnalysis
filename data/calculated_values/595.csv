I was very hurt and felt depressed for quite some time  after he passed away. He was in the hospital , because he had diabetes and had his leg amputated. He died at an early age, and it was devastating to my family and I. I told myself that I would do my best to avoid getting diabetes by eating healthy, and always exercising. I saw first hand what it can do to a person. I took my father for granted at times because we did not spend as lot of time with each other. I moved out of town and stayed with my partner for months at a time, before I went back to see my parents. I really regret not spending more time with my father, because as I grew up I know we could of got more close. Me and my father were not that close but he always provided for my family. I appreciated him very much and still miss him to this day. A lot of people helped me get through this experience, it made me stronger mentally and physically. I will try to educate other people about diabetes, and the effects of it. I will do my best to help other people out with diabetes. It is very serious and an epidemic around the world.",33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,
