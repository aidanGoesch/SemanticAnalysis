It wasn't really that different from any other day,  I was going to work.  I work most every day, and this one is no different.    I usually don't do anything special after work,  but today I decided to socialize.  I went to a bar.  I talked to people.  There was a woman.  We chatted.  It wasn't anything unusual,  just shatting,  but then she asked me if I wanted to take her home.   And I said yes.   There really wasn't anything meaningful there,  just meaningless sex,  but it was a social connection that I had been lacking for a long time.  I enjoyed it a great deal.   It was passionate,  I was able to open up and show a different side of myself.   It was fun.   Unfortunately, she wasn't really interested in a long term relationship, so it didn't go anywhere.",3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FM9Z7RK4,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FM9Z7RK4
