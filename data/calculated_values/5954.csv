We have joint custody and we have agreed that he can take care of them on weekends. On this particular weekend, I showed up to the house and I already knew something was off. I smelled smoke. We had agreed that while around the kids, my ex was not supposed to ever smoke cigarettes. He had even told me that he quit. When I opened the front door, already furious, I found my ex smoking a cigarette on the couch. My children were nowhere to be found on the first floor. I yelled at him and asked him what he was doing. He said that he was sorry and that he had a really rough day. A rough day does not allow him to smoke a cigarette in the house when my kids are around. We even have in writing in legal documents that he is not allowed to smoke around them. I called the police and they showed up around five minutes later and diffused the situation. My husband had to agree that if he smokes again he will not be allowed to watch my children. It was a good life lesson for my children because they learned that smoking is not good for them and that they should not be around second-hand smoke. They know now that if their dad is smoking again that they can call me and he will not be able to watch them anymore.",,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FMCJARKE
