When this event happened, I used it as a real life lesson of the kind of man that their father is and how, as men, they should never be. They have learned to be more observant of their surroundings and potentially bad situations and ask me about them all the time. I am so thankful of this because the world they are growing up in today has so many new things to understand and face. Im glad they don't have to feel like they are ever facing these things alone. They have learned and grown. I have confidence that they will not be repeats of their fathers behavior. Now, going forward they have a new role model/father figure in their life that shows them how a woman should be treated. He treats me with the upmost respect and honor like all men should. My husband has been an excellent father for my boys and a rock for our family. We all grow together and love together. And now we have a little girl in the mix and I hope to be the perfect role model to her and pray that he never has to experience things that I have. I hope my kids have a better life than I could even imagine. They may be young now, but the future is theirs. look out.",3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FMCJARKE,
