I keep them for the school year to ensure that they get the best education possible. Don't get me wrong, I think every child should have the opportunity to have a father in their life, but seeing as he was abusive towards me I don't believe that HE should be the father in their life. In fact I am happily re-married now and have a beautiful little girl with my current husband. Flash forward to the end of this most recent summer, I was heading to my ex husbands house to pick up my boys. The arrangement had been for them to be picked up at 12 noon. I arrived at said time to pick them up for my ex husband to come outside and tell me that I could not have my boys until later that day because he changed his plans(something of course not communicated to me). I told him that per our agreement we had come upon I was to pick them up by noon and that I was not leaving without me kids. This man then went back inside and slammed the door on my face. Now at this point my boys knew I was there and I could hear them on the other side of the door crying because they wanted to see me and he would not let them. After an hour went by of me knocking on the door and ringing the door bell, I had to get law enforcement involved. Something I never ever wanted my kids to be exposed to or involved in. When law enforcement arrived they went inside to retrieve my kids and escorted us off the property. Thankfully myself and my children left unharmed and I was able to have a conversation about wrong and dangerous situations and when the police should be called. We were able to turn a completely negative experience into a life lesson and I am very grateful for that.",3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FMCJARKE,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FMCJARKE
