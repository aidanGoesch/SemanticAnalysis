It completely broke my heart because I never knew how hard it was going to be not being able to save one of them.  I had picked her up from the shelter along with a mother cat and two kittens.  Those babies did fine and got adopted pretty quickly.  I had renamed the kitten Minnow because she was just so impossibly tiny.  Her mother had been apparently a feral female cat and they had just managed to trap Minnow instead of both.  At the time she was probably all of five weeks.  She seemed healthy when I brought her home and was eating fine but a few weeks later she started losing weight rapidly and going downhill fast.  We tried electrolytes and she perked up for a bit and I had her eating this super high calorie after surgery food they give animals for recovery.  She seemed to be doing well but then I walked in one morning and she was having seizures in her pen.  I called my rescue leader to come help and B took her home to do an IV but it was too late.  We later discovered she had a liver defect and she just wasn't able to get the proteins and fats she needed to survive. It was a terrible situation and my heart still hurts.  I have used this as a learning experience though so going forward I know what to do when these things happen.  I have a little willow doll specifically for her and for the other foster babies I may lose in the future.,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ042QH91,
