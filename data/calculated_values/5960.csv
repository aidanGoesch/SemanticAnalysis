So when we planned on settling down, I was surprised when my parents decided not to agree on our marriage. We tried everything we could to persuade them but they insisted that I wasn't going to marry him. We had planned to get married without my parent's permission. Eloping into the mountains seemed perfect because we love Colorado and it's natural scenery has holds a special place in our hearts. I told three of my close friends about our plans, and asked two of them to be our witness to our 'ceremony. But there was a big surprise given by my hubby and his friends, that they called my parents and got permission from them. That was the biggest surprise and the best gift I could have hoped for. The wedding turned out to be a more successful one with both our parents there. We ended up getting married in Barcelona, in a random secluded spot in Parc del Laberint d'Horta. ""It was very spur of the moment (we planned it in less than a week!)"". Despite and because of everything, I love how we got married anyway. ""It was a beautiful day and perfect for us. I made myself proud. My Dad was so surprise of what the weeding could turned out to, it was a great one.",,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0CQ9H94
