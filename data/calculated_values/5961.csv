That was my wedding. I got exclaimed about it because i have under a love marriage. We got married with our parents permission. Most important event on that day was a surprise gift from my hubby. He gifted me a diamond necklace which was my favorite one. I often asked him to get this when we were in a relationship. And that was comes to on our special occasion. Another important moment was my childhood friend's entry. That was an unexpected entry which was given by her. Because we were fought a long while. And they had conduct a concert that they were dancing,singing and playing more games. That was very funny. And there were most goosebumps which have not forgotten even now. And they planned a big ever dining with my favorite food. It was biggest chance to met my childhood friends. They gave me a very big surprise. They conducted a fun game between me and my hubby. That was enjoyable. We took lot of pics together. Most important thing was my parents permission. Really amazing event. And I swear that would not happen ever in my life.",,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0CQ9H94
