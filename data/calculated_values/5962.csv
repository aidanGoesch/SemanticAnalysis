I decided to visit a place a spent some time as a child in, St. Lucia. When I was a young boy I lived there with my mother and siblings. It has always been a place of significance and nostalgia to me. I decided that I did not want to travel alone. I sought out the services of a professional travel companion. At first I experienced considerable trepidation and ambivalence. Though I have indulged the services of professional sex workers in the past, this was different. My previous encounters had always been rather ephemeral. I had no way of knowing what to expect. I spent weeks carefully setting up appointments and considering my options. I finally decided to travel a very beautiful and professional young lady. The woman I traveled with was quite lovely and made my journey even more pleasurable. We spent some time together on the beach. We even visited an active volcano. She also did not mind that I had my own itinerary. She was very professional and not too needy at all. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed myself and look forward to making similar plans in the future.",3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0EF39H6,
