I think about the how I have no worries as of now but I am still confused. Am I really different from other people, or am I just the same as others. I am thinking in terms of freewill. If you really look at things stop and think for just one minute. Realize and pay attention to what is around you, it's everyone doing the same thing. Trying to understand there place and to live there best life. No matter how many times I try to think that there is more to life than this there really isn't. I tried to fool myself into thinking that we are complicated beings that all strive for different things. Stop and look at the less complicated and just breath, understand one true thing about us all. We are all the same in terms of what we are trying to do in this world, no matter how you put it, the universe revolves around one basic thing. We are all living based on trying to understand our places and live our best lives. Isn't that funny that we do have freewill but we all are still doing the same thing. I laughed when I realized this so every event good or bad in my life leads me back into trying to do the same thing and that's me trying hard to live the best way I can. So in a way  I am trying to express an event such as now and death and loss, but it still leads me back to where I was before and I am still in the exact situation.  So funny how life is and how we overly complicate things, but lets stop that and just realize we are all the same and just try to live our best lives, Life and loss matter, just like me losing my mother, even though content, I still want to live and be happy.",,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0NBA9HE
