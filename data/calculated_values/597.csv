It took me a moment to comprehend what she was saying. She went on to tell me her mother had purchased a vacation package for the two and now her mother wasn't going to be able to go. My sister-in-law really needed a traveling companion and since we got along well and often had fun together I decided to go. It was a very long flight but the time passed quickly since we always found things to talk about. We both love french food and pastry so we made plans to eat whatever we wanted and just have fun. It was a gray rainy day when we arrived but I didn't mind that at all. In fact the rain and dark clouds seemed to make Paris just like I had seen it in so many movies. I was overwhelmed with the different smells, sights and sounds. After we checked into our hotel and freshened up we decided to go immediately to see the Eiffel tower first. It was within walking distance and the rain was just a light drizzle so we grabbed a couple of umbrellas and made our way down the noisy sidewalk in the direction we thought we should be headed. I was beginning to think we had made a wrong turn when suddenly my sister-in-law pointed up ahead and there in the distance I could see the top half of the Eiffel tower silhouetted against the gray sky. It was a lot bigger than I had imagined it would be. As we approached the base of the tower I noticed the age of the construction and I thought of the history that had passed while the beautiful tower had stood gracefully for so long. I stood looking up at the tower in a light drizzle of rain while people made their way here and there with not even a glance toward the tower they were so accustomed to living near. It was a wonderful way to to start our vacation in Paris at the base of the Eiffel tower.",,33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK11MG1C6
