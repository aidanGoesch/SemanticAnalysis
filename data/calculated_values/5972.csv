The price of the surgery is steep and we needed insurance help to cover it. At last it got approved after 3 years of my parents working hard. On may 28th I got the first part of the surgery, which was to implant the electrodes into my brain. The 2nd part of the surgery was putting the pulse generator into my chest a small cut, strangely when I came to it didn't hurt probably because I was on painkillers. I couldn't walk properly and got light headed a lot for the upcoming 2 months had to recover my strength. I'd say it was a good experience, but would not ever do it again. I remember how bored I was during the summer being locked in my room because I couldn't let the sunlight hit my bald head where the surgical cut was. I was really frustrated at the boredom I started reading books. I picked up singing lessons to kill the boredom and strengthen my weaknesses. Weight lifting was on my mind all the time because I love powerlifting. I came back to power lifting 2 months ago and was happy ever since. I love fitness it is my life style now . People often ask me how was the experience and I tell them it was scary at first. I honestly expected to die because I have one of the worst luck in life in my opinion but I'm probably exaggerating it. Overall I think it was an interesting experience. Good to be a test subject for this surgery.",,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0NGC9HQ
