It reminds us of our own youth, in a way. It allows us to be centered. To be more grounded with the aspects of innocence. There was a parade at this local school about three weeks ago that my child was attending. I took pictures of these kids, jovial and excited just to be a part of something. They were between 3 and 5 years old. The age of exploring more of the world but still in that protective bubble of accommodations. Imagine being a kid again. That's a pretty wild concept even for me. It takes time to remind ourselves that part of living is to have fun. It's about enjoying oneself. I took pictures of these kids as well just to remind myself of that too. Innocence shouldn't be totally lost. It should be nurtured.",,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7XFH5VI
