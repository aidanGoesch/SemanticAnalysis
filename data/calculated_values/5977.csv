My little girl was dressed up in white and gold and my wife did her hair.             I decided to move around the gymnasium to capture all I could of what was going on. I snapped pictures of kids eating, kids crying, kids smiling in my camera. And even  kids looking angrily at me. I could see some parents looking about a bit exhausted. And I wondered how many took off work to be with their children, costing them money and time. I met my daughters daughter for the first time and was amazed on how well she got along with my baby girl. And many ways as I spent about 2 hours taking pictures, I am around thinking about my daughter in a new way. How she appears to others. I mean to kids and to parents. She does stand out with curly hair and pale and big black eyes, and it was quite a good first look at how others see her. Unfortunately, it started to rain before the parade could happen. I saw a few disappointed people. It was mostly the parents. My little girl was already asleep.",3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7XFH5VI,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7XFH5VI
