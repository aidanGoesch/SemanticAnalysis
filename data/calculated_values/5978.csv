It was a fun hike. I set up a tent at the entrance of the woods. We both went fishing. I got a big fish. He got a little fish. We both hiked up a hill. We saw the lovely sunset on the hill. He decided to do something unexpected. He proposed to me while the sun was setting. It was very romantic. I said yes and we will get married in December. It will take some time planning the wedding. I hope to look my best when the occasion arises. I hope we both look good at the wedding. I will definitely be sending wedding cards to everybody who is invited.",,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7XFJ5VK
