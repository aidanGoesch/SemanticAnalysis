My boyfriend was planning something I could feel it. He wanted to take me on a hike. The weather was great and we were up for an adventure. I could tell that he was really putting an effort into it. But I didn't really know for sure that he was going to propose. He was mainly taking the day off from work so it was very special to have that time to spend together. Because he is a workaholic, any time off is a blessing. It was only until after the hike was over that he proposed. We were in Yosemite National Park so there were a lot of people there, tourists come from all over the world. So there was a little bit of an audience it felt like. They knew what was going on when he got down on his knees. I was a little embarrassed. I'm not exactly sure why. But regardless it was one of the best days ever!",3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7XFJ5VK,
