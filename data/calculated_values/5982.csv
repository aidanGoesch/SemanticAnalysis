That position is called head cashier. I worked very long and hard to be able to interview and get this position. There was also a favor of this position being open. Finally, a Head Cashier position opened up, and I interviewed for it. Unfortunately I was not the right fit at the time. So I worked even harder and made sure I stood out from the rest. I wanted to show I can do the job. A while later another Head Cashier position opened up. Yet again, I did not get it. At that point I felt worthless. All of my hard work had gone unrecognized. A few weeks later, another one opened up. This time I got the position! I was thrilled. It was finally time to shine!",,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7Y90V5G
