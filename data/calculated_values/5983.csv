We live out in the country so there are always interesting places to go. This one morning I decided to go in to a part of the woods that I never go in to. It was a dense area and I started to get scared. I tried to find my way back but the more I tried the worse it got. I was starting to get nervous. This caused my dogs to feed off my reactions and they started getting nervous too. I was worried that I wasn't going to be able to find my way back. I kept on moving through the forest. Finally I stopped and I could hear cars. I traveled in the direction of the cars. It was a road that I knew. It was about 5 miles from my house.  I followed the road back. I was so thankful to find it.,,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7YA4V5M
