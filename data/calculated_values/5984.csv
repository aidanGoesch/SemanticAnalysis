Everything was going to be fine or so I thought.. Turns out, walking your dogs in the woods can be far more than you expected. In reality, this walk in the woods turned out to be a 2 1/2 hour endeavor. How could a seemingly innocent walk in the woods with your fur family members become an elongated process? Well.., when you decide to check out new paths and different areas you can REALLY become lost in the woods. Trees start to become the same, especially here in the Maine where we are called ""The Pine Tree State"". That's really all you see-- pine trees mixed with scant hardwood forest species (once pine trees take over an area the forest floor soil becomes acidic making it harder for other trees to propagate) and patches of shrubs in open areas. Where I live in particular is hilly and did I mention has many trees? I eventually found myself in new territory with my dogs, and confused about which direction home was in. This confusion kept hitting me for about an hour and a half, walking back and forth continuously coming back to an area. The final time I came back to this area in the woods, I noticed something unusual, numerous letter 'P's or '9's hanging from small tree branches, made of felt material. It was very odd to see, as there were at least a dozen or more hanging in this small area off these one or two trees and their numerous small branches. I immediately took that as a sign from where I was standing in relation to these letters/numbers, I had to go in the westerly direction. After walking for what felt like an eternity, my dogs and I finally noticed familiar territory! We were approaching our home, and made it home safe despite being dehydrated and wiped out (covered in ticks no less). In essence walking in the woods with your dogs can be fine and dandy as long as you bring your phone with a GPS app (I use Gaia GPS) and do not encourage yourself and your poor English bulldogs to go further and further in. Thank God.",3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7YA4V5M,
