They are about mid-aged dogs still capable of going on walks, except our male bulldog has some breathing issues. He is always rearin' to go and was ecstatic to take a walk in unfamiliar territory (they hadn't gone on walks in our woods before). We were walking in the woods going on what I thought was going to be a casual, twenty to thirty minute walk at most. I was certain Ralphie (Breathing problem dog) and KC could handle it. That thought quickly went out the window as went deeper into the woods into unfamiliar territory that I did not know about. What I thought was the right way back seemed to lead to more confusion with trees galore, and streams surrounding us. ""This does not seem right at all. Where are we?"" I kept saying to myself mentally, and occasionally to the two furry friends I had right next to me. The only difference this time is they were panting and breathing heavy. Their movements were slowed, at this point I was getting nervous.. I did not know how long we were in the woods, wandering around with me trying to use my intuition and internal sense of direction. Starting to become fearful, I received a sign that I never thought was possible. In the trees next to me where ""P""'s or ""9""'s made of felt. They were hanging off random tree branches and it seemed so out of place. I immediately thought ""Maybe this is a sign from God and the angels about how to get home?"" I thought to myself that this must mean I have to go back to the 9'oclock direction, aka to the left. Half an hour of walking later (or so it seemed) and with my dogs nearing the end span of their endurance with their movements very slowed and heavy breathing, there was hope! We were nearing familiar territory getting closer to our home! ""Almost there!"" I kept telling my dogs and myself. Ralphie and KC were exhausted! I was fearful, but filled with hope. We cleared through the woods and finally reached our destination -- home sweet home! I picked at least a dozen ticks off each dog and got a minor scalding from my stepdad about taking them for long walks. Not my intention, but that day I know I had divine help from God and the beautiful angels. This was a blessing!",3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7YA4V5M,3W92K5RLWV3U6GIM3GTQ3FL7YA4V5M
