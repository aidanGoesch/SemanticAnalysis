I live about 20 minutes away from The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa, FL. The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt. I will forever remember this day, as it changed my life.",3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKB8MU75,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKB8MU75
