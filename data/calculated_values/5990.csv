It was just me and one of my grandsons. He lives near by and wanted to have a last adventure before he started back to school. He is 14, and started high school a few weeks ago. We drove to the mountains and hiked another mile into the forest where we set up our camp. He set up the tent while I got a fire going. We brought tin foil dinners and cooked them in the fire that evening. We started to roast marshmallows just as it started raining. We retired to the tent where we talked and listened to the rain until we fell asleep. During the night we heard a bear nearby so that was exciting. In the morning we had bacon and powdered eggs and packed up camp. We hiked back to my truck, and stopped to get some firewood on the way home. I felt very happy to bond with him on this fun camping trip. We can’t wait to do it again. It was something special I won’t forget.",,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKCV4U7Y
