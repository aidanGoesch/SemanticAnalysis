It showed that  he considered me close enough to the family to be one of the people that he would want to attend the funeral. I had quit the firm a year before and I had worried that my boss had harbored ill feelings towards me but him notifying me about the funeral made me realize that he will always hold a special place in his heart for me and it will be the same for me. I had worked for him for over 20 years and I learned so much from him. He's an intelligent, caring, and ethical person and I was lucky to have him as a mentor.  He always trusted me to do my work and gave me so much latitude. He made me a partner in the firm and would always tell me how much he appreciated my work. He made sure my 401k was well funded and that started me on a course towards saving a good amount for my retirement. I will always appreciate the fact that the job made me financially secure. We had our disagreements but we will always be close. I realized how silly I had been to worry that he had bad feelings towards me after I had left the firm. I should have realized that the years of working together and mutual affection would not change. He had Parkinson's and his mobility is reduced so I am thinking about visiting him in Florida sometime soon. I haven't seen him in over a year and his wife's passing made me realize how little time we have left and I should visit him soon. It will be nice to reminisce about the company and gossip about our coworkers.",3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKDXHU7G,
