I was walking home from my job as a bank teller at the local bank when the most horrible thing happened that I am still afraid to talk about, let alone write about.  I was about 3 blocks from my house when I was accosted by a group of very angry and aggressive black youths.   This is a rough part of my neighborhood so I was used to some aggressive behavior being a white male in a majority minority area but this day was different.  They were obviously inebriated and out for blood this evening.  The leader of the group approached me and called me all sorts of vile, racist names and asked me what the hell I was doing in their neighborhood.  I tried to reason with them but I could tell their as no appeasing them.  I still held onto hope I could get out of this situation unscathed until I was broadsided upside my head with a bottle. This was only the beginning of my nightmare.  I was than kicked and punched until blood was pouring down my face.  All I could do was curl in a ball and pray that it would end quickly.  I had little hope as they were too many and everyone wanted a turn on me.  Before I lost consciousnesses, one of the little bastards ripped my wallet out of my pants ripping the pocket and than spat upon me.  I wish this was the end but unfortunately no, they than proceeded to strip me naked.  After this I was hit with a heavy object and everything went completely dark. I awoke in the hospital with my fiance and mother crying.  I learned that my face was permanently disfigured and that I would need years of plastic surgery.  I now have and suffer daily from PTSD.  I am an agoraphobic and do not want to leave the house.  Because of this and my horrible disfigurement I believe my fiance wants to leave me.  Now, my only thoughts are concerned with revenge!!!",,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKMR47UD
