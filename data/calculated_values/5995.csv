I was walking through a predominantly black neighborhood, when I was attacked by a pack of 15-20 young black males. They knocked me to the ground and kicked and punched me. They stole my backpack, my phone, my laptop, my wallet, my keys, etc. They then stripped my pants off, and left me bloody, naked from the waist down, and unconscious. At some point, the police and EMTs arrived and I was taken to tge hospital. I remained in a medically induced coma for 5 weeks. I didn't get released from the hospital until 3 weeks ago. The police did not make any arrests, and refused to investigate it as a ""hate crime"" because they said that I was wrong to walk through that part of town, and I should've known it was dangerous. It was on local tv and in the newspaper, yet never once was it reported as a hate crime. I am not 100% better yet. I am bitter and angry. I am scared to walk home from work. I now carry a firearm that I do not have a permit for, because I am terrified of those people now. I wish I would have taken a cab instead of walking home from work.",,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKMR47UD
