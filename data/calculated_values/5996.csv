My previous career was going no where and I was stuck in a rut. That's when I saw a commercial for real estate agents. I felt like my mind was open. Why work for someone else when I can be my own boss? I called the number and got all the info. I went to the classes and learned all the tricks of the trade. I got my license and became an official agent. It's a big change for me. I have more freedom now but I also have more risk. I can work all day and night and not get paid for it if I don't make a sale. I'm so nervous because I can easily lose money doing this. I feel like it's worth it though. I finally have the pressure I need to push me far in life. I feel like this is the first step towards real success.,,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKMSK7UV
