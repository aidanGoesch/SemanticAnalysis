We only briefly met our neighbors.  There was a massive storm and the power went out due.  After about 12 hours we realized this was a big thing and that the power might not go back on for some time.  It turned out that is was out for several days. Our neighbors put a generator and note on our driveway so that we could power our refrigerator and not lose all the food.  They didnt even know us.  Tthey reached out and shared their resources when we were all in a time of need.  It was incredibly emotional for my family and I because we were feeling defeated being so new to the area and not having power and just in a slump.  Their offering and good deed made our day. It made us want to help others by paying it forward. I realized how good some people are.  There is just as much good as there is evil in this world.  Some people really do care about others.  Even when they get nothing in return.,3WETL7AQWUUAU7G3J6NKKKTO0FV53Q,
