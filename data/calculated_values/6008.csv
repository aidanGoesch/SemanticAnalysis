I was overweight and needed to make a change. The main issues I was having was that my breathing was starting to get harder and I couldn't walk distances. I noticed that when I would walk to get the mail or something like that, which isn't far, I would get winded. I ended up deciding to take small steps to help lose the weight. I stopped with the cokes first. I noticed that I consumed a lot of them in a short span of time and the calories for them wasn't worth it at all. So after I stopped drinking them, I noticed that I felt better and started to lose some weight. I made other changes after that as well, I started to pick healthier foods and drink more water. After a while, I had lost 80 pounds and started to walk as well. The weight came off in a slow but steady manner and I was proud of myself. Sadly, no one noticed that I had lost weight. The people around me didn't notice at all. I was waiting for someone, anyone to bring up how proud they were of me but no one ever did. Not even my own mother or father brought it up, despite seeing me and knowing that I am making changes with food. One day, I went out with my friend and they asked if I had lost some weight. I was taken aback that someone noticed and told them about the whole thing. It was really nice to have someone notice!",3WEV0KO0ONE9I1GBOR64Q4PSBIZSD2,
