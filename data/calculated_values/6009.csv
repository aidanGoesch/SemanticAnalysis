I feel good about life and everything else. It was a little while ago that someone noticed. Up until that point, no one really cared or noticed what work I was doing and putting in. It had been 80 pounds worth off my body and not a peep! Anyway, I had been with family and friends that day and after the get together, my friend took me to the side and asked me ""Have you lost weight?"" and I said that I had been. She asked me how much and I told her it was around 80 pounds. At that time, I had lost 85ish but it goes from 80 to 85 since I am at a plateau right now. She had told me she had noticed but didn't want to bring it up. She didn't want to offend me! She said she noticed that I ate more healthy things today and that was a sign to her that I was losing weight. I told her I was and it felt good that someone actually noticed and cared! I never imagined that someone would have noticed. It had been way too long since someone had before this. I assumed no one would have.",3WEV0KO0ONE9I1GBOR64Q4PSBIZSD2,3WEV0KO0ONE9I1GBOR64Q4PSBIZSD2
