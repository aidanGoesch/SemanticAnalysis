Sadly my daughter's room is too small for him. We needed him to go in there for the night. Didn't want him bothering me and the wife. I tried to convince him with treats. He wouldn't listen to me and just go in there. I tried to talking to him about it. He wouldn't listen to me at all. I tried to pet him and be sweet to him but no matter what I did he had no interest in go in there. Finally I decided to just force him to go in there. He was so freaked out. I felt bad about it. He was crying about it and was looking at me all mad. He ended up tackling me. My wife laughed at both of us over it. I guess he's not going to go in there anymore.,,3WI0P0II62EXHMGY926Z0UKWHALDRK
