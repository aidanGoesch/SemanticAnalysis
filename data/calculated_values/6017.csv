He found out that I still lived here locally so he got in contact with me.  I received a phone call from him and we chatted for about an hour.  It had been a long time since I had seen him, at least going back to our high school days.  He went off with the military and I stayed here and worked locally.  When we met up for lunch it was like we had never separated.  We really hit it off.  He actually had a family now (after multiple divorces though I'm told).  When our meeting was finished we told each other that we should keep in contact more often.  We agreed to call each other at least once a month as to not drift apart again.  We also promised each other that we would visit during the holidays because he said that he was in the area most years to visit his family.  I felt really good that one of my best friends growing up was doing well.  Its nice having him as a part of my life again.  We call each other all the time now just to keep current on each other's lives.  In a few weeks I'm going out there to see him.  I'll finally get to meet his family and see where he lives.",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHL99OA8I,
