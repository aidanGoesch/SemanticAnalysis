I paid everyone drinks and set some money aside for repairing my truck. I still play every once in a while with mixed results. My strategy is to know when to cut my losses and stop playing. The day I won that jackpot I had not reached that level yet, as it was with my first dollar that I won. I was really impressed when the machine had all of a kind, making me win the jackpot. Because I bought everyone drinks that day, some bonds have been established with other gamblers. I have made new friends on the gambling machines. There is a lady who is always there present who asks me how I am doing on the machines and gets glad when I win. This may all seem trivial, but where I live there is honestly not much to do other than spend time drinking and gambling or go to church. These are the main forms of entertainment and socialization. I see playing at the slot machines as a form of entertainment and a little escape from life's problems. Since that day, I have won some small jackpots but nothing big, so I have not bought everyone drinks with my jackpots since then. Still, I think that being generous and sharing with others when I win very comforting and generates bonds with people who I have probably not met if I did not go there and play. Even when gambling seems to be a risky move, compared to going to church, going every once in a while to this bar and playing the slot machines seems to be a good way to make connections and meet new people. Although gambling may be a vice, as with all things, if done with moderation and with the intention to make new friends and connections instead of looking it as a means to make a quick buck seems to be the best approach. I wish there were better success stories for me with more impact, but still it's nice to see that I can make new friends and establish bonds with something as trivial as playing the slot machines.",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLFP2A8Y,
