He was abusive mentally, physically and emotionally. After the previously mentioned scenario, he moved out of state to ""find himself"". He took all of my belongings, ensuring me that he would come back for me when he was ready to start again with me. I found out that he was cheating on me then in a new state with someone else. He had left me in an empty home; all that I had was a mattress, a couch, and a TV. Everything that I had owned was in a different state with him. I had experienced immense self hatred for being with him and believing that he would change, even just for himself.  I had drank every night I could afford to. When dark thoughts would enter my mentality, I would take Valium to put me to sleep. I self-harmed myself because I wanted to feel something other than the pain I was feeling. I could barely afford to live where I was by myself, so I had a girl friend move in. It was the best decision, especially since my mental health was at risk. I worked 3 jobs in total to help pay bills, and I still couldn't really afford groceries. When I say I invested in my last relationship, I did. I had nothing left. I was spiraling out f control, and wanted to cease to exist. A few months had passed and I regain my sense of self again. Of course, my ex contacted me crying, begging for me to be with him again. I had already started going on dates, and getting back to hobbies that I had stopped entertaining because of him. I proudly said no. I could never let myself reach that dark place again. I was not happy with him, and I had not seen it clearly until he left me all alone. Through hardship I persevered. Why would I return to misery, just because he loved my company?",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLGDM8AT,
