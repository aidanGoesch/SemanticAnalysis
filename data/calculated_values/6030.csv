The waterfall near the entrance to the cave itself, as we walked down the stairs, tinkled musically.  A rich earthy smell, pleasant and verdant, filled the air around us.  We went through the entrance area and entered into the cave opening itself. The ceiling is low here and some people had to duck.  We followed the guide along a paved path that was very easy to walk along, past some interpretive signs about the animals that live near the cave's entrance.  There was a notation that no animals live within the cave itself.  The guide slowly walked us into a larger chamber of the cave and using a flashlight, directed everyone to a metal railing.  We were asked to firmly grab the rail and once he confirmed that everyone was holding the rail, he turned his light off, plunging us into complete darkness. Then the guide said, ""Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to The Mammoth Cave,"" and flipped on the brighter tour lights.  Suddenly, before our eyes we realized we were standing in an immense cavern that stretched out beyond where the light touched.  Many people gasped in delight and awe as they took in the scope and size of this wondrous place. My daughter turned to me with sparkling eyes and breathed, ""It's so beautiful! I had no idea a cave could be this big!""  I too, was stunned at the size, having been in many caves and thinking of them as low, tight places.  Our whole group listened to the guide as he told of the cave's discovery, how people mined for saltpeter here during the American Civil War, how a doctor thought the cave air could cure tuberculosis patients and brought them here in the hopes they would recover.  We saw the places where a preacher gave sermons and where visitors marked their names on the roof of the cave with candle soot. Visiting the Mammoth Cave was an experience that taught me so much.  I have told many people that visiting this cave is something they shouldn't miss the opportunity to do.",,3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLQAQ8A1
