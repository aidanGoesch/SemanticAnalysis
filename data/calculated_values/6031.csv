I went with several family member. We decided to hike the top of Mt. Leconte. It was a fun experience. My father got some brown boots and brown pants for the hike. My mother dressed in all black. My brothers and sisters decided to dress in all white. It was a big adventure. There was a panic at one point. My brother slipped in the middle of the hike. I thought he might of gotten injured. He only got a small scrape and we continued on. It took a few hours to reach the top. We celebrated with a big picnic. It was a feast of some chicken and apple pies.",,3WJEQKOXA9OBQAE5RY0I42UD0PBA14
