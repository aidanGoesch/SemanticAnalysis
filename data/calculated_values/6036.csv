About four months ago I left my childhood home to go to the university I has always hoped I would attend.  It was across the state, and I would be moving out and living in an apartment with complete strangers.  This was scary to me because I am an introvert and it is hard for me to reach out and make new friends.  I knew I would miss my family a ton and my younger siblings were going to miss me.  I shed a few tears that day that I packed my bags into the car, and so did my family.  But I knew this wasn't a goodbye forever, it was just a change in my life, a normal change that many people go through.  I felt excited and nervous at the same time.  I hopped into my car and said my final goodbyes and started the 4 hour drive to my new home.  My heart started racing as I drove and was left to the pounding thoughts of my brain.  I had so many ""what ifs"" scenarios rushing through my brain.  The anxiety started to take hold.  Finally, I arrived at my new apartment.  I opened the door and a familiar face greeted me!  It was my cousin who lived across the country.  I had no idea she was going to the same university as me.  We hadn't seen each other in several years. At that moment, I felt calm.  I knew that this was going to be a great year.",,3WJEQKOXA9OBQAE5RY0I42UDC4S1AI
