The mountains and the air felt so much nicer than the city I came from. We live really near the beach too so that is great. We brought our kayaks and I am really excited to get out and try them out. Everything here is slightly more expensive but jobs seem to pay more so that helps a lot.  But ever since we got here I have been missing my friends a lot. Everyone is so far away and I don't have anyone to hang out with. I still keep in contact with everyone but its just not the same as getting to go out and hang out with them everyday. I was feeling slightly down about the situation so I started looking around on Reddit to see how everyone else meets up with new people. I read about how everyone has a meetup around the area and decided to just go through with and check it out. At first I thought it would be awkward but it was actually really nice and everyone was super friendly and cool. I have made quite a few friends now and we go out to do stuff almost weekly. I really think a few of them could be some of the best friends I have ever had. I cant believe how easy it was to actually meet people.  Now I am feeling alot better about my situation. I think I can enjoy my time here more now and have some fun.,,33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS4GSXI
