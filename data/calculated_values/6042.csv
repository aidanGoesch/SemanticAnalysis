This occurred on December 15th 2018, and although occurred during the month of December, it turned out to be a very nice day. The day actually had me starting out alone since my wife to be spent the night at her parents house for an early day of getting prepared. I feel like the day flew by and before I knew it, it was over. The morning hours saw me and my groomsmen preparing for the big day and also had pictures being taken on both sides while preparing. The limo arrived to pick us up in the AM hours and then it was off for pre wedding pictures at a local park, where I would see my wife to be for the first time. Once we had all the photos we requested, it was off to church for the ceremony and services. Even this part of the day seemed to fly by. I would have never guessed that this day would move this quick since it was such a lead up to it. Once more photos were taken at the church and with extended family, it was off to our reception at a local country club. Everything was decorated perfectly and it was a nice winter/Christmas theme. After more pictures with the wedding party at this venue, the night was set to begin with introductions and the rest of the festivities. Cake cutting, dancing, and dinners rounded out the night for everyone that attended. This part of the night seemed to go even quicker than the rest of day. What a 5 hour event, seemed to be over in the blink of an eye. Everyone that we spoke to said how wonderful it was and how memorable it would be. I think it went off without a hitch and ended up being a big success.",3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RM04VH26,
