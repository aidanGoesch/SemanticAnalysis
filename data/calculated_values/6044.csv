I couldn't sleep the night before our court date and neither could Sandy.  We sat up most of the night asking ourselves will we be good parents, will she love us, will she be happy, our minds were simply a blur.  Our alarm went off at 6 AM that morning but we were up before then having some coffee since neither of us could really eat that morning.   Once we arrived at the courthouse we sat in the car for about 15 minutes still asking ourselves are we doing the right thing, will we be able to give her the best life possible.  We went in and saw her in the hallway before court, I knelt down with outstretched arms and she ran and jumped at me and squeezed my neck so tight it hurt, but it was such a good hurt and I will remember it all my life.   We weren't allowed to go into the courtroom when the judge talked to her, only a few people were there so she wouldn't be intimidated or afraid.  They said she was such a bright and articulate child and knew exactly what she wanted.  We were then brought into court, our niece was not there as the judge talked to us.  I have to say that my emotions got the best of me and at some point I cried like a baby.  I think I told the judge our biggest fear was not being the best we could be for our niece at which point I can remember the judge saying ""From what I see your love for her will take you through all the hard times as well as make many great times together"".  We were told then that the adoption was final and we could now take her home, to her new home, ours.  On our way home we stopped by our local bakery to pick up a cake for the celebration that we had planned.  Our niece waited in the car with me while my wife ran in to pick up the cake and my niece asked me if there was a chance she could get a puppy.  We knew how much she loved dogs since my sister, her mother, had one before she passed and my niece pretty much grew up with a dog around her.  We wanted it to be a surprise and had a little cocker spaniel puppy waiting for her when she got home, her new home, ours.",,3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RMH3EH24
