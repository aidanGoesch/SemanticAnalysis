We adopted my niece so we could be her forever home. It was August 14 2019. She has lived with us for two years. Me my husband and her knew this would be forever long before we went to court.  Yet  it was still a significant day. It was truly bitter-sweet. While all of us were overwhelmed that she would be able to stay with us forever her parents also had to verbally give up their rights to the sweet girl which was painful for us all to hear. Even though it was best for all involved. After we had all signed on the dotted line the judge came and gave us all hugs. She said this is a new beginning even though it was painful and rough to get to this point. She gave my niece a teddy bear. So  she could always remember this day and how it was an important day for all of us. She had a new family that promised to take care of her and love her and keep her safe.  Even tough she didn't always feel like people had done that for her before.,,3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RMH3EH24
