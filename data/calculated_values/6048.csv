You think you know yourself. But do you really? I had always considered myself a dog person. I have been fond of dogs and puppies ever since i was a child. I always wanted one. I never got around to getting a dog though. However, this idea persisted in my head always. People always categorize you. You should either be a dog person or a cat person. Since i liked dogs, i always thought i disliked cats. I was proven terribly wrong today. I adopted a tiny little kitten from the local shelter. I fell in love with her the moment i saw her. I named her ""bella"" and now she is my best friend! Who knew? I am really a cat person, not a dog person.",,3WMINLGALCPVDDO37VP2LYD45GMAC3
