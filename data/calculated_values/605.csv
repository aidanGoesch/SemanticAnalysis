Moving to California was a really difficult decision.  I'd lived in Washington DC for the last 10 years, and all my friends and family are there, or on the East Coast.  I originally moved to Malibu, and, though it was beautiful, I felt isolated and really missed my friends and family.  I was really surprised at how unhappy I felt.  Then I moved to West Hollywood and was closer to some of the friends I had made in college who lived out there. Though the weather was beautiful, I often felt lonely.  A few months ago I joined a MeetUp group for new people living in LA.  Thorough it I've made some really great friends, and really realize how important connection in in life.  I've come to realize that it really isn't where you live that makes a person happy, it is the people you're with.  I've since also reconnected with friends I'd lost contact with from college, and even from high school.  Now that I have friends out here, I feel so much happier, and am able to enjoy the great weather and the beach.  Though I miss my friends on the East Coast tremendously, I don't think I could ever move back.  This was a huge life change, but it was always a dream to live in California.  I'm proud of myself for making this dream come true.",,33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS4GSXI
