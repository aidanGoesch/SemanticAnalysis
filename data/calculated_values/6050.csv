Thee months ago was the start of the truth but the story is even older by another four years. Our relationship was a long distance one spanning an entire ocean, time zones were a constant challenge but somehow it always worked. I was a college graduate with a Masters in Bio Engineering and se was a post grad working towards a career in medicine. We would speak twice minimum every week for at least ninety minutes and spend two weeks together twice a year, once in my hometown and once in hers. Most of the four years went on without a hitch but I could tell in the fourth things were changing a bit. Our phone calls became slightly shorter and a bit less detailed. We missed a few of our annual get togethers, we were pulling back a bit. I decided then that is was now time to make an extra effort to close that wide ocean separating us and took a dive. It took a great deal of effort and deep discussions with he in the six months leading to the wedding but still there was something off.  The wedding planning was smooth and very little went wrong. The week of the wedding or families were together and getting along well. The day of the wedding was perfect and we both agree we wouldn't want anything different. We opted out of a traditional honeymoon, well it was already a big logistical debacle anyway. Excited to begin our life we discussed our future and for me living away from my home that I have known for so long. Thats when I leaned the truth, she was not amazing. She was not a post grad student working towards a medical degree. She was once but not now, she is not amazing in that sense but she is my beautiful and loving wife. I am happy to say that together we have rekindled her excitement of achieving her dream of medicine and i will one day be married to a beast loving SUPER Amazing woman.",,3WMINLGALCPVDDO37VP2LYD4GZ1ACV
