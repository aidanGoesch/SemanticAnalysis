It's not a happy tale.  But it is memorable for it was the day my beloved dog died.  I was doing everything I could for him.  Yet, his 20 year old body just didn't want to go on.  It couldn't defy time I guess.  I carried his emaciated body to the tub to wash him a few times a day.  I fed him through a syringe a few times each day.  I gave him intravenous fluids.  I gave him supplements.  At times he'd seem to come back to life a bit.  To be his former self.  The dog I'd spent more than half my life with, through ups and down and everything.  How could my rock, my best friend ever, be leaving me like this?  What could I have done differently?  I made him the best meals I could, taking time for each and every ingredient to cook just right for him.  I cuddled him and loved him all I could for years.  I went everywhere with him.  You don't just leave somebody you're so connected to like that.  You don't just get sick one day and stoop eating.  Just before the moment of his passing, I went to give him his lunch.  As he took his last breath, I sat there helpless.  Part of my soul, gone forever.  One never forgets one's soul.",3WMOAN2SRCJYW5OS7GPCXWLTGTVNVI,3WMOAN2SRCJYW5OS7GPCXWLTGTVNVI
