Having grown up in small city in Texas, the heart of football country, I was familiar with boys like him. It was just my luck to have moved over a thousand miles away and still fall for someone who would have been at ease growing up in my hometown. I enjoy a good football game, but I'm not the type to go out to the stadium every Sunday. And with our home team spending the last several seasons, guarding the bottom of the standings, I made it clear that I would only go to games on a special occasions.  Having lived with my boyfriend for over a year and half, I could feel when something in our routine seemed to shift. I noticed he was on the phone more with his best friend. He normally took his calls in his little office/man cave, rarely closing the door. In fact, I'm more likely to close it when he gets too noisy. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself. So many times I walked by his office and would be completely oblivious to what he was talking about. But this time a few weeks ago, I heard him say, ""That ring is going to be perfect."" And that stopped me right in my tracks. Unfortunately those words were at the end of his conversation.  I back tracked to his office and tried to get some more information from him, but he would only say that he was ""just"" talking to his best friend. Sensing I was going to get anything else out of him with letting on that I may know something, I retreated from his office. I really didn't know how to feel at that moment. We both love each other and there were no real issues between the two us. It was just marriage was not something we'd spoke about yet. A little while later, I was in the kitchen making a smoothie for lunch, when he came strolling in. He seemed a bit nervous (or excited, still really can't figure which it was). He asked me if we had any plans the following Sunday. After confirming on our day-planner that we were free, he said to block the day for a football game. I readily agreed. Fast forward to the game and me watching his best friend propose to his girlfriend of 3 months at half-time.",,33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS6UXS5
