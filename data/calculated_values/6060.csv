I was surprised when I actually talked to her. I found out she is knowledgeable about many different things. I like when people don't follow a stereotype. I found out later she was interested in talking to me more. We talked on the phones many times after that. We even went on a date. I realized how beautiful she was after she proved me wrong. I also find her open minded. I assumed her to be very leftist. She wasn't shes more middle ground. I also had forgotten she's originally from Germany. We even talked in the mornings on her drive to work. She said it was a boring drive otherwise. We have sense become good friends.,3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8L8DO07,
