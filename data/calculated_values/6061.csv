I saw a man that might be described as a ""thug"" by modern day society. It began raining. The old woman was getting wet and had bad mobility. The ""thug"" had an umbrella and opened it. I was surprised and touched to see that he didn't open the umbrella for himself. He held the open umbrella over the old woman. He was the one getting wet. This defied stereotypes and modern day expectations simply based on how the man looked, dressed, etc. Any other person might expect the man to rob the old lady at gunpoint. He could of only simply cared about himself. Instead he defied these judgmental stereotypes expected by society. In society's defense I don't see things like this everyday. That makes it even more memorable. This is something I feel the world needs more of.",3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8L8DO07,3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8L8DO07
