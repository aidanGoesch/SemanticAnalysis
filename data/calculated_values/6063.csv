I looked up some helpful practices and I stumbled (pun intended) across walking meditation.  As I read the description of the exercise/practice, I realized this is something he actually do on a regular basis.  He lives very close to a he lives in a very nice subdivision with lots of nature around him also there is a forest preserve with a walking path. I have gone down it many times and it is just a wonderful way to connect with nature I think this would be great outlet for him to release some of his stress.  After I made the suggestion to him he was very excited about what that could do for him and so it could help him saying anxiety.  When he weather permits, he typically like to take a walk or ride his bike through some trails in the woods at his house; He generally focuses on the wind and the temperatures of the breeze, the ambient noises coming from the trees, and he particularly likes the warmth of the sun and the way it shines through the trees.  One day, he was walking down the path and and saw two deer standing in the way.  One ran away the other just kind of stood there and looked at him for a short period of time.  He was startled for a few seconds and then figured he was not going to be harmed. The deer found an it apple on the side of the path, bit down on it and then took off into the woods.  He said this was a wonderful serene moment and he felt that he was very connected with nature Either way, he explained he always feel a bit more relaxed and content afterwards.  I'm glad this is a remedy for his anxiety. I'm sure that there are other opportunities in his life feel an inner sense of peace from doing this type of meditation. The feedback has been very positive and I may start doing it myself.",,3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC
