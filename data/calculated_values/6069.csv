San Diego always felt relatively close to where we live, but after spending long, grueling hours in a minivan with my entire family, I now know better. Writing about it this way makes the trip seem worse than it really was. Despite spending what seemed like an eternity cramped into a small space with the people who know how to get on your nerves better than anyone else, the experience was something that I'll always cherish. It's only been 5 months since we've come back and the memories of our time at Sea World are just as fresh and vivid as if we had only returned yesterday. I can still smell the different exhibits clearly. I've never been a fan of seeing animals in captivity, but I can't deny the impact of seeing an orca or dolphin up close. Even the penguin habitat took my breath away. It's hard to reconcile these feelings. My family seemed to enjoy it just as much as I did. Maybe more. They don't have the same reservations that I do about zoos and such. It was definitely something that my little brother won't ever forget. I think he's just old enough to really realize what's going on, and you could see on his face that the moment he pet the dolphin was magical. I can't wait to see how he feels about that moment when he grows older.",,3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJUTHB15
