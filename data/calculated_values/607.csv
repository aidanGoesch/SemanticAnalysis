I really had it in my mind that he was finally going to propose to me! I spent a few hours getting ready in advance. I took a shower, got my favorite clothes together, and did both my makeup and my hair. There was no way I was going to waste this moment. I spent the rest of the afternoon fantasizing about the big moment: maybe we would end up on that huge screen they advertise; or maybe he had something crazy planned, like a flash mob. I know it sounds silly, but my mind was running wild. A weird mix of nervousness and excitement fluttered in my chest. When it was time to head out to the game, I almost expected John to be in a nice suit and clean-shaven. I walked downstairs to meet up with him and found that he was wearing his typical fan jersey and he was wagging a huge #1 finger around excitedly. My heart sank, and I realized that, maybe, I was wrong. I was shocked! Suddenly felt kind of stupid being all dolled up. John jokingly told me I was way overdressed, and I grumbled something about how I thought he was going to propose to me tonight. He looked surprised, and his face changed. John told me that he will propose eventually, but I need to let things happen more organically. He wants it to be a surprise, and if I was able to guess it so easily, the experience might not be the same. At first, I was pretty upset and I couldn't figure out what he was talking about but I thought about it a little bit and realized he was right. This wasn't the first time I tried to push the situation, and I guess I was being a little overzealous about getting married. I hugged him, and went back upstairs to change into a matching team jersey. We ended up going on a fun date, and it all worked out in the end.",,33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS6UXS5
