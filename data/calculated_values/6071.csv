He really was the most amazing person in my life, he always encouraged me and did whatever he could within his power to make me happy. Having him gone so suddenly was such a shock. It's not like you could ever be prepared for something like this, no matter how much notice you have, but the fact that it just happened is so hard to cope with. He was fine one day and then gone the next. My mom is heartbroken, along with my other siblings, no one knows how to function without him, he was the rock of the family. He always had an answer for everything, there was nothing he couldn't fix. I am so glad that I had the time with him that I did, he taught me so many different useful things that I am forever grateful for. I always joked that I was his boy, he wanted a boy so badly and taught me all the things you would teach your son. Countless days changing breaks, oil changes, spark plugs, cutting the grass, building furniture. I hated it, now I am so grateful for that time and wish I could go back and hear him yell at me for holding the flashlight in the wrong position just one more time. The whole family has really come together for the first time in a long time to celebrate his life and be sure no one forgets what a wonderful person he was. The first few days, listening to all the stories people had of him, sharing photos, seeing how many lives he touched, it meant so much. We plan on holding a family picnic every year for him on his birthday, a day to reminisce and come together to remind us of him. He would have wanted everyone to be happy and think about the good times with him, so that's exactly what we plan on doing. He has grandchildren that will grow up hearing the stories of how great their papa was and will never have to wonder about him because well all be sure to keep his memory alive and let them know how loved they were by him.",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1R8RLB87
