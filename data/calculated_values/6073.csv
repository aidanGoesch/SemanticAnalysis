This story begins like any other -- I started the day by waking up, showering, having a small breakfast and then preparing to leave for work. On most days, I ride to work with my coworker since he lives very close by and doesn't mind driving me. That day was no different. I hopped in my coworker's (we'll refer to him as 'D' from now on) car and said 'good morning'. D greeted me, we put our seat belts on and then headed for work. Everything seemed to be going as it normally did - D and I shared some small-talk on the way to work. We ended up stopping at a coffee-shop drive through to help us wake up a little more.   After leaving the coffee shop, our normal routine was disrupted by something rather shocking and unexpected: While we were at a stoplight, we witnessed a vehicle run a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the road with his car! D and I were both shocked and felt helpless. I immediately dialed 911 to report an emergency, as I was worried for the pedestrian's life. To my surprise, after explaining the incident, the 911 operator put me on hold! I couldn't believe that an emergency this severe was being put on the back burner -- I was a little peeved. However, around 3 minutes later, the operator came back on the phone and assured me that emergency services were on their way. I was relieved, but still worried about the pedestrian who had been stuck by the car.   At this point, D and I decided to get out of the car and make sure the pedestrian was alright. The pedestrian was in disarray, but stable and not in critical danger -- he just had a few scrapes and bruises.    Around 4 minutes later, the ambulance arrived. We stayed with the pedestrian until the ambulance assured us that he was alright and taken care of.    D and I rode to work just like normally afterwards - but we had to explain to our boss why we were late!",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1R8XMB8K
