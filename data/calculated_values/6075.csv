I was nervous to travel so far to celebrate my mother's birthday since I have never been on a plane before. Mother insisted we go to Ghana because she wanted to see the local wildlife and it had been her dream for years. I was nervous to be in a new place where I wasn't very familiar with the culture. Eventually, once I got to know a few locals, I was able relax and enjoy my time there. One young lady that I met was a tour guide on a local safari.  Her name was Julie and she was so lively and lovely. She was enthusiastic about showing us around and was very good at her job. I could feel the chemistry as we joked around together the entire day. At the end of the day, I didn't want to say goodbye. I knew I had  to take a risk and ask her for her number. The next day I texted her after we had gone out to lunch and asked if she was free to meet a small cafe. To my surprise, she agreed and actually seemed excited. We really hit it off and agreed to stay in touch after I returned to America. So, for the last few months we have been texting every day. We try to video chat or talk on the phone as much as possible. I am so thankful for this trip and the opportunity to get to know Julie. I really think she is the love of my life. We are already planning a future together. I am going to ask her to marry me when she comes to the US to visit next month. I already picked out the ring and I have to go pick it up next week.",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1RQXY8BB
