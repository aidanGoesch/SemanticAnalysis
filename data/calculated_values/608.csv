I am divorced and was never really happy with my previous marriage.  We were more like friends.  When I met my current boyfriend, I finally felt what it was like to truly love someone.  I want to be with him forever.  I see myself thinking about when he will propose all the time.  We were going to a game that was significant to both of us and seemed like it would be a cool idea.  I was disappointed when nothing happened.  I should just let things happen.  Instead I wound up sad when I should have been enjoying the game itself.  Since then, I have found myself trying to focus more on enjoying time as it is happening.  I am working on things I want to improve with myself.  I will love him even if we don't get married.  I also don't want him to feel pressured.  It was a good lesson.",33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS6UXS5,
