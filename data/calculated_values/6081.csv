It is a great new bar and it is a very comfortable place that is newly renovated. The decor is just my style with old dark furniture and comfortable chairs. It is so close to my house that it really will be easy to get to. I won't have to spend extra money to get there.  I can walk there in about 10 minutes. I had one very memorable evening last month when I met up with some of my friends. We were talking about Game of Thrones and discussing the final episode and a tall good looking man next to us overheard our conversation. He joined in with some very interesting comments and I found myself very interested in his comments. We discovered that we had other TV shows that we loved also. I asked him to join our group and we talked for three hours. I was surprised to find that I felt like I had known him for a long time. It was one of the best evening I had experienced in a long time. As we said goodby, he asked if I would be coming back soon and I agreed that I would be back soon. He said he looked forward to talking again.",,3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQ4OE74P
