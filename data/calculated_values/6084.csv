I am divorcing my husband.  We will go our separate ways.  Time will heal all wounds.  At this moment in my life I am ready to start over.  It was a very difficult marriage.  We were never on the same page.  I focused mainly on the duties of the house and homeschooling my children.  He lived a life that was separate from ours.  He worked late most evening.  By the time he got home the children would be retiring for the night and I was to exhausted to care.  The sign was there that we were quickly growing apart.  I wanted to go to counseling but he didn't.  I wanted to have date nights but he did not want to make time for it.  It takes two to want a marriage.  He wore me out so, I evidently did not want it either.  I filed for divorce because the marriage was irreconcilable broken.  It was no way that it could be fixed.  Needless to say, he was shocked at least he said he was. He claimed that he did not know that it had gotten to that point.  He said that he was blindsided.  I find that so hard to believe.  Maybe, he was in denial.  I must admit that I was in denial for a long time about the relationship getting better.  It was time for me to test my wings.",3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQ6FV74Q,
