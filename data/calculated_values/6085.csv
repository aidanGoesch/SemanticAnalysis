My divorce will be final soon.  My lawyer called me today.  He said that my husband lawyer wants to settle out of court.  I am happy about this.  This has been going on for two years now.  He wants the house and I want to sell it.  I am tired of going back and forth with him.  So, I tell my lawyer that he can keep the house and the furniture.  In return I want to be paid a certain about for three years so, I can start afresh.  This would be my time to go back to college.  I plan on getting a certificate or something so that I would be able to take care of myself.  This is my time.  I have raised my children now, I can put myself first.  I don't need another man in my life because I have these issues that I need to deal with.  I need a career.  I don't want to attract the type of man that I had for 25 years of marriage.  I will spend this time getting to know me and building my self-esteem. This year is for me.  I will focus on my needs for once in my life.",3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQ6FV74Q,3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQ6FV74Q
