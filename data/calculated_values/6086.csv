It was a smaller spectacle but worth the effort. We had lots of people have fun. It was almost like a family reunion of sorts. Many people stayed to talk late into the night. Lots of food and laughter were had. I never knew the whole family had done something like this in so long. It was crazy the people I forgot about and how much they had changed. I felt like I was in a movie. Overall everyone had fun. The ceremony was beautiful and lots of tears. Being part of the setup made me feel welcomed and useful. I like the decor. Seeing old family members was quite fun. We need to do more reunions.,,3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQBRU74I
