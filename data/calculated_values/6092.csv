I was sitting in the parking lot working on some reports and enjoying the unusual lack of activity. As I sat in the car with my windows rolled down, snacking on some beef jerky, I heard a soft thump from the roof of the car. I looked around, shining my flashlight through the empty parking lot and seeing nothing. As I turned back to my computer I noticed a small grey cat perched on the hood of my car. We stared at each other for a moment, silently. The cat slowly approached the windshield glass, never breaking eye contact. The silence was interrupted by the sound of my radio screeching. As I turned away to adjust the volume, the cat jumped from its perch on the hood to suddenly hop through the open window and into my lap. Startled, I offered her a piece of the beef jerky still in my hand, which she happily accepted. We continued silently munching jerky for several minutes. Just then my partner pulled up. He asked, what are you doing with a cat? I said that I wasn't certain, that the cat had just appeared and invited herself into my car. My partner laughed and said could he pet the cat too. I said sure. But the cat would not go to him. She seemed content to hang out in my car the entire evening. As my shift continued, I took the cat with me to each call, leaving the windows down so she could leave if she wanted to. She never left. By morning, I accepted that the cat had simply adopted me and that was that. I took the cat home, searched extensively for its owner, but couldn't find any trace of one. The cat is still with me, having moved in and made herself right at home. She settled right into life at my house. We couldn't be happier. So that's the story of how my cat adopted me/.",,3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQCW9475
