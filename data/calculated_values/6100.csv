I have just been so busy with my boyfriend, Jake.  The turning point in our relationship came on a weekend about three months ago, and I'm sure you want to hear all about it. As I said, that was about three months ago. Jake had seemed kind of fishy, smiling a lot during the previous two weeks.  When Friday came, he showed up at my apartment and told me that I needed to pack enough comfortable clothes for three days!  Considering he typically doesn't even stay the night, this made me very nervous!  He refused to tell me where we were going, but told me I needed jeans and shoes for walking outside. So I nervously packed up and we got into his car.  He wanted to put a blindfold on me, but I refused, because it would make me car sick. I agreed not to pay attention to where we were going.   Turns out, he had rented us a cabin right on the lake, about 90 minutes out of town.  It was so beautiful!  It was quiet and peaceful.  The first thing he wanted to do was go swimming in the lake.  I didn't bring a swimsuit!  Well, he didn't either, and turns out he had wanted us to go skinny dipping.  It was awesome, but I was so embarrassed because I had never let Jake see me naked in full daylight where he could see all of me.  It was also very....  inspiring, so you can only guess what happened after the swimming.. I'll never tell!!Anyway, it started getting late and Jake wanted me to cook dinner.  Well, guess what?  There is no stove or microwave in this place.  Just a big fire pit in the back.  I have never cooked on a fire before!    He said he learned how in boy scouts and that he would show me, and he did!  It was the best weekend, so peaceful and beautiful and I feel so much closer to Jake now.",,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TA9T0N37
