We met up with a couple of his other friends and had the best time. I love going up there as it is. But for this particular weekend, Ben and I were newly in a relationship and he planned the weekend to entertain me. The weekend got off on an awkward note because I was in charge of marinating the steaks for dinner and didn't seal the bags correctly. We had an entire cooler full of Busch that tasted like raw meat. Yucky, but memorable. He took his quad up, as did his friend. So I got my first proper quad ride! Our first night was pretty low key. Dinner, a fire, and some beer. The next day, his friend Dave wanted to go fishing. So we all rode the quads around, chasing Dave to the next best fishing spot he could find. It's very rural up there, surrounded by game lands, so it's acceptable to zoom down the roads on just quads. We were going faster than we would in an actual vehicle. Dave never caught his fish, but we did cross a stream on the quads which was exciting. Dave is a former marine, so later that afternoon he gave me my first ever shooting lesson. He's a great teacher! Very thorough and critical, but also positive. ""Okay, that was good. But you can do better! Here's what you're doing wrong. Look at this video I took of you!"" Then we ate dinner and took a sunset quad ride. We watched the day end in an open field at the top of a hilltop. It was magical.",,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TA9T0N37
