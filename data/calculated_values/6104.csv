There were times when I didn't sleep for days and days. The dreams felt like they blended in with the days. My college experience was a confusing time, filled with sadness, heartbreak, loss. I know for a fact however that my experience was felt by many others too. I found solace in that at times. But at the time I felt like the world was going to come crashing down. It was such a memorable experience but I am happy it is over. There was one time when I felt I couldn't finish it. I felt like running away from all of my responsibilities but I didn't. I pushed through, I passed in all of assignments on time. I aced all of my finals. I asked for recommendation letters from all of my professors. It was a great experience, and worth every penny. I wouldn't change anything if I had the chance to do so.",,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPMZN38
