It was about 3 months ago and it was a great and relieving experience. I worked so hard during college trying to get ahead in life. There were times when I thought I should just give up and get a non-degree related job. I had to ignore those negative thoughts and do what I needed to do. I can hands down say the most powerful moment of the experience was when the diploma was placed into my hands. It was very empowering and reassured me that all my hard work was worth it. My family was taking pictures of me during the event, and upon seeing them I can see the pure expression of joy on my face. I proved all my naysayers wrong and it was such a great feeling to know that. I finally feel like I became the person I was always trying to be. The ceremony was amazing, with a big crowd i stadium seats. It was sunny with a slight breeze, just right. I felt like I was in a dream as this was happening, and had to pinch myself to really know that it was real. I thought that the road to get there would not ended up being worth it, but it really was. I would not change a thing about any of the decisions I made.",3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPMZN38,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPMZN38
