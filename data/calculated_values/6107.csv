We met in high school. We were made in love back then. But things changed, as I said. He became a different person once we settled into married life. He seemed to be dissatisfied with out life. His love and our love evaporated. I always expected something was up once refused to stay at home so nights. I just could not bring myself to confront him. Eventually I had enough and told him I thought he was cheating. He was unhappy with our marriage so he admitted to it. This launched an ugly divorce process. I  hated every bit of it and felt like a lesser person during it.  That said, I am just relieved that it is finally, finally over. Hopefully things will start to get better.",,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPRH3NG
