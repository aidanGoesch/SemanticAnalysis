It was the first time i had seen him in almost two years. He abandoned our children and now, unexpectedly, wants to start seeing them again despite not having followed the court-ordered supervised visitation plan. Leading up to our court date, I was definitely feeling nervous. As the day loomed ever close, I had feelings of restlessness and an inability to function. He was severely emotionally abusive in our marriage. He also emotionally abused our children. I really wanted nothing to do with going, but I couldn't get out of it. When I showed up at the court house, I had hoped it was going to be like our divorce proceedings where he just didn't show up. I was taken to a conference room to meet with my lawyer. On the way there, I saw him at the front desk checking in. My nerves hit an all-time high. My lawyer and I discussed our strategy to file a motion and reply to the motions my ex had filed. When we finally went into the court room before the magistrate, it was exactly as I expected. My ex didn't fail to show his true colors, and it was painfully obvious that the magistrate was far from impressed with his demeanor.  After the short pre-trail was over, I was surprised by how I felt, coming away from the experience with very little emotion. It felt more like relief.",3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPRH3NG,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPRH3NG
