There were three other people in the class with me. One was a typical ""truck driver"" type. One was a very annoying middle aged woman that insisted everyone learn the ""pre-trip inspection"" the way she was. And finally there was a loud abrasive lady that struggled with memorizing the pre-trip inspection. Of the three instructors that rotated through the students, there was one that honestly didn't even know the pre-trip that well. One older guy that had obviously been teaching it the same exact way for years and a third, more reasonable, instructor that knew it well and was only concerned that you learned it and did not care about what verbiage you used. We all tried to help the loud lady learn the steps of the inspection. I told her to use little memory tricks to remember different things, but the older teacher told me that the only way to be sure to pass was to learn his method and verbiage. The annoying student also insisted this was how the loud lady should learn. Both the annoying student and older teacher quizzed me daily and always pointed out any time I deviated from their method, even if it was technically correct. After the first of two weeks, I had the entire pre-trip inspection memorized in my own way. And honestly, I could even do it with the exact verbiage the older teacher insisted on. However, the loud lady had only memorized maybe a third of it. I worked with her before class and kept telling her to use the memory tricks that worked for her. She started to get it. By my last day of class, she had most of it down. The next day was my CDL test at the Motor Vehicle Division (MVD in Arizona, but DMV everywhere else). I performed the pre-trip for the inspector in my own method with my own verbiage. I used proper wording for different parts and procedures, but not at all in the way the older teacher had insisted. When I had finished, the inspector said, ""I don't usually tell people their score. I just tell them if they passed or not. But you got 100%. You were perfect and I have only ever had 3 people do it perfect. Whatever you did, you did it right"".I found out later that the loud girl did pass her inspection.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMU4S30FV
