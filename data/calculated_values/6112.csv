I usually stay fit and have a good routine for my workout. But, 3 months ago, a director who was well rated in film industry approached me for a role in which I have to gain weight. I have to look extra and had to gain around double my weight for acting in that film and then have to again loose the weight. He asked for which part do I need to shoot first. The fit one or the fat one. I said fat one, because if I do fit role first and then fat one, I may not work hard enough to get my fit self back. So, first I did a fat role and gain weight. After that, I had to again be a slim and fit. This was the most difficult task. It is easy to gain weight, but very hard to again get fit. The most hardest job. At one time, I was about to quit, but I kept going and I was back to normal. It was the proud moment for me. I get to learn new challenging aspects of my life.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMULJQ0FH
