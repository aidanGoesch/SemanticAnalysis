We could pay for child care, but he price was great. So we thought about me being a stay at home dad. It would help on cost. But I would also forgo working a paying job. Overall it was a tough choice. But being a stay at home dad was a great thing to me. I love being with my kids. I love to take care of them. So on many fronts it is a great thing. I do sometimes wonder what it would be like if we did the child care route. But I can't imagine not being with them each day. They are a big part of my life now. I like to be a parent to them. So overall I think we made the right choice.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSDK0F6
