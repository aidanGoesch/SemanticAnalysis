I grew up in a small town in Kentucky and I don't really know many people outside of the State. At least not that I had realized. My Papaw a week ago was the first person to say that we should go see my Great Aunt Helen before she passed away. Mind you I'm twenty five now and have never even heard of the woman. Guilt must have been a motivating factor, he had vowed to pay my way and who was I to pass up the opportunity? The most stressful thing was getting through the airport and the wait to even get on the plane. I don't ever remembering having to take my shoes off to get through an x-ray machine, but I did and I didn't die from it I guess, haha. It took a bit to even get going after sitting down in my seat with my Papaw. He seemed nervous, but I was not. I wanted to mark this off of my bucket list. The take off really freaked me out, but being in that seat, man there is NOTHING like it. I felt lifted out of my body. There was a familiar knot I felt in my stomach like when I was high on a Roller Coaster, but it was only similar in that sense. Nothing and I mean NOTHING, compared to this feeling. I looked down through the window at what looked like boxes of corn fields and such and just realized that somewhere down there in those little tiny rows were my family. I was that small. I still can't get over that feeling that somewhere there are tons of people probably having that same revelation. It's an insane experience and I'm glad I got to do it.
