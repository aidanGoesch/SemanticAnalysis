If you remember, she's the one I met in Miami 5 months ago. She was such an amazig girl. She was very pretty, and very smart, too. We had so much in common, and the things that we didn't have in common only made me more curious about her. I can't wait to see her again. We have kept in touch. She lives about 75 miles away from me, but that doesn't matter. When you have something good, you make it work, right? Anyway, she is supposed to come see me in two weeks. I am trying to plan what we should do for the time she's here. She'll be here for a 4 day weekend, so I want to makre sure we have a lot of fun. I am going to take her to dinner, but I want to cook for her too. I was thinking about taking her to a concert, or maybe to a wine tasting festival? I'm not sure, but I know whatever we decide, it's going to be a blast.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUVWWF02
