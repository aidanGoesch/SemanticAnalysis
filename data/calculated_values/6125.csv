I personally think there should be a traffic light at the T-junction so to prevent anything problem in the future. By the way was there a traffic light at the T-junction? if there was a traffic light at the T-junction then why did the driver try to overtake another driver. My main point in this whole story stated above is the fact that, did they involve the police? did the police arrest the driver who tried to overtake another at the T-junction. It's a tragic seen and mentally passengers will need to visit the hospital.",3WSELTNVR4OCZUQETHKSA8D8T2LTA4,
