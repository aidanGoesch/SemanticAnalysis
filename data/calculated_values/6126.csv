The incident happened in the afternoon. On a very sunny day. I was a witness when this incident happened. There is a T-junction on a highway. where the incident happened. The clouds changed after some time. it was shocking to me. Because the sun was shining as the weather was not going to change. But all of a sudden it changed. And it felt at if it was going to rain. I was at the left side just in front of a tall building. There was four cars approaching at the junction of the T-road instead of three. Because the junction can only allow three cars intersect at a time. The fourth car was trying to overtake another car. There was a serious chaos among all the cars.,3WSELTNVR4OCZUQETHKSA8D8T2LTA4,3WSELTNVR4OCZUQETHKSA8D8T2LTA4
