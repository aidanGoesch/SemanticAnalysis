I was so thankful when my family invited me to go to Disneyland. I had never been there before. I had always wanted to go but never had the money. I packed my suitcase and headed off to go on the trip. I was so excited. When I got there I couldn't believe it. It was like being taken to a different world. Everything was so amazing there. The castle looked so beautiful. The rides were so amazing. The food was quite expensive but it was still very good. I had a great time. I now see why they refer to this as the happiest place on earth. I can't remember the last time I was so happy in my life.,,3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAN07CB4
