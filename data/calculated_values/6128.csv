It was my sisters birthday. I got invited to go to Disneyland with her and some other family members. I was excited but i also didn't know what to expect. The trip getting there was not too bad. Only about an hour from where i lived. It was a maze just getting from the parking lot to the ticket booth. There was tram for every part of the park which was nice. The prices were crazy but i was just glad i was not the one paying for it. I went in with low expectations but all of that changed shortly afterwards. I got in on several rides to start and was blown away. It was like being in an entire different world. The only thing i did not like were the large crowds. I had lunch afterwards. The food was great but the prices were not. Got on some more rides afterwards until i could not no more. I took some picture while i was there so i could later recall the memorable day i had. I can see why they call it the happiest place eon earth.,,3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAN07CB4
