I am a 50 year old female. I have several different symptoms. I get dizzy. I get sick with colds all the time. I get paranoid. I have had atleast 70 different symptoms. About 8 weeks ago. I started suffering from a debilitating insomnia. From this I developed a heart flutter. My friend became concerened. She was in fear I would pass out. She was very much afraid I'd even pass away from this. I put her mind at ease as I have gone to the Doctor and got help for it. It was then about 8 weeks ago I realized I had a really good friend on my hands. I love my newly realized best friend!,,3WYGZ5XF3X1HW7MLG8SRUHKIWXFSKB
