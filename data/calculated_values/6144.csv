I can't sleep at night because I see my mothers face and her lips turning blue. I can sometimes feel her clutching my shoulders like she did when I was trying to get her out of the car. I can hear the beeping of the machines. I was in McDonalds and the fryer made me go right back to her coding in the emergency room. I just keep reliving the event over and over again. I don't leave the house often. I lost my dog to a weird emergency just a few weeks after losing mom. I really miss my dog, and I cry about him daily. Sometimes I wonder if I am actually crying about my dog or if I am crying for my mom. I guess it is all subjective. I am just in pain. I hate getting out of bed. I hate going through her room to get to my laundry room. I just want to heal. I sometimes go sit in the car because that is the last place besides the hospital that we were together. it is hard to explain to people, so I don't talk about it. I remember the Dr. just looking so sorry, but why didn't the nurse start CPR, why did no one take her out of the wheelchair? I am angry and I am sad and I am just wanting someone to tell me why they did not respond to the emergency as the emergency that it was.",3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K3132U6YM,
