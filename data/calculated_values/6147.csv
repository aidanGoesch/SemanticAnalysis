Even on our first date, I could tell he was special and that we got a long in a way that I really didn't with anyone else. I could see myself actually marrying this guy and I'd only known him for a few minutes. I thought to myself on our first date: ""This is what love at first sight feels like."" We had one more magical date and then he moved back home to Los Angeles. I still think about him all the time and it's been two whole months. He thinks about me as well and feels the exact same way. I just bought a house in North Carolina. I can't leave and I won't for a new relationship. I know that it won't last long distance and it hurts. I feel like you only meet people like this once in a lifetime. I'm worried that this is my first and last time meeting a soulmate. I'm hopeful that one day we'll meet again. But for now, I'm not completely sure it will work out. He's told me that he could fall in love with me. And honestly, I could fall in love with him also. That's what I want as well.",,3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K31BSUY62
