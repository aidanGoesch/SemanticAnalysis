I just didn't know ME anymore, you know? I had given up on everything for my ex. I was a shell of my former self. I didn't have hobbies, interests, anything. I just wasn't me anymore. And I was miserable. But I had to get out of that mindset. I had to assure myself that my dreams were still important, that I was still capable of doing anything I wanted in life. I knew I could, and I wouldn't let myself give up. No one could convince me otherwise. Anything and everything is possible. I mightve had a a bad day, month, year, hell, decade. I can still do what I need to. I still believe in myself.",,3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K31CLDY68
