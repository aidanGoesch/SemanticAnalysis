As a now single mother, I was devastated. I almost gave up on everything, but the need for providing and helping my 3 children kept me going. I am from a country marred with corruption and nepotism. I knew that my income would not be enough to raise three kids, and I also understood that it would be difficult getting a new job. I talked to a few people and they told me that I should try going to United States of America under asylum.  I researched on the process, and I started my journey. I researched lawyers and picked a good one who is an expert in the field.  We made all necessary contact, and she invited me to come to the United States.  Shortly after arriving, I applied for asylum. The lawyer told me that I should apply ''affirmatively''. During application, I included my children who are my driving force and the main reason I was doing it. I included all necessary additional documents. I also had to add the little evidence I had that my country was not good for raising three kids as a single mother.  After this, I mailed my document to the relevant organization. Earlier this week, I was invited for an interview by the USCIS. I had to bring some identification and witnesses. At the end of it all, I was granted asylum.",,3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K31CQVY60
