They had come from another country to the USA seeking asylum due to the father of her children being murdered. The children needed physicals for school and the mother had a tooth that was hurting her with infection due to her tooth having broken .I was able to get the children in to clinic to get their shots and have their physicals done for school. Doing this helped her not lose her food stamps. She had just lost her job and could not feed her children without her food stamps. I was also able to get the mother an appointment with our dentist. When she saw the dentist we found she had lots of infection. She had not been able to eat or sleep due to the pain. By the time she left she had an xray done and had antibiotics to help with her infection. The children are so sweet and appreciative and the mother was the same way. It made me grateful that I was able to speak their language to be able to help them and make sure they got what they needed in order to survive without their patriarch. It was a sad situation but their personalities made it such a pleasant experience to be a part of. This mother put her children first which all parents should do. I am thankful she was able to escape the dangerous situation she was in in her home country. She came to the USA to take care of her family and she was doing the best she could. I hope that I may be of help to her if she ever needs help again.,,3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K31CQVY60
