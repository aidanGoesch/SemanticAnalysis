Her older sister and cousin were both running around the splash pad having a great time while the adults sat under an umbrella.  Her uncle was snoozing on the ground and she pushed herself off his chest to a standing position from the ground and looked at me.  She took three deliberate steps toward me and I lost my mind.  My father saw it as well and he was overly excited as well.  We were both laughing happily and making a fuss over her.  We woke up her uncle who was snoozing on the ground and exclaimed how amazing it was to just have witnessed such an amazing thing.  My mom and sister both missed seeing the milestone in her life but were both delighted to have been there when she accomplished something so amazing. At that moment, I was such a proud mommy.  Being a mother and witnessing these beautiful little babies accomplish any milestone is one of the best feelings a person can experience.  I'm so proud of both of my little girls.  In that moment, I also felt my mortality.  Watching your little ones age and grow you become aware of your own aging.  You know that you will never get these moments back.  They will only ever live on in memory.  But every moment is worth it.",3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K31D8ZY65,
