I wanted to be able to go back to a normal life, and I also wanted to see my beautiful baby. I was completely done with being pregnant. Then, one somber afternoon, it happened. I knew that I was going into labor. I yelled for my husband, and we go into the car and drove to the hospital. I was in so much pain on the way. I remember yelling at my husband almost the whole way there, but he took it like a champ. I was so ready to have this baby. When we arrived to the hospital, I was starting to get more worried. This was my first child, how would this feel? What if something goes wrong? My mind raced, but I was mostly in too much pain to care. Apparently I couldn't get an epidural because I was ready to have the baby right away. My baby was finally born, and I couldn't be happier.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXE3DLTBS
