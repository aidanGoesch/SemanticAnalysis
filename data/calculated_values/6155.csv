I recently gave birth on May 26th. I remember how it first started when I was going into labor. My water never broke, but I felt the contractions. It felt like it was the worse cramp I have ever felt. It started around 12-1AM when it started. I was just suffering through these contractions at home, while my husband slept to get some rest. I waiting until my contractions were closer in intervals. When it start getting to about 4 minutes between each contraction, I told my husband that we needed to go to the hospital. So, we got a taxi and was at the hospital. I wanted to get the epidural to relieve my pain, but the nurse told me that my cervix was already 8 cm dilated, so since it was so close for me to push, she couldn't let me have the pain reliever. Now, I remember being in the room, I changed and laid down. Once, the doctor got there, it was time for me to push. In all of this pain, I tried my best to breathe through it. Active labor wasn't long, but it was so painful. The doctor even had to cut me, to get my baby out. But those moments in the hospital with my little new born was the most memorable moments of my life. I vowed to be the best mother I could be from there on. I've found more to push for and more to live for. It is one of the most impactful things that has changed my life.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXE3DLTBS
