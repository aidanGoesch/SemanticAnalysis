This wasn't your average princess party.  My friend put quite the twist on the average played out Disney princesses.  Instead she focuses on strong woman role models, who also just happened to be women. Her guests were adorned with a gift bag that was specific to one princess.  My daughter received a Princess Diana themed bag.  It had a picture with information on the back, and a fact book about her.  It also had a crown that replicated Princess Diana's.  The girls all dressed up like there princess, and said out loud one fact they learned.  The followed up with a costume contest. The person who seemed to have captured the essence of their princess the best one a prize.  Each prize was specific to a princess as well.  The cake was magical.  It was a portrate of the birthday girls favorite princess! Everyone had a great time, and learned something important that day.  I was very impressed with my friends idea.  It made me really think about what I wanted to do for my daughters birthday.",3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXEAQMTBQ,
