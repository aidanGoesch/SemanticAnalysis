One I'll be telling my grandchildren about one day, I hope. Approximately three months ago, my company was having an outing for its employees as a way to reward them for their hard work. They provided tickets for us to go to a baseball game. We could bring one person with us. Naturally, I decided to bring my boyfriend. I had never been to a baseball game before and this sounded like a fun thing to do, so I was really looking forward to it. My boyfriend and I sat close to the stadium, I had a hot dog in one hand a drink in another and I was chewing on the hot dog when suddenly, I noticed my face on a big screen above the stadium. Someone called my name. My boyfriend held my hand and led me to the courtyard, got down on one knee and as I held my breath and tried not to cry, he proposed to me while holding out the most precious, blue sapphire ring I'd ever seen. The entire experience felt surreal and he took my breath away at that moment. I had always seen these things happening to other people on TV, but never in a million years did I expect something this grand to happen to me, as much as I wanted it to. He mumbled a few romantic words and I could tell he was nervous. I was smiling. I was trying hard not to cry. I didn't want to ruin the moment for him. I heard him say he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. He called me his best friend. His true souls mate. It couldn't get any more romantic than that. then he popped the question. Naturally, I said yes! My co-workers cheered. I started crying as he slipped the ring on my finger. We kissed and I couldn't wait to tell my parents that I was engaged.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXEM5CBT4
