I got engaged! I knew that the day was coming I just wasn’t sure when. I was hoping he would do it on my birthday, but the day came and went and nothing. I was nervous that he was going to do it on our big family vacation in August but he did it last night right after the baseball game! We had been out all afternoon with all his coworkers for the company night out at the baseball game. We met at the house earlier that afternoon and got dressed and ready. We went to the local bar and grill across the street from the stadium to meet up with some people and grab some food and free parking. While we walked over, I walked with a couple of the girls from his job who always ask me when the two of us are going to get married. I always look at him and say I don’t know its up to him and he always responds with “Never” and gives me a cheeky grin.  When we got to our seats we separated and found some other friends. All night he kept avoiding be alone with me but our friends kept on asking when he was going to propose. Finally after our team had won we were about to leave the park. We were walking out and were the last ones out of the stadium pretty much he got down one knee and proposed right there in the center of the grass courtyard going into the stadium. It was amazing and of course I had said yes.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXEM5CBT4
