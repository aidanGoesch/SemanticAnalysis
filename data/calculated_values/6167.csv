We had been friends for years through some interesting and formative moments of our lives. We originally met through work quite soon after graduating. I think that we became close because we had a lot in common and had gone through many of the same things: moving to a new country, traveling a lot for work, being somewhat under-appreciated. Several times, we even lived together as housemates which was fun and allowed us to be pretty close friends. About 18 months ago, having recently lived with my friend while job hunting, he somewhat suddenly stopped talking to me without much of an explanation. This was very difficult for me, especially because I didn't know why or what had happened to precipitate this falling out. It felt strange and undeserved and I couldn't really find a reason for it or a way to undo it. However, in the last several months, he has started writing and even talking to me again. This was a considerable weight off emotionally. I had ruminated a lot about what I had done to deserve that silent treatment. While I'm still not sure why he had cut contact (and maybe I never will be), I'm just glad to have this friend back in my life. We live quite far away from each other, but he's a really good anchor to talk to and to bounce ideas off of. It's good to chat with him and just basically destress. For me, that's great to have someone like that in my life who is a good friend and who has been through so much with me. I'm really glad to have him back in my life. While he's still not as communicative as I am - and our friendship is still not where it was, I'm just glad to have him back and hopefully things will return to where they were again someday.",3X08E93BHW45AU3Z7RVNJTJ8DBL66H,
