I had to gather past work and create a portfolio if you will to show past accomplishments and projects I was currently working on so I could present them at the interview.  There were a few of us interviewing for the new role and we were all excited to be a part of it.  During my interview, I presented  the portfolio I had gathered and discussed it with the interviewer. We also discussed my qualifications for the job and the new role. We discussed what the responsibilities of the new role would be. We had sat and talked for quite a while. It was a productive interview overall. I learned a lot about the role, what I could bring to it and how I could help the team succeed. It took a while but i was offered the new role. The person interviewing me had considerable power over me and i'm sure it took some thought as to who they would hire for the job. I was honored to accept the new role. I was proud of myself for taking on the role and new I could bring a lot to it. I knew of the challenges i would face but was excited to take it on.  I felt that I was ready for it overall.  I worked hard for it and would make sure there wasn't any regret for hiring me for it. I made sure to prepare myself for my first day as best as possible. I introduced myself to my new team and got right down to work.",3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDBESWSR,
