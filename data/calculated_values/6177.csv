I have always loved live music and dreamed of going to a John Mayer concert, and I was able to finally. After years of listening to his music, the perfect moment had come. I didn't have work, I had enough money saved, the universe had opened this opportunity up for me. When I found out he was going on tour, I immediately went to look at ticket prices. I knew that his shows would sell out quickly, and the prices would skyrocket. With some luck, and haste, I was able to secure tickets for the show. During the night of the event, the venue was very crowded. My friend and I found our seats which were very nice, and somewhat close to the stage. There was no opening act because John Mayer had wanted it this way so he had more time to perform this tour. My friend and I were talking to each other beforehand in anticipation. And then suddenly we were interrupted by the sound of guitar. The show had begun. John Mayer came out on the stage opening the show up with one of his most iconic songs, gravity. I surprised myself with tears in my eyes. I didn't realize how emotional his music made me feel until that moment. His opening number was definitely the most memorable moment of the show for me. I think it is because the anticipation I had, finally came to fruition. Ever since I was a child, I had listened to John Mayer. I recall my mother driving me to school playing him on the speakers while I sat in the back seat. This was definitely the best concert I had ever been to. I will never forget it.",3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDDMKWS1,3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDDMKWS1
