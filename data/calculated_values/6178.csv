Our team shows up on scene with a fully stocked heavy road service truck to get you back on your way as quickly as safety allows.   Our tire suddenly blew, so we pulled off at an exit where a garage was supposed to be. It was closed, so pulled out her (super-old) spare, and while everyone else figured out how to change it , I held very angry cat in the hopes that he wouldn't run away whenever someone opened a door. I did nothing to help change the tire, and I got an adorable picture out of it.  I had the drill thing (still don’t even know what it's called) and lots of patience. I got the tire off and went to go get the spare, which I did not know how to get on, and the tire that I had left upright rolled down into the woods. So I wasn’t going to leave without my tire because of the new rim, plus I couldn’t figure out how to put the new one on the way.  I will surely and go for many pieces and repair techniques will be proceed and always they solve in my way. This was one of memorable incident.",,3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDULWWSS
