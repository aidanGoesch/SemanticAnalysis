HP love craft has always been an inspiration of mine but I never dreamed I’d be a writer. And now I wonder if I made the right decision sticking with the first publisher to come along. But I can’t worry about that right now because I’m a writer! Ah it’s so exciting and My parents and wife are so proud of me. We went out to eat at a fancy restaurant the night I found out I was going to get a publication. I don’t think I’ll be on the best seller list or anything but fingers crossed. “We’ve never seen anything like this before we love it”. It was incredible hearing that from someone with an unbiased opinion. I always am the type of person to doubt those closes to me. But now I have to make sure to keep it up. I’ve already started brainstorming and writing down ideas for a new article maybe even a book! All this positive motivation has me feeling like I could do anything. There’s a lot of nervous anxiety sprinkled in but that’s normal. I hope to have a rough draft written up by next month and see what they think. Well, time to break out the story board! Wish me luck!",,3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDUMHWSF
