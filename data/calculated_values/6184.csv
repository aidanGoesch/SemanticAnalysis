I know it is a well-known cleashe to be calling your wedding that. But i do understand why everyone says that now. Brad and i got married today. It has been four years in making and we couldn't have imagined a more perfect wedding. Everyone was there- even uncle larry showed up! It was particularly surprising considering he was combating cancer for a while now. But all those didn't matter today. It was about us, and our new beginning. We had a traditional catholic wedding. Mom insisted on that. Jen was my maid of honor. The catering was fantastic. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves. It was a happy time with family.",,3X1FV8S5JYDSMD76KCCH7CCWOIEVGY
