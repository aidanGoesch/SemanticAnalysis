At the start of the session, I admit I was skeptical. The only reason I was doing it is because it was gifted to me; it wasn't something I would have sought out myself. While I've always been a person who believe in spirits and energy living beyond death, someone actually communicating in real time with someone I'd lost was not something I fully believed in. I have to admit that going into the session, my expectations were fairly low. However, it didn't take more than 10 minutes for my entire outlook to change. After telling the medium who it was I wanted to speak to, they kicked off the process to communicate with them. Without going into too much detail, I can say that within the first few minutes of the conversation, I was sure I was speaking to my friend. One thing that the medium said caused me to burst into tearsâ€”my friend knew of the symbol we had created for her after her death. I was also finally given some sort of confirmation that my friend was happier where she was. She said that I didn't need to worry about her, and I was told that she spends time with me sometimes. It's been 3 years since she died, but nothing gave me more relief than this session did. It doesn't make the pain of the death go away, but it absolutely helped with the healing process. I regret now that I waited for so long to take the session out of fear of what I'd hear, because after the fact, I feel that it was the best decision I could have made. I'm so grateful that I even had the opportunity to something like that. I got a sense of closure that many aren't lucky enough to have, and it made a profound difference on my general outlook.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QMMNU,
