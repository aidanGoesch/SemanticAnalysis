We went on a cruise to celebrate the occasion. The planning part of the trip was fun. We got to select from many cruise lines. We decided on carnival because of the price. We finally got on the cruise. We had to do an emergency drill, in case the ship got wrecked. The food was great on the boat. I had a ton of lobster tails and a lot of chocolate. The bar was nice. I got wasted everyday. I had fun dancing on the dance days. We got sweaty because of the intensity. The cruise had a big slide. I went on it a few times. It was very big and always fun.",,3X31TUMD7Y8SMT59OPP8DGAOURP1L8
