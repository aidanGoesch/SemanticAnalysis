My grandmother used to tutor my grandfather in school. When he first saw her,  he thought she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. ""She had long dark hair and was carrying her books in her arms as she walked down main street."" Not long after their tutoring sessions ended, they began a courtship and quickly fell in love.  It was the 1930's and they were young and poor. My grandfather couldn't afford to purchase a wedding ring for my grandmother. She didn't much care about a ring but my grandfather desired to give her one. Many years later,  my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a Fitzgerald, Georgia. On their fifteenth wedding anniversary my grandfather drove my grandmother to his store and had her pick out a wedding set. She chose a modest round cut diamond solitaire and a matching diamond fishtail band. She was very fond of the rings and would only wear them on special occasions that required formal attire. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now but I often think of how determined my grandfather was in getting the rings. He only had an 8th grade education but in his lifetime he owned a Standard Oil filling station, a jewelry store, and was a brakeman for the railroad. Last year on my birthday my mother came over to bring me a card and a gift.  She handed me a little velvet box that had my Grandfather's jewelry store name embossed on it.   I shed some tears as I opened the box to see my grandmother's rings.  They were more beautiful than I remembered.  I was so deeply touched that my mother wanted me to have them. I now wear the band with my wedding set. The rings represent my grandfather's hard work, commitment, and love.  Wearing my grandmother's band makes me feel like a part of my grandparents are still with me.",3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXW87H8L5,
