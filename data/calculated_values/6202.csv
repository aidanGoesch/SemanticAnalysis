I went in to the hospital at ten p.m. the night before to start the induction process. I wasn't worried at all, because, well it was my fourth child, I had given birth three times before and the process had always been easy, quick and pain free, thanks to an epidural. This time around, my plans were the same. I should have known this time would have been different, should have recognized the signs when things started off downhill, after all, it took them seven different sticks and an emergency response team to get my IV in. Around 5 a.m. on the 18th, I wasn't having any bad pain, just a few contractions here and there, nothing consistent. I had not been checked for dialation since midnight, but the pain was increasing, just a little, so I decided to go ahead and get the epidural so I could get some rest, afterall, they hadn't broke my water yet. The anesthesiologist came in a few moments later and began the process. Let's just say that this didn't go as planned either. So here I am, sitting on the edge of the bed, hunched over so he can tap my spine correctly. Well, he misses- FIVE times. Five! No joke, he used six different kits. About 45 minutes into the process, something isn't right. All of a sudden my contractions had sped up, coming in around 30 seconds apart when they had been several minutes apart before. My pain increased exponentially, I was in excruciating pain, still being forced to hunch over and hug my knees because he couldn't get the ""right spot"", meanwhile, the efforts he was making were hitting nerves left and right, send fire and twitches down my right side. During this time, I am screaming, telling the nurse I need to push. She assures me that my water has not broke yet and it's not time to push, the epidural is nearly done. I knew something wasn't right, I pushed the anesthesiologist out of the way just as he started taping the needle down, saying we were good to go. Sure enough, as soon as  I laid down the nurse informed me that the baby was crowning, while another nurse called in an emergency response team (there were no ob's available). Ten minutes later, I had a perfect little baby girl in my arms, but OH MY GOSH, the pain! Unbelievable. By the way, my epidural finally kicked in about five minutes after she was born, so there's that.",,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBQZ8LS
