It was a very nice hotel, and it actually offered a big American style breakfast buffet. Now, I wanted some pancakes, so I go over to the pancake tray. It was one of those metal things that you can open and close. So I go over there and this little Asian kid, no older than maybe 3 or 4 is struggling to open the pancake tray. He's pretty short, being 3 years old and all. So me, being the kind person I am, open up the tray. Now, once the tray is open, we both realize there's another problem here: he's far too short to reach the pancakes themselves, even holding the tongs. So, I motion with my hand for him to give me the tongs, and I motion towards the pancakes as if to ask, ""how many?"" He held up 2 fingers, and I put them onto his plate (he had put his plate on the table holding the tray of pancakes, a couple of inches away from the little flame underneath the pancake tray).So, I went back to getting my own pancakes, and put two on my plate. I closed the plate and put the tongs back on their dish. I looked down and the kid had just finished pouring his maple syrup on his pancakes. I thought that he's going to just hand me the maple syrup, but instead he made a little pouring motion and nodded. So, I lowered my hand so my plate was in front of him, and he poured some syrup onto my pancakes, until I nodded for him to stop. He put the cap back onto the syrup, put it back on the table, and walked away. I went back to my own table, and start to tell my story. A few seconds in, I looked over to where he walked off to and found his table, and he was pointing at me and talking to his parents. And you know what his parents did? Gave me a genuine smile and a waveThat moment gave me a little bit of faith in humanity. Me and this kid didn't speak one word to each other, yet we were able to communicate. He could have been Asian-American, or from Asia itself, yet that didn't matter. He wasn't scared of the (somewhat) tall, tanned brown skin man standing above him. He knew I wanted to help, and in return he helped me (although I kind of let him help me, lowering my hand so he could actually pour the syrup). Sometimes I just think of this encounter and get reminded that there's good in the world.",3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBSZL89,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBSZL89
