But you know, it was really fun! I was really happy with the atmosphere. I felt like a little kid again, I guess? Like, after all the stress I've gone through with work and all, it was nice to cut back and finally act like a kid again. I know her son smashed his face into the cake instead of letting his mom cut it, and I couldn't stop laughing. She was PISSED, though, because she had spent around $100 on this really nice cake from this really reputable baker. It was hilarious. Like, I kept myself from laughing too much, but the look of horror on her face didn't help. I would've liked some cake, but we settled for some ice cream they had leftover in the fridge. I bought him a nerf gun, so I hope she likes having that around the house now--not my problem. She'll probably regret inviting me, but I really am thankful for her letting me come over and just relax. Her son is adorable, and I really did need the down time. I'm just really happy she noticed how sad I was and let me come. After, she gave me a hug goodbye before I got into my car, and assured me that everything would be ok and that I should relax more--and that if I was having any more problems, I was always welcome to hang out with her when she wasn't busy with her son. I felt really nice about it, I just felt wanted. I'm just writing out my thoughts so I don't forget, I guess it was really important to me. Maybe I'll take her up on her offer.",,3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V95ZDB0G
