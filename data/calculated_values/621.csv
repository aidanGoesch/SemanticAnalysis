We did not know if he was gonna make it. He is alive and in recovery so everything  is ok right now. I guess when you turn fifty and sixty years old your heart wants to show you it's time to get healthy. I hope he uses the experience to be more healthy in his lifestyle. He was working out of state so he is in a hospital four hours away. I might drive up after work. I would hate to not see him if something turns out the wrong way. I just decided to go. If he has complications and I can't see him and he passes away I could not live with myself. I'm still very scared for him. This is your heart. It goes bad and it is over. He had a major tear to his aorta. The survival rate is low. We are incredibly lucky.,,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP
