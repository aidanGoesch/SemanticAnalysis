I had to travel back to my hometown to attend it, it was about an hour away. She made the party fox themed and It was very fun however I had bought a nice toy truck for him. I was the first to arrive there besides my bestfriend. So we had time to hang out with her son. After an hour or so The other guests started to arrive. Everyone began to eat and chat about . 2 hours in She brought out a smash cake for her son and put it on the floor. He had a blast with destroying it and eating it I believe watching him do that was the most memorable event. It was so funny and entertaining! After that the birthday presents were presented to him. He acted like he didn't have any interest in most of  them though!  But he did take an interest in a bouncy swing thing my friend put him in. I believe he trully loved it as he was giggling and bouncing about. Overall the party was really fun. Just before nightfall however is when I left.",3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V95ZDB0G,3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V95ZDB0G
