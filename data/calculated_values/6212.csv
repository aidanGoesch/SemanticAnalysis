Around Christmas time I started to really notice how many people were struggling around me. I knew it happened, but somehow I never really thought too much about it. About 2 weeks ago now, I was walking down the road on my way to get a cup of coffee before doing some Christmas shopping and I saw a bunch of businesses with people curled up outside them. Trying to keep themselves warm with blankets, sleeping bags and hats. Those were the lucky ones. I saw ones that were just huddled up inside doorways doing their best to stay warm and alive with empty cups in front of them, or signs. Just begging people to help them out with the basic needs that every human being needs and deserves. I don't know what it was that made me notice today of all days. Maybe because I was out spending too much money on Christmas presents that really weren't that needed when there are people who can't even afford a hot meal. I spotted one guy sitting there with just a small blanket, though he wasn't using the blanket, the blanket was curled around a small dog, who looked as though he had seen better days. I dug into my pockets and checked what I had for cash, and it wasn't much. I stopped to talk to him, and learned he had been laid off 2 years ago and lost his home and has no family near by. I talked to him for a bit learning that he found the dog abandoned one day and decided to keep him. His money that he gets from panhandling goes to feeding his dog, who is his best friend. I asked him if he was hungry and he looked at me quite surprised and said he was starving, he was lucky to eat at all each day. He asked a friend of his a few feet away to watch his dog, and off we went to get some lunch. I picked up some sandwiches for the others that I spotted and some hot cups of coffee, and of course a bag of dog food for his buddy. We delivered the food, and I've never seen such joy before. It was a good moment, I made a lot of people happy, but most of all, I made myself happy.",,3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V9G5TB0J
