WHEN I SAW THAT INCIDENT I WAS DEPRESSED MENTALLY VERY BAD. NOW A DAYS OUR WORLD IS FACED SO MANY PROBLEMS. THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS THAT POVERTY. I REMEMBER THIS SITUATION AT THAT TIME.  AT THAT TIME THE CHILD WAS CAME TO NEAR ME. THAT TIME I FELL VERY SAD AND HE WAS ASKING TO ME FOR FOOD. I BROUGHT SOME FOOD FROM THE NEAREST SHOP AND GAVE IT TO HIM. HE WAS VERY HAPPY. I REALIZE THAT THE BIGGEST REQUIREMENT IN THE WORLD IS FOOD. IT WAS A MEMMORABLE EVENT IN MY LIFE.,,3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V9G5TB0J
