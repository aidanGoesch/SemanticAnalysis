I've lived here now for 5 months, so it still feels new to me. Last March, I had no plans to buy a home. An ad online caught my attention and I was linked to a home for sale in my local area. The house had just been vacated and was well above my price range. I couldn't get the house out of my mind however. I eventually asked my realtor friend just to show me around for fun. I visited the home on a snowy weekend and was greeting by a warm and spacious home. I instantly fell in love. I could imagine living here making memories for years to come. I went home determined to save until I could buy this house. I pooled all of my resources, I even borrowed money from family. I was able to gather the down payment I needed in just a few weeks time. By the time I was ready to put down an offer, I received word that the house already had a pending offer. I was really upset for awhile. I looked at other homes online but this one just felt like the one for me. I moved on and just decided to wait to see what houses went on the market come springtime. Out of the blue a few weeks later, my realtor calls to tell me that the offer on the house fell through. I put in my own offer and it was accepted the same day! I'm just so grateful for how everything worked out and have so much to look forward to.",,3X4JMASXCNVG2VYF1TWEL8V9GYA0BB
