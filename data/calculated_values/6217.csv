I travelled, with a few family members, to a local city I hadn't been to in a while. We planned to visit an area I was not familiar with. We wanted to visit a local restaurant and a hobby related store in the area. I had been excited to go, and it ended up being definitely worth it. First, we had to find parking. We got a little lost on the way to our first destination, but it only wasted five or so minutes. We got to the restaurant, which was fairly easy to spot from a distance. I was excited to try an extremely spicy ethnic dish here. I didn't actually end up getting what I had planned to, but it was still quite an experience. The food was probably the hottest thing I have ever eaten. Afterwards, we went down the street to a hobby-related store. I was feeling almost dazed because of the food, but I was able to carry on after resting for just a moment or two. I was sweating pretty hard from the food, but I probably looked worse than I felt. I let everyone know I was fine, but just that we should take it easy, because we were not in a hurry. After walking for just a few minutes, we got to our seconds destination. It was a board game related store that was, to be honest, just a bit disappointing. I wanted to buy three things there, but could only find one thing, and it wasn't actually exactly what I wanted. Later on, I was also sort of mad at myself, because there was something I realized I should have bought. I bought it online later and had to pay for more shipping and tax costs than I otherwise would have. After this, we were supposed to go home, but we stopped at a bar that was on the way for a few minutes. I kind of wanted to just go and play the game we bought, but I wasn't opposed to just relaxing for another ten minutes. We went home and proceeded to play. I managed to win pretty convincingly. It was a nice opportunity to break up my daily routine, I think.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9H8J7RWT
