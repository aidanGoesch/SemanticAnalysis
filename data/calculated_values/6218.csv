I just couldn't take the stress anymore. I have really bad anxiety, and I'm working with someone to find a way to control it. But it just wasn't worth the toll on my mental health to continue to go to school. But now I'm even more stressed out because of all the student loan debt I have. I don't really know what I need to do, but I'm really worried. I know that my mental health is more important logically, but there is a seperate part of my brain that doesn't care. It's really frustrating trying to cope with the battle going on in my brain. I hope that I can figure something out because I don't know what to do. I think I may try to defer my loans, at least for a bit. I don't know why there is so much cost associated with going to college. I wanted to do what is best for me and my future family, but now I feel like I have just really screwed up and made things worse for everyone. I don't know what to do. Possible ideas to solve the problems:Go to a therapistGet on medicationdefer student loanstalk to my parentsdo none of this and mope about my life. Really, I'm not sure what to do. I know, I keep writing that, but it's true.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HQQ3WRQ
