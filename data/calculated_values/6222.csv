On Fathers day I have a bbq  and invite my sons family over. My grandson has his birthday shortly after Fathers Day so we combine the two. We had so much fun with the kids and having everyone over also. I have a younger grandson his brother, and we have a yard bbq party for him also now in August. Last time he got a helium balloon  for him and I and he accidently released ir. We all wathed the balloon for a long time and got it on video. He watched it after about 10 minutes it disappeared. We all so much look forward to our yearly bbq now. We are planning another next year. I have wore out my bbqer and need to get a new one for next year. We always have good weather in June for the occasion. I go out of my way to get the yard looking good. We usually have 3 to 4 bbqs each summer. Hope to have a great one again this year.",3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HW69WRY,
