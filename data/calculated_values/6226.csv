D. programs last winter and was only admitted to a third M.A. in April without funding. I was devastated. All my hard work didn't seem to be paying off. I considered, ""Should I just re-apply to funded Ph. D.'s another field closer to my already existing M.A.'s? I would probably have better chances in Religious Studies/Asian Studies..."" The place where I was accepted for a third M.A. had a good program in Philosophy, but expensive location. I literally had no savings whatsoever so even moving there, much less housing and feeding myself, would be a struggle. I have faculty support from the two M.A.'s I already received, but only one faculty member (and letter writer) is in Philosophy while the other two are in Religious Studies. Prior to applying, one of my current mentors suggested looking into ""better"" schools, telling me a degree from the places I applied won't get me a job in the future and that there is no existing network connecting my letter writers to anyone in the new department. The same person suggested if I applied to [""better"" school, where said person is an alumnus and former admissions committee member], I may have a better chance due to connections. Except [""better"" school], while an ""ivy league"" university, does not feature anything like my ideal program. My ideal program is strong in both ""Western"" and ""Eastern"" philosophy (and/or religion) and encourages interdisciplinary scholarship. A program I considered a good match made a less-than-ideal offer (bumping my application from Ph. D. to M.A., without funding for even basic necessities) nearing the last minute, leaving little time to make an informed decision. Now I still struggle to figure out what to do next, after receiving this sort of rejection. I have applied to graduate school four times, two times with success, and two times without. I will need to re-take the GRE and reconsider where to apply, if at all, for future educational pursuits. It has been extremely discouraging.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HX0RWR5
