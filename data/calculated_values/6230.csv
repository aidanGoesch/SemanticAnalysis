He's only 33, but everything points to this conclusion. He is married and has 2 children, but he seems to be driving himself to destruction. All of this is on account of another woman. A woman who entered his life and turned it upside down. It's in his best interests, in many ways, to stay with his wife and family. But he just can't seem to do it. He's drawn to this other woman and it seems he will pull himself down to be with her. I've talked with him at length about this, but it's like speaking to a stone. Everything falls by the wayside when it comes to this woman. I know this woman doesn't feel the same way about him, but he thinks he can force it. I told him, love can't be forced. But, in a manner typical to him, he is trying anyway, arguing with her that they are in a relationship even when they truly aren't. She is in love with another man and is honest with him about it. Still, he doesn't seem to understand. Or, he thinks he can talk her out of it. In the meantime, his family is lost and his reputation collapses.",3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HZSNRWI,
