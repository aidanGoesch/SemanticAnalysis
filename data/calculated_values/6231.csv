He was leaving his wife and needed someone to turn to. That person was me. I was able to give him advice and tried to see things from his point of view. He was torn between trying to repair his relationship and going after a different one. I gave him my thoughts on both options. I gave him the good points and bad, as I saw them. In the end, he took neither choice. I would have never expected him to do this, but he did. His best option was to get his wife back, which he could have done easily, but he went another way. He decided to be with a woman who is probably not the best choice for him. She is a bit of a scandalous woman. I feel like my friend is being self destructive. I can't stop him from living his life. I did the best I could for him.",3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HZSNRWI,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HZSNRWI
