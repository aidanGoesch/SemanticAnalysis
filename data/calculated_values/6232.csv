Traveling alone is something she never did, and thought she would ask me if I would go with her. I took some some time away from work and we booked the trip to go to Columbia. I was so excited because I love traveling, and being able to go to a place where you can emerge in another culture is exciting to me. We arrived in Columbia and couldn't wait to start exploring the culture and sites that we wanted to see. The first stop was definitely a place to sit and eat so we can take it all in. As waiting for our food to arrive I couldn't help but not to just want to stare at everything and everyone. It is amazing to see them do what they do everyday. There was so much stuff we wanted to see and do and be part of. After eating we came across a younger lady who spoke a little english. We asked her if she could help us by guiding us around. We first stopped at a market there well we shopped for clothing and home made apparel. It was amazing to see that these women put these materials together and created beautiful pieces. After leaving the market there was some events taking place nearby. The event was traveling as a single woman abroad. I was a little hesitant at first but knew I wanted to take advantage of every opportunity I had. So it was a train ride threw this historic place where you really got to see how the people in Columbia lived. It was something I'm glad that I did and took part of. After a long day we both went back to our rooms, where the next day we flew back home. The most amazing event was talking to local Colombians in Spanish. Learning and using Spanish was also the most challenging task for me during my journey.",,3X65QVEQI19C9WF74MESUCTFAEQLCK
