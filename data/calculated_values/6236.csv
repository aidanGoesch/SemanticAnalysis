I try not to take it for granted. My friend, who I was reasonably close to, had started getting serious with his girlfriend. I tried my best to make the experience good for them. I invited them up to Martha's Vineyard for a nice little getaway. We coordinated times over the course of a few days. We were able to see some llamas happily grazing in the fields. We also ate some fantastic food, and I was introduced to places I hadn't been to yet. It was hard to take this time to just take a step back and appreciate everything. It was all like a whirlwind. It all was happening so fast. I didn't really want it to end. The best part was that at no point did I ever feel like a third wheel. I felt like it was just three friends hanging out and enjoying each other's company. We ended the little vacation by relaxing on the beach.",,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDW42G3E
