From a young age, I was sort of her protector. When she was diagnosed as having epilepsy, it only further solidified my role as her protector, and even though she sees me that way, I still see her as my best friend every bit as much as I used to. I am older than her, though we are very close in age. We were only one grade apart in school. I took care of her when mom and dad couldn't. I looked after her and saved her from bullies in school. Things changed a bit after school. I left home, went to college, and because of this I moved pretty far away. I don't see her as much as I used to. I miss her so dearly and I know that she misses me. I still go to see her as often as I can, and when I do, we always do something fun. I know that she is sick, but she doesn't see it that way. She is so courageous. Even though she is my little sister, I want to be just like her.",,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDWUXG3P
