We have an elder sister but because she move out the house early so I was responsible to take charge on taking care of my little sister.  Growing up was so easy for us to enjoy because we have each others back. I would always protect her and she will always be my shoulder to cry on.  Then there came the time that I had to leave the house and marry my husband. I think it was a heartbreaking and emotional part of leaving her and wont be able to see her for a long time. I had to stay of different side of the country. Five months ago, I had a call from my mom and she was sobbing. I was so scared why she was acting like that. Then she told me the big news that my little sister was diagnosed with Epilepsy. I felt my jaw dropped and my body is numb. I couldnt hear anyone and all the things just turned blank. Tears fell on my cheeks and there my little sister came. I didnt saw all the signs but my mother said it happened when I was away from home. She was able to keep the secret from me because she knew I wont leave her if I knew that was happening to her. She is a very brave on handling the Epilepsy. She had all the test and taking medication to prevent her from falling and jerking. I cant believe my sister is going thru this pain. She was positive in her outlook in life and she told me that is everything is okay and dont want me to think about it. She said she accept and dont want to dwell into negativity. But thank God for a new chapter of her life",,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDWUXG3P
