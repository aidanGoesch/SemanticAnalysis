I move when I went through a divorce.  I didn't know anyone.  I didn't even really leave my house except to go shopping for the first two years.  I finally met a woman.  She became my girlfriend. But, I still didn't have any friends.  My family lives literally a thousand miles away.  I felt very lonely during this time. She started working at a bar a few months ago. I would go and pick her up and have a few drinks with her.  Some of the regular people that she worked with started talking to me. Luckily I became friends with them.  It brought me out of my shell.  Now I have an active social life and people that I can turn to locally for support when I need it.",3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDXYM3GA,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDXYM3GA
