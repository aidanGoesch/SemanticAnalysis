My son joked that all grandmothers say things like that. I meant it. All growing up, she has a spark about her that was special. She was caring and smart. She really enjoy business and how businesses worked. When she was 7, she had her own lemonade stand and was smart enough to see that there was a demand and slightly marked up prices. We told her that might be price gauging and she should not do that. Other than that, she had a knack for it. Soon, she was graduating. We knew that she wanted to be in business. How could we not know? It's all she ever liked! After she graduated, she came home and wanted us to go out to dinner with her. She had huge news. We expected a pregnancy or a marriage. We were beside ourselves when she said she was getting a job at our state's capital! She had went in for an interview and they loved her! She said she was going to be heading the business division for the state! We were all so proud of her and now she's doing huge things for our state!",,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDYLE3GD
