She graduated from business school a few months ago.  She applied for different jobs.  She got a real good job at our states capital.  I am very proud of her.  She saved up enough money to buy a real nice car.  She eventually wants to rent an apartment close to her job.  She is looking for apartments right now.  I am very close to my granddaughter.  She stops in to see me a lot when she comes home from work.  I am always cooking for her.  I bake for her too.  I know her favorite dishes.   She is just a wonderful girl.  She is very kind and thoughtful.  I am very lucky to have her as my granddaughter.,,3X66WABAJX48A45N026BOHKDYLE3GD
