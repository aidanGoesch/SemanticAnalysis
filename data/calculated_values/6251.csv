I decided to apply at a well-known retail chain. They are famous for having good benefits and paying a living wage. I went in to apply for the job and had a really good interview. Both people conducting the interview seemed to like me. I was ready for all their questions. I felt at ease. I was quickly called back for a second interview. I didn't feel the same level of rapport that I had in the first interview. Even though it didn't go as well as the first round, i still thought I was a great fit for this company. I waited for a couple weeks and I started to feel nervous. Finally they called and told me they weren't going to hire me. I was beginning to feel hopeful. I was pretty devastated as I needed a job with a future. I'm still looking for a good job.",3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKI4OHNG,
