I don't relish the telling. A few weeks ago I walked into a newly-opening business with an application in hand. I was optimistic, excited, nervous. I was greeted by an employee that did a short screening of my application and she told me that they'd be happy to give me an on-the-spot interview. I was elated! This was a great job, in my field, with great benefits. I waited some time, restlessly, and was finally called to a corner for an interview. It went so swimmingly. It felt like I had acquitted myself well. They told me I'd hear from them in a few weeks. All the tension that led me to that moment came out as I was leaving in the form of happy nervous energy and I went home to celebrate and imagine how I feel with this job. I was so surprised when they called me the next day! I arranged a second interview and even though I felt my answers weren't as well received, I thought I was perfect for this job. I was told they'd call me in a few weeks. A week went by. I started to feel apprehensive. I got a call this week that they decided NOT to offer me the job. I was floored. Reeling. It felt like a gut punch. I had begun to imagine this job as mine, and it was gone.",3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKI4OHNG,3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKI4OHNG
