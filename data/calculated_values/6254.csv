Sharon is my first daughter while shares the same birthday with my wife Linda, I have always love Sharon for and beauty and personality, strong and charismatic. She could be funny also as i always am also. When Sharon told me she wanted to study medicine, i was so happy because i always wanted it.  We gave Sharon all the support needed. She also putting all her effort came out of college a surgeon. I wasn't too surprised when i received the news that she graduated top of the class. May 20, 2019 is the happiest moment i could remember this year as my light Sharon celebrates her graduation. She puts n the best smile i have ever seen. I couldn't be more happier than a father who sees Sharon who struggled to survive infant age. When Sharon was diagnosed of leukemia at 5 year old, She struggled for three years, so much pain all through so she coming out was so good for us. May 20, my daughter Sharon is getting married. i was just so happy leading Sharon down the aisle to her husband. With tears all around the hall as i make a special appreciation presentation showing all the pictures of Sharon during Chemo and days in the hospital. There were so emotional a moment, up to the moments of joy of the funny children displays, elementary school days, college days and her graduation... It was just an exciting time. No one could which for a more lucky daughter. The wedding ceremony was so interesting, the best moment is taking a tango dance with my daughter. Sharon made the best out of everything that has happened to us as a family.",,3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKSY5HNV
