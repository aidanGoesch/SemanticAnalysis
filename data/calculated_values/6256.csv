It was kind of nerve wracking getting ready for it since I hadn't done anything like this since like going on a date since early 2000s. I had no idea what to wear, what I would say or how to act. We had decided to go out to dinner so I made sure to bring gum so my breath wouldn't smell after eating. We met at the restaurant and it was pretty awkward at first. We kind of hugged and introduced ourselves. I remember sweating a little because I was pretty nervous about this date with such a beautiful woman. I was wondering what she was thinking when we were seated at the table. We quickly ordered and then just started chatting about our interests. I made sure to order something easy to eat like chicken strips. I didn't want to make a huge mess or look like a pig. After about 10 minutes of chatting about what we liked to do and what we didn't like to do, the conversation flowed much more easily. I wasn't nervous anymore and she seemed more at ease. Our food finally came and neither of us ate much of our meals. That was probably because we didn't want to seem like pigs in front of each other on a first date. We then finished and went out to a bar for a couple of drinks. We had fun and really had a good time.",,3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WR6K9QSC
