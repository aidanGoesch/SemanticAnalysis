Something was wrong, as we tried in the past 2 years. Was it her or me? We had tests performed only once. The doctor found no reason why we could not have a child. Sex was not just sex to us, as we were married now for 5 years. However, both of us had careers, and they were demanding. She was an astronaut and spent 4 months of the 12 months in space and traveling from west to east and north to south coasts. I was an insurance salesperson and traveled almost as much, but not in space. But I spent every extra dollar I earned on airplane flight lessons. We both loved being in the air. I did not qualify for space travel because of my health. I have 2 artificals legs. I was in the U.S. Space Force and lost my legs on my first deployment in space in a space shuttle that crashed landed. Maybe it is my fault that we do not have a baby by now. It is all my fault, I just feel it in my few bones I have.",,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G9MTMN2
