She is four years old and obsessed with princesses and Mickey and Minnie Mouse. This was to be a magical opportunity. Unfortunately in the time leading up to  the trip, two  things happened to get in the way of successful travel. First, my oldest daughter who is mentally ill had to be admitted to a long-term residential program. She was originally supposed to come on the trip with us but now this would no longer be possible. There was also the added stress of needing to be near by her while she was hospitalized and my anxiety about traveling during this time. The second  event was a back surgery, desperately needed, scheduled for my husband just twelve days before we were set to depart. He had his surgery and it went well, but he developed a hematoma and was in terrible paid. Despite this, we decided we didn't want to miss out on this opportunity. My oldest daughter was disappointed she couldn't go, but we promised her a makeup trip and she felt better. I was able to visit with her right before we left. We drove to Orlando and rented my husband a motorized scooter to get around. Despite his discomfort, my husband agreed that this vacation was well worth it. It was such a joy to see our four year old girl enraptured by the magic all around her. It was Disney's most crowded day of the year and we were under a heat advisory but we kept a positive attitude, made the best of a bad situation, and had an amazing time.",3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WRV1TQSJ,3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WRV1TQSJ
