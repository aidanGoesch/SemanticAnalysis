It was a hot afternoon with a bit of a gust, but otherwise it was pleasant. We weren't sure if the cats would be active or not, but to our surprise some were! The most memorable part for me was the first exhibit, which was a cheetah. The cheetah was lying down on the opposite side of the enclosure, but when it saw us coming it walked right up to all of us and started purring like a house cat! We all took videos and pictures and the animal was just hamming it up for the camera, it was a lot of fun! I'm a big animal lover, especially cats, so this experience really moved me and made me feel happy. Before this trip I didn't know cheetahs could purr! A lot of the other cats were pretty laid back that day, but a few were active. We got to see a rare sand cat, as well as jaguars and snow leapords! They even had a white bengal tiger, she was so beautiful and had ice blue eyes. We plan to go back again soon. Seeing all the big cats so up close and personal made me feel very connected to nature and happy. Everyone had a wonderful time and learned quite a bit about the big cats we all saw! My favorites were the cheetah and bengal tiger.",,3XC1O3LBOT8TVDHIQ89IJMTJYZQTL9
