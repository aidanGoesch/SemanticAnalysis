I worked continually to give her the best 14th birthday a mom could give her daughter with little money to do.  It took me about a week to construct everything that was needed , built an outside couch with scrap wood and a movie screen , so the projector collecting dust could finally have purpose. Nonetheless , after working tirelessly to construct everything it all came together with some hard work. The L shaped couch was built , with two air mattresses , solar lights where put up so they could see, projector was set up , tent was put up so she could have a sleep over in the same area. Nonetheless , the say had finally arrived when all my hardwood would pay off. My daughter turned the corner to see all i had done for her , and she immediately began to cry! Tears of joy of course, but she couldn't believe what i had don and how much it looked so wonderful. Later that day her friends arrived and were also astonished. I had popcorn , full size candy bars, pizza, and cooler full of sodas. They had a blast, and i could hear her friends saying how cool i was and couldn't believe your mom did this. It made me feel wonderful that all my hard-work paid off. But the best part was that my daughter will never forget her 14th birthday. Ever child should have memorable moments like this during there childhood and im just so happy i was able to pull it off.  I dont think i will ever forget myself , since it took so much work to put together. But in the end the tears rolling down my daughter face and enjoyment she had with her friends will last lifetime for both her and I.",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0GKQRU,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0GKQRU
