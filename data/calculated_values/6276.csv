She and her fiancee (now husband) were married on a small hobby farm about 45 minutes away. They wanted to get married in a field, which is what they got: a small meadow in a grove of old-growth oaks.  The weather was unseasonably cool, and basically perfect: blue sky with fluffy white clouds, only about 80 degrees, and not a drop of rain.  I finally know what they mean when they say a bride looks radiant: I've never seen Jane looking so happy! The ceremony was conducted by Uncle Tad. He made some moving remarks. Afterwards, we took tractors and trams across the highway to a little ""lodge"" and retreat center.  I saw so many of our friends and family and it was great to reminisce and play ""catch up"" with them. I gave a toast that I worked on for weeks, and Jane cried a little. Dinner was excellent and we danced the night away! I also made a lot of new friends, including a college friend of my sister's. She and I really hit it off! I got her phone number and we have been texting almost every day! All in all the day was beautiful and wonderful--just like Jane. It was a perfect day, just like she deserved.",,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0OYRQP
