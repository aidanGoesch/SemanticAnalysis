I had a blast meeting my family. I gave my sister a big hug. I gave my brother a handshake. I shared a beer with my father. I had some wine with my mother. I played horse shoes with my cousins. I won the game and celebrated my win with some cake. We all got together to perform karaoke. Most of the people were drunk, so they didn't mind singing. I almost fell over while singing. I was too drunk to sing. I had to sit down for the rest of the day. I still had a ton of fun at the reunion. I went home with some great memories of the event. It was a great time.",,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02GX74NM8
