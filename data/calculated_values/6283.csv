Both my parents and siblings were so worried because she had been suffering with her illness for a while now. she looked so tired and she was complaining of having so much pain on reaching at the hospital the doctors told us that she was in a critical condition and she had to be rushed to the emergency room. We waited for the doctor for almost 30 minutes without hearing nothing from the doctors,everybody was getting very anxious because we didn't know what was happening to our little girl. My mother was walking all over talking to all the nurses trying to find out what was going on with her doctor. After an hour the doctor that was taking care of my sister came out and his face looked a bit worried just looking at him my mother started crying because she thought something bad had happened to her little girl. The doctor came over and told us that he was very sorry because she was dead. i felt like the world was coming to an end all i could see is darkness all over the room i don't remember what happened next i only woke up to find myself in a hospital bed that's when i remembered that my little sister was no more. i immediately started screaming and asked my mother why did this have to happen to her when she was only eight years old my mother couldn't say anything she was just seated besides me weeping uncontrollably. she was my best friend my confident someone i could turn to whenever i had a problem now she was no more. my dad came into the room and told me to take heart because everything happened for a reason and i should thank God because she had been suffering for a while now with the sickness. i got out of bed and demanded to be taken to my sister so that i could see her body. she was lying there so innocent it was very painful watching her sleeping so lifeless. It was like the world was coming to an end. loosing her was very painful and i always think of her. i loved her so much until now i miss her so much",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV86IRQH,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV86IRQH
