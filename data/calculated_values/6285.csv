It was a boring meeting until he told me that he wanted to talk to another co-worker of mine. He said I should go into a conference room and get him because he was meeting with someone else. I had never done that so I was a little worried about busting into another meeting but I trusted what my boss told me. As I rounded the corner to the conference room - I could hear voices but I didn't think anything of it. I went into the room and everyone shouted ""Surprise!"" I was so shocked! They had organized the whole thing. The main organizer was a co-worker who had just started working there! They had presents for me and a donut shaped cake. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to me. It was really awesome and touching. I couldn't believe that they put so much effort into organizing such a nice gesture for me. They gave me some donut socks and a pair of donut covered pj pants that I love. They really know me and what I like! I think everyone enjoyed just getting a break and not having to work. We always laugh and joke with each other when we get a chance like that. Plus the cake was delicious!",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV9ZARQW,
