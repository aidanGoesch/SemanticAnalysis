It was a complete surprise to me. It really made me emotional because I didn't expect anything for my birthday. My boss called me into his office and mentioned that he wanted one of our other co-workers to be in attendance. He asked me to go get him out of another meeting he was in. When I went to the conference room to find him, all of my co-workers yelled ""Surprise!"" and totally shocked me! I started to tear up because it was such a sweet gesture. The person who organized the whole thing was a new co-worker who didn't even know me very well. They had a cake and even some donut related presents. I love donuts so this made me very happy. We all stood around and ate the very delicious, donut-shaped cake. One of my other co-workers had made it especially for me. I felt so well-loved that day. Even thinking about it now makes me smile. I tell people about it all the time and my co-worker who organized it is now one of my good friends!",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV9ZARQW,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV9ZARQW
