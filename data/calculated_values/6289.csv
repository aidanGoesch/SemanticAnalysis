This weird lady came and asked if she could see my record collection in my room, I just assumed she was part of the party downstairs and I showed her my records and I let her listen to them. After a while she left my room. I then discovered this woman was not part of the party. It turns out that this woman was a random addict that just saw a party going on and had just walked into the house.  I still have no idea how she knew I had a record collection in my room. the whole thing was just messed up and weird. We called the police who stated she was breaking into multiple houses. She actually stabbed one of my neighbors while he was in the shower. Thankfully, my neighbor is recovering. I do not understand how she made it to my house after she attacked so many people before us. Did anyone call? Where were the police? I just do not understand! It was one of the most after-scary things thatâ€™s ever happened to me.",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRVBO5RQ7,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRVBO5RQ7
