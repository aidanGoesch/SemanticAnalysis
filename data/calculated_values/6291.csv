This is usually my favorite time of year, but this year is different. We have only been in our new house since March and my family is finally starting to get comfortable living back in the city with a neighbor on each side. For the seven years prior we lived out in the country and loved our privacy. We had bonfires every fall, parties, and my kids had the woods to have adventures in. Now that we are in the city my 12 year old son has become noticeably depressed and withdrawn. He doesn't want to go outside or even come out of his room. At first I thought it might be the move, but that is not the issue.   Night before last I asked him to come in my room and have a talk. I asked what was going on with him. He sat there and began to sob and cry. Finally after a few minutes of me reassuring him that there was nothing to big or bad that we can't handle it together. What he told me completely blew my mind. He preceded to tell me about how he has always felt different and then said he felt like he was supposed to be born a girl. I tried not to let my jaw hit the floor. I asked him to elaborate and he said that he had felt that way for a long time but was afraid to say anything. He then told me that he would preferred to be called by a female version of his name and would like for us to refer to him by that name and by the pronoun she. I hugged her and told her we would do whatever we could to make her be comfortable and if that was calling her a different name or anything else that would make exploring this easier for her. Honestly it is one of the hardest things I have faced with any of my three children. I consider myself to be open-minded and progressive, but when it's your child, all of that goes out the window. I love all of my children and have always assured  them that there is nothing we can't face together. So now it's time for me to back that up with action. I want to help her be comfortable with who she is regardless of what gender she identifies with, but I at the same time my heart breaks for the painful journey that I know she faces. People are mean and while society is more accepting than it used to be, it's still scary. I have no idea what the future holds for us, but I will do my best to support my child and do whatever it takes to ensure her safety while she figures out who she is!",,3XIQGXAUMDU1X910RO95PKWOG9N7X7
