She was so excited to have a pool party with her friends and family. I had spent weeks planning it out for her, so that everything would run smoothly. At the last minute, I decided we should go adopt a dog on the same day. So, we went to the store and got all of her birthday supplies and cake. After that, we drove to the animal shelter. When I got there, I realized I had left my wallet at the store. I couldn't adopt a dog without my ID. So, we left disappointed. I ended up feeling frustrated about letting the kids down about the dog and cried. My mom got mad at me for crying. It was a mess. The party ended up being fun.
