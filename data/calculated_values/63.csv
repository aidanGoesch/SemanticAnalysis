The cake that was bought for me on the day of my retirement by my wife was awesome. The price of the cake was very high. But, while the cake was coming form the kitchen to the hall were the party was going on, it was spilled on one of my friend as the hand was touched by another person. This spoiled the cake and the whole cake was on my friend. Now, I was not having any cake to cut. However, they were all laughing very badly. They were happy and at the same time were sad. This was the worst that can happen. The cake was very much awesome. However, my wife another cake in a matter of time. It get very much nice  to have a wife who can get the cake that fast. It was a pleasant moment for me. That friend was very much embarrassed. He was also not that happy. But, however, it ended nicely.",,30H4UDGLT34F936W931DEP7BR61PM0
