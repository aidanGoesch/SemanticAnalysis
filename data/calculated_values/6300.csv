My brother brought his kid over to to introduce me, he's only a couple of months old. I was kind of apathetic to the whole thing but I figured I would humor my brother and be a good uncle. When he brought that little guy over, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Diapers had always been a big turn off for me and kids always just seemed like useless bags of flesh to me, not something I could really have much affection for. But when I held him in my arms, he smiled at me with such a warm smile it melted my heart. All those preconceptions I had about him before were gone and I suddenly realized why people love babies. They're so warm and untainted by all the things that ruin people as they get older. In a way they're like animals, just consciousness in its purest form and I find it really remarkable and sweet. I believe in the future I'll try to have kids if I meet the right woman. In the mean time I'll enjoy playing with his son and getting to know him though. I hope that I like the toddler stage as much as the baby stage. I hear that they can be a real handful at that age.  But for now, he's a little bundle of joy and I look forward to seeing him again. I'm especially looking forward to taking him to his first sporting event and seeing how he reacts.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFFAZ7O
