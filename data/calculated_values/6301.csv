I have never cared for, wanted or even liked children. I have never held a baby - I have never wanted to. They seem irritating and look like big nasty grubs. My wife and I have never wanted kids, we could not afford them, we both struggle with depression, and barely have enough time to make it through the day on our own. Also just having a forty-hour a week job prevents me from getting enough sleep as I should. I could not imagine functioning without sleep and caring for a child. So I was ambivalent about my brother have a kid and being an uncle. The day after he was born I went to the hospital to visit them out of politeness. His wife, my sister-in-law was asleep fro medication - she had to have a c-section, my mom and her mom were there. When I came in my mom was holding the baby, and she asked if I wanted to hold him. I figured I should. I sat down and they gently gave him to me. He seemed so light and he was sleepy. It was awkward holding him at first, my mom took a photo of me literally ten seconds after passes the child to me. A change came over me, I held this little child and I realized I care for him. I want to be a good uncle and want to see him succeed and I can't wait to buy him gifts. I think this is because the kid is a blood relative - he has my blood in him. People say that when I tell them I don't like kids - most say ""You'll like your own"". It's true, I can about my nephew. I could sleep that night when I heard he had to go to intensive care. Every thing was okay - just a normal test. So I went from almost despising children to loving one, and I think it's only because I can feel that he is a blood relative.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFFAZ7O
