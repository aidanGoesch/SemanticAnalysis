He is beautiful with this long blonde mane and tail and a gorgeous yellow body. He seriously looks like he is right out of a fairy tale. He is the absolute sweetest boy ever. I think he would spend hours just letting you brush on him and give him attention. He loves to have his ears scratched and makes the most adorable face when you do. I have been looking for a horse just like him for months. I went out on a limb to purchase him because he was not exactly what I was looking for, but from the minute I saw him I knew it was love. He has only had one other owner his whole life so I know his background and training. He has no hidden ghosts in his closet, unlike Bourbon. His name was Tucker but he is being renamed to Butter because he really does look like a stick of butter. My daughter loves him and thinks that he is just the best thing ever. She has now renamed several of her toy horses after him. I am ecstatic that I found him and that he is going to work out perfect for us. Now he just has to stay in his pasture and not escape!",3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFGM7ZA,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFGM7ZA
