It was about 3 weeks ago when we took our kids to college. That morning before we left, I went in their room to wake them up and found them  in their beds with heads covered, black blanket on their pillows .I know it sounds childish but  I loved everything about my boys. We moved all their stuff into their dorms and that actually took more than i expected. They had a lot stuff that needed to be carried. Leaving the parking lot with them  waving was just about the hardest moment of our life. I just knew they would be happier at college than they were in high school, and that they started a new chapter too. My other two kids teased me about how I would fall apart as we left. I felt victorious, like we had achieved a goal as a family. Never try to talk and give last-minute instructions , while hugging them for the last time before driving away. Neither his Dad, nor two sisters, or I could say a word for the next two hours. The dropping off was not the issue, the coming home and looking at an empty room was more of a heartbreaker. Up to the day a combination of fear and extreme pride is in me that my boys will achieve their dreams together. At the end of the day when we got home me and my husband cried. Our family is never the same and the house is too quiet and this is only after 3 weeks.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFJE7Z8
