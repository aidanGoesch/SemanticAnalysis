I was determined to be the great mom that helped them move in and didn't cry or annoy them. However, that is not as easy as it seemed in my head. We had a hard time fitting everything in the car. After all, two college bound kids means two of everything. But after trying a few times, we got the important stuff in the car. The rest of it were items that we could pick up in the town where the kids' college was. So a few laundry baskets microwaves were left behind for me to return to the store later. The next morning, we all got in the car. The drive was longer than I thought it would be. We missed a turned and got mixed up. Then there was a detour and that messed us up. But we finally arrived, although late. Good thing we drove up a day early. So the next day dawned and we headed to the school to unload. It was hot and humid. The kids' dorm didn't have an elevator! But they were living on the fourth floor. All that lugging of fridges, clothes, books, tvs up those stairs made us hot, tired, and bit cranky. When the time came to say goodbye I did end up crying.",3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFJE7Z8,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFJE7Z8
