These were children that my husband and I were previously planning to adopt but at the 11th hour, a judge decreed they would be returned to their birth mother. It has been over two years since they were in our care and we decided to drastically change our lifestyle when they left our home. We sold our house, quit jobs and went adventuring. To receive the news that their mother was arrested sent us in a tailspin. Would they need us to foster them again? Would the chance to adopt them arise? What would we need to immediately change in our life to make it happen? Because whatever it was, we would do it. We spent a week on an emotional roller coaster, waiting for some news about these kids that we still love. As days passed, no news emerged and we settled back into the idea that they wouldn't need us. Then again, a few weeks ago we received reports from friends that Child Services were talking to the kids and that reports had been made regarding their situation. All of a sudden we were on the roller coaster again. Days passed, no news. Maybe this event is still ongoing, maybe it's over.",,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22049PES
