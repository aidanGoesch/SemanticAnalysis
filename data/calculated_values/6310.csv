But 4 months ago was different, something special happened. As I was walking by an enclosure one of the zookeepers was entering through a side door, and waved me over. He asked if I could give him a hand for a moment in the giraffe enclosure. I said yes immediately because giraffes are my favorite animal. He explained that he just needed me to distract the giraffes for a few minutes so he could fix something. He said the giraffes were friendly and it would be easy. So while he was over by the wall fiddling with something, I got to stand there with 3 giraffes around me. There was a big basket of leaves that the zookeeper had given me, and I was grabbing handfuls of leaves and feeding them to the giraffes one at a time. After they finished the leaves, I noticed the zookeeper wasn't finished yet and was worried, but the giraffes stayed near me and put their heads down close to me. I realized they wanted me to touch them, so I started to pet them on the head. After a few more minutes the zookeeper had finished, and we both walked towards the door to leave. Just before I stepped through the door I turned and looked back, and one of the giraffes, the one closest to me, put her head down and rested it on my shoulder. I felt like I had a special connection with the giraffe. It was a special day at the zoo.",,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2
