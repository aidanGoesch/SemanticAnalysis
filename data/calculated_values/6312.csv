It was a perfect day and it wasn't too crowded but the best part of all was I fed a giraffe for the first time. Actually I spent about an hour and a day's pay feeding giraffes. I couldn't stop, they were so beautiful. I don't know what it was about them, I don't usually like big animals like that but they were so gentle and friendly. I couldn't believe I was standing there face to face with a giraffe. It let me caress it's fuzzy ear antlers or horns or whatever those little nubbins are. I think the most surprising thing was when I felt a long black tongue, smooth like a dog's but not nearly as wet, as I put a leave up to it's mouth. It was like time stood still and nothing else mattered but me and that giraffe! I had fantastical ideas like saddling it and riding away, and wondered if that was even possible. I looked in it's eyes and I felt like we had some sort of cosmic connection. I don't believe in souls but if there were souls I think that giraffe definitely had one! It's really inspired me to work closer with animals. I know I can't train a giraffe like I train the dogs at work but I'd love to work up close with them one day. I will never, ever forget this day. I hope it changes my future.",3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2
