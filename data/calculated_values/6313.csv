I have been a member of my church for many years.  I have made many friends throughout the years there.  One of my friends told me how awesome it was being a church server.  I was hesitant to pursue being a server because I am someone who is afraid to try new things.   However my friend went with me to the priest and I inquired about it.  I learned about the task of the server which involves attending to tasks at the altar like ringing the bell and carrying items.  I decided to go for it and try something new.  The first time I served at the church was amazing!  I was surprised at how connected I felt to God.  I knew I made the right decision.  My church community has been nothing but supportive and has guided me in my faith.  Being a server has been a great way for me to be even more involved with my church.    I feel like I am doing what I am supposed to be doing in life.  I have never felt so fulfilled in my life before!,,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22R3TEPQ
