I am almost 7 months post break and surgery and every single day is a struggle. I still have swelling and pain. I cannot live my life the way it was before the break. I tire much more easily. My husband has had to pick up a lot of the slack and it is wearing on him, and our relationship. I have been cleared to drive short distances so I can at least do some of the running for the kids practices and games. Depression and anxiety are very real. I can't walk outside when it is wet. I try to go hiking with my husband and have panic attacks. One day, maybe this new normal will be tolerable. My doctor says a year to tolerably normal. Sometimes it seems like it has been no time at all. Others it seems like it has been forever. I hope soon I can resume my normal life.",3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYH7O5HG,
