The day was February 2nd. J and I went for a hike. I decided to check out the back side of the rapids near a waterfall. Unfortunately, I slipped on a wet tree root and broke my leg/ankle/foot. I had to be brought out of the woods by the park rangers, rescue squad and fire department. Later that night, we made it to the ER. I had my leg set and 2 days later an appointment with the orthopedic surgeon. We had to wait 3 days to have surgery. Now 5 months later, here I am. Still gimping. Someday I hope to get back to my normal life. I miss walking like a normal person. It can't come soon enough. One of these days I will be able to do all the fun stuff again.",3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYH7O5HG,3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYH7O5HG
