It has been awhile since we have connected and spent time together. Honestly it maybe past three months already since I saw them and life really does fly past by us and we just don't necessarily notice that. Anyways, Paul, my father in law always cooks this mean and delicious lasagna everytime I come over. He does this because he knows it is my favorite food to eat a lot everytime I come over, now Janet, on the other hand, my mother in law, sets up the games we play for the night. The games usually is a combination of board games and mostly mind games, I remember that night it was a little bit of Jenga for a casual warm up game, and the main game for the night was charades. I don't usually drink but I am pretty sure that night I drank around 3 bottle of beers, I didn't feel drunk at all even though I was driving. I was incredibly happy that night because I remember winning a lot of the charades game. I definitely missed them because we don't usually meet up anymore and spend quality time quite often like before. I ate just a little bit of lasagna though even though it was still consistently good. It is a good thing that I didn't ate a lot because I drank more than I ate. When I was about to leave for the night, I really felt happy and enjoyed the night. I won a lot of games and it's been awhile since I drank alcohol. Nights like that always makes me wonder if only people try to spend quality time with the people close to them, it is not that hard. Hopefully I get to spend some more time with my in laws in the coming months, I truly did miss them a lot.",,3XXU1SWE8NHBJLTNVFWIQXB3N4DA0F
