Where do I start. I am a 43 year old mom of 4 kids, 21, 16, 13, and 6. My husband and I are both veterans. In the past 8-10 years I've become dependent on alcohol. Due to this I have faced many problems at the expense of my family. I am seen by a doctor and do have a job (not sure how I have a job because I miss a lot of work). My kids love me and turn a blind eye because I am a functional alcoholic. I'm starting to feel a bit sad. So here it is, I was pulled over 5 months ago, DUI. Crazy! White, a mom, pretty, has a good job, veteran, all these things. This is something that is my fault completely. I've recently went to court and am so thankful for how things were decided. I did have a lawyer I hired ($3000). I do have a lot of fines and probation. I realize I need help and have been seeing a counselor at the VA since (and before).
