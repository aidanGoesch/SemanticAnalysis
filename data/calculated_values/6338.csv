I hate how needlessly overprotective she is with me. I am a grown man! I couldve processed everything by now, but no,  now I'm I'll be a wreck to to start the year. Anyways, oh god, my best cousin has cancer. What the hell! This cannot be real. I have never had someone I know die! Oh God, I cannot even make this about me. My poor, brilliant cousin dieing would be a tragedy of the upmost regard. At least, knowing Matt, I know he's going to research everything he possibly can about his condition and do anything to live! I shall put some time in my day to contact him about it and see if I can help in any way. I am willing to get fired from work if it means saving my friend or being there for him if the time comes. Nooooo, positive thinking! I will visualize him happy and healthy as much as I can. Please God, not Matt!",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDF2DVQ
