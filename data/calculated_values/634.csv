I was in Times Square, New York.  It was raining really really bad. I was experiencing such a bad day. She cheered me up such big time. I feel that I am very kind and can make great things happen. IT was raining and when the ball drop happened I could definitely see the world falling through different skies. We were standing for 7 hours in a row. I feel that life was just passing by me. We became best friends very soon. We were playing a movie game. We were doing things that was impressing us. We are very glad that we met. We also shared food. I don't think I would ever forget saffron.",,33L7PJKHCHKYG6XZWJ0EEH7DEYST8M
