I can't even recall how many years ago we started talking about it, dreaming about it, and hoping it would happen. One of our biggest wishes and dreams came true, we bought our first home. For a while, and I mean a while, we had no idea what area we would be looking in. All we knew is that we didn't want to buy a home too far from our family so our son could grow up knowing them. We also wanted our parents to witness him grow in person and not over a video chat hundreds or thousands of miles away. The way it all happened was so crazy and unexpected, I didn't really see it coming. We were renting a very old, run down house that was poorly renovated to be a duplex. The walls were thin, there were leaks and holes on the outside allowing all sorts of wildlife into the attic and crawl spaces. The stairs were so narrow that getting furniture in and out had to be done out of the second floor. We had to get out of there and fast. One day I went to get my haircut and I started talking to the hairdresser that I had only seen once before. I was talking about our need to move and that we didn't want to move too far from where we were. Much to my shock she was actually considering short term renting and selling the home she lived in. I pulled into the driveway and fell in love. It was absolutely perfect. A brick home and a large fenced in yard in the perfect location. I felt like I was dreaming and knew we had to have it. I called my husband and told him I had found our dream home and we needed to make an appointment at the bank to lock in a mortgage. A week later we were sitting down with a woman at the bank, going over our finances, credit scores, and what we could offer as a down payment. We almost didn't make the cut, but they actually approved us for the mortgage loan! It was one of the happiest moments of my entire life. We had finally made it. We were now homeowners and everyone was over the moon with joy and anticipation of moving in and getting settled. I can't believe how lucky we are to own this amazing home.",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDJ0VDE
