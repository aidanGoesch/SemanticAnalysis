We spent a good portion of time searching for a home to buy. Eventually we found a condo and put an offer on it. However, there were circumstances that arose which prevented us from buying the condo. So we kept on searching. We again found something and put an offer on it. We went through the process of inspection, paperwork, etc. Finally, we were home owners! It was very exciting and seemed like it was never going to happen. We began moving in and had to learn about caring for the home. This opened a new chapter for us and the start of home ownership. It is a lot to learn and a lot of care. But, it is worth it! We went through some discouraging times before we found the home that was meant for us. It was definitely a good thing that we didn't give up, or we never would have found our new home.",3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDJ0VDE,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDJ0VDE
