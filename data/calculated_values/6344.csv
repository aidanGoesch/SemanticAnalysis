The doctor confirmed that she was due for delivery but we all stayed and waited. I felt bad because my wife has been in pains for long. I could not watch her anymore so I sat on a worn sofa in front of the ward, Jamie her best friend was there as well with  hospital chaplain who is a family friend. Jamie was crying, the chaplain was praying, and I was feeling utterly, nauseatingly helpless. I had never felt such shock, such numbing fear. My vision was blurred, my hearing seemed muffled, and I couldn't comprehend what was happening in the intensive care unit. The doctors aided my wife Katherine with an oxygen to help her out. I was so confused that I was no longer picking anyone's call because I did not want to loose my wife and unborn son. The doctors were really pumping air into wife saying you can do this try harder and I was hearing my wife screaming ral hard and this made me shed tears.  Did I really hear the doctor say ""CT scan"" I was so scared. One of the doctors stepped out and spoke to me telling me that they would have to run an operation for my wife's safe delivery and I quickly told him to do all what he needs to do so my wife can have the safest of delivery. I rushed home so I could get her goodluck charm as she demanded I should get it for her. I drove as fast as I could so I can be back at the hospital soonest. I go home and immediately I was about to leave the house I got a call from Jamie I thought the worst has happened I was sounding very scared, then Jamies said congrats that Kathering just delivered a bouncing baby boy. I felt so complete. I rushed back to the hospital to see my healthy son whom we named Franklin",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZMFUVD9
