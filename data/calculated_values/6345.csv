I rem this day like it was yesterday. The most memorable day of my life was becoming a father. It was on June 23rd of 2019,I got off from work and decided to surprise my wife. I bought her some flowers and a very beautiful dress because i wanted to take her out for dinner. I was so excited to get home and see my wife after a long day at work. At this point my wife was 9 months pregnant and she was almost delivering but we knew she had like one week left before the baby comes. When i got home i found her sleeping on the couch watching a movie,i told her i had a surprise for her en i asked a to go and freshen up cause i wanted to take her out. After the shower she tried the dress on and it looked perfect on her. As we were busy telling each other how good we looked that evening,she said she felt a sharp pain in her tummy,she ignored it,then came the pain again for the second time,she started screaming asking me to help her. that's when i knew it was time for my prince to come out,she looked so beautiful in that dress,honestly i got a little confused by that situation cause i didn't know what to do first. I remembered the scenes in the movies where a man took the car keys first,that's exactly what i did,i helped her down the stairs and we headed to the hospital. As i was driving my heart and mind were racing,i so nervous,we got to the hospital and the doctors took her  to a private ward,the doctor asked me to relax that my wife was gonna be okay,i tried but i couldn't relax at all,i was anxious and nervous at the same time. I had to call my mom and sister to come and be with us at the hospital,my mum was so excited about the news,my heart kept pounding but again i couldn't help the excitement of becoming a father,i was so happy because this was gonna be my first child. After few minutes my mom and sister arrived,then the doctors came out smiling,when i saw the smiles it calm me down and i knew all was well,they told me its a boy and he was normal and healthy,believe me nothing can measure the joy and pride i felt that day,i jumped up and down hugging my mum and sister,i remember i even cried,they were tears of joy. I couldn't wait to hold my little man,my mini me,we were allowed to go in and see my wife and kid,when she saw me she started smiling and she said,""you are a father now,i love you"",i couldn't believe holding a baby that belongs to me for the first time,we had waited for so long before my wife could get pregnant but on 23rd of June 2019 she gave me a son. I will never forget this day even if i get old,this is a very special day to me,the day i became a father. I am so happy to be a father and i thank God for my son.",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZMFUVD9
