Even though he wasnt biologically my father, he still was the only one I'd ever known. Last week he passed away and I was lost. I was a wreck and not sure what to do. He was one of my best friends. I had just gotten coffee with him the day before and he was over eating dinner at our house last weekend. I would see him many times a week and he would always show up to any events the kids had. Explaining to a 5 and 7 year old the concept of death was not easy, especially when we grew up non religious so didnt much believe in god, heaven or life after death. However A few nights after his passing he came to me in a dream. He was just there, telling me to come close. He hugged me and told me to look at him. He told me he would always be there for me and he meant it. He always promised to me that he would be there for me no matter what when i was sad, or hurting. I didnt think it was possible that he would do this for me even after dying. I think it solidified my belief that there is something after death. I passed down this promise to my kids, and hope I can do the same for them. I love my dad and I miss him, but I know he is watching out for me.",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UIUOPIT
