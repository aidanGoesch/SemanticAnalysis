This week, I now believe this more than ever because something extraordinary happened to me. Several months ago I did a DNA test through Ancestry. com and began to receive information about who I might be related to. Most of the relationships were second, third, etc. cousins and one or two first cousins, which I did expect.  However, this week, I receive a new name and it looked somewhat familiar to me. The information provided indicated that this individual lived in the same town as I, so I was really stunned! I sent her a message and told her who I was and where I lived. When she responded with her information it was unbelievable! We both live in the same 55 and over community and our homes are a mile apart. Her name sounded familiar because she is on one of the committees of our Home Owners Association. Now, there is no such thing as a coincidence. When I tell people about this they are shocked. I am glad we made contact because I now have a new family member. We are looking forward to sharing stories of our pasts.",3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJWEPIO,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJWEPIO
