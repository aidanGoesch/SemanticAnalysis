He was here for our first date, a hike in Pogonip between graduate school classes. I was immediately comfortable with my then girlfriend, now wife because of how Billy took to her in those balmy, halcyon days. Billy loves to run off leash. He chases squirrels up redwoods, and seagulls on the beach. We've only ever fed him organic, grass fed beef in the morning, and grain free, organic chicken based kibble at night. He's never been overweight and always been up for anything. Two weeks ago, he suddenly just fell on the ground, unconscious. I totally panicked. I've never experienced anything so shocking or out of the normal flow of events in my adult life. We took him to the animal hospital immediately, where they kept him overnight. We had blood tests and a full evaluation. It's great that we have pet insurance or we would have been out $2,000! Billy is on medication now, and we have to give it to him twice a day every day to help him stabilize. It's so sad to see something you trust to always be here start to decompose and degrade. But I suppose that is the nature of pets, we love them and celebrate them and must pay attention to every moment, as every moment is precious.",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0USX4PIP
