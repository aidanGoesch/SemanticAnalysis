They can't tell you where they hurt, or how they feel, it is kinda like they are little babies. I always forget how little my dog is, I'm always calling him my little man or my little grandpa. He acts like an old man, grunting, huffing, yes my dog with huff at you in disapproval. We had no clue he was sick until one night he just fell out in the floor and released his bladder, unresponsive, weak, stiff as a board, eyes open, looked like he had died. It was very scary not knowing what to do, do you move him? do you leave him alone? does he need CPR? I was so scared and I am a mother of 2 grown sons. He continued to have 2 more of these episodes throughout the night, morning could not get here fast enough. We took our little man to the vet, he was scared and unsure, like always. We found out our babies heart murmur has gotten worse, this is not good. Basically his heart gives out and he passes out. He is now on a heart medication, twice daily. And he actually takes his medication like a good boy. But it worries me, how long will he have? When will he do this again? What if this happens and I'm not home to help him. This is the part of being a Dog Mom that absolutely sucks. My baby is 6yrs old, he was a rescue when he was about 6mths old. This is going to suck, bad.",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0USX4PIP
