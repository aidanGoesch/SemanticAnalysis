The news was just dropped on me as I walked in to work. I got called into a meeting room with my direct supervisor and and another upper management guy and was told I was being let go. I asked why and they gave some vague answer; they said unforeseen circumstances require that they immediately downsize the department. Sounded like a load of B.S. to me. During this, my supervisor wasn't him self and was unusually quiet. The upper management guy did all the talking. Even now with it being months later, I still feel confused and frustrated over this. Our department was making good progress with work and I have always had good performance reviews. The worst thing about all this is that I can't help but speculate all the reasons why I might have been ""let go."" Was I getting too old and they wanted someone younger? Did I inadvertently piss off some important client or someone in upper management? Maybe the CEO's nephew didn't like the look of my face. It doesn't really make sense to me. This is what 20 years of loyalty buys these days. I have reached out to a competitor since, and I am scheduled for an interview tomorrow. My main drive now is to make my old company regret firing me.",,3Y9N9SS8LZX5YKVWYC53IWHGMV3D3N
