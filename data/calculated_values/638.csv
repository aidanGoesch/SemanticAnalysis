Although she is still at home and no longer inpatient, her progress has stalled, largely due to a lack of medication compliance. After experiencing psychotic depression that made her spend 5 weeks in the hospital, she was released on her own accord and went home. We were all optimistic, as she had made considerable progress in the hospital. Unfortunately, once she was home, she decided that she was fine and didn't need to follow the doctor's instructions. She stopped going to therapy and taking medications. Her recovery has reached a plateau and we are all nervous waiting for the next ""break."" The last one was due to intense stress, so we are all walking on eggshells trying to keep stress out of her life. This is difficult because my sibling and I live in a different city than her and my father is in denial that this is a severe situation. I visited home over the holidays and it was hard to see how she is not taking care of herself. My father just pretends that everything is ok. My sibling is helpful in these times but feels at a loss, like myself. We are hopeful that at point she will take her meds again but are not optimistic. Not a day passes that I don't worry. I have found that I have to create distance for myself so I don't worry too much. Due to this I am in regular therapy. It is my hope that the situation improves somehow.",33LK57MYLURCL2L7G9V1HW8VZAUSZ6,
