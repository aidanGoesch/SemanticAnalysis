Mark who happened to be my younger brother was a delivery guy and had to deliver papers to the nearby hospital. that's how it all started. Mark came home that day looking so excited like he had just won a lottery. i was compelled to ask what it was. ""she's the most beautiful girl i have ever met. her lips so soft like i just felt my life packed in a can. her eyes so bright i could see my future reflecting back at me with a smile"". he kept on blabbing that i got tired of his whaling that i had to stop him. 2 months later, Mary missed her period and went to the hospital for checkup. that was how it was discovered that she was pregnant. of cause that night she had sex with Mark wasn't the only encounter. most of the time he went to her place and even at the hospital where Mary worked. they both agreed to keep the pregnancy but there was one issue. they both had no apartment of  their own. I, being the older brother and in control of things had to accept that the baby be kept in the house with us while they both worked harder to pay for an apartment of their own and care for their baby. 6 months later, Mary put to bed and behold, it was a glorious sight unknowing to them that was the beginning of all trouble. i really couldn't stop him as it was a means to more income in the house. soon after, Mary found out about Mark's new found love with his boss at his work place and confronted him. Mark couldn't deny it. Mary was so angry that nothing i said mattered to her. later that month, she filed a case against Mark and with social services, claimed full right of baby kelvin. that was the last time i ever saw my baby nephew.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLEEZ843
