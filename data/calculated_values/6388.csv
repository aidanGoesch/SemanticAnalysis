When it finally loaded I had and email from Disney about my upcoming trip to Disney World. I got really excited because it referenced Galaxies Edge, the new star wars themed land opening up soon. I was already prepared to be waiting in line forever, but little did I know this email was about to change all of that. The email was making me aware that Disney was going to accept reservations for all of the attractions in Galaxies Edge, but that the reservations were already open! I rushed to the closest computer I could find and I called my wife. We both logged on and the webpage kept crashing constantly. I just kept reloading the page and my wife did the same over and over until we finally got put in line. Adrenaline was pumping, and she got the reservation for us to do the droid building, and I got the reservation to go into Olga's Cantina to drink the blue and green milk. I am so excited I can barely contain myself, I am a huge fan of star wars and it defined my childhood. It is also working out amazingly that Galaxies edge opening day is on my 5 year wedding anniversary. My wife doesn't care for star wars as much as I do, but she will enjoy it because I like it so much. It will make my wedding anniversary that much better, and I get to walk around saying ""Babe, I am your husband"" in my best Darth Vader voice. And we will have a wedding anniversary drink of the blue milk, and a droid that we built together. I wish we got into the light saber building but the reservations were full and I did not want to spend 200 dollars not knowing if it would be worth it or not.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL487
