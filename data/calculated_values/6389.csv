It was a great time for everybody. The beginning ceremonies were great. There was a bunch of trumpet players playing a nice song. My brother walked down the aisle first. He had a black suit on and looked great. The future wife walked down the aisle second. She had a white dress and a rose in her hair. She looked beautiful. They kissed and were officially married. The party afterwards was great. I had a lot of beer that night. I think everybody had at least 5 drinks because everybody was smashed. It was a fun time seeing people trying to talk. They all slurred their words.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL84B
