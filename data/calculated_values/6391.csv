At their wedding, I was the best man. As the best man, I was in charge of giving the best man speech. I was also in charge of throwing him a bachelor party. For his bachelor party I took him and a few friends to the city to a restaurant. Afterwards we went to a bar and all got hammered. Finally we ended up staying in a 5 star hotel for the night. His wedding was about 2 weeks after his bachelor party. This event was amazing and memorable and I will probably remember it forever. There were more than 200 people in attendance, and great music, dancing, and all around atmosphere. Most importantly, they was making a commitment that was beautiful to witness, and made me feel a certain way that I had never really understood or felt, and still do not fully get. I think what I felt was some weird love that my brother was now going to be living and moving forward with his life with someone else, and it almost felt like I was losing my brother. When it came time to give the best man speech, I had not actually written one. I basically just winged it and made it up as I went along. Surprisingly, it actually went great and everyone loved the stories that I told from us growing up and how he always looked out for me and that he would make a great husband. He always treated me with care and showed me love as a brother, so I knew that he would take care of his wife. It was an awesome experience to take part in the wedding ceremony and watch my brother move forward to the next part of his life as he begins to start a new family of his own. This day will always stick out in my mind, and I do not think that I will ever forget it.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL84B,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL84B
