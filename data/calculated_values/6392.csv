My boyfriend and I had decided to move to Seattle. He had gotten a new job, and I decided the rainy city would be a good place for me to start my own career . The first week we moved into our small one bedroom apartment everything was great. My boyfriend loved his job, we were finally finished unpacking, and a company called me back about an interview. But reality settled in pretty quickly one day when I realized: I had made this move for the benefit of my boyfriend and not myself. He had friends in Seattle whether or not  it be coworkers at his job, or cool people he meet through work. As for me, I had no friends or family. This was made abundantly clear on crisp fall afternoon. I remember the day clearly. I had spent most of the day hold up in our tiny  apartment preparing for my interview.  My boyfriend had called earlier and the day. He said Kia and Chad, a couple in his department, had invited us out for drinks. I was excited because it was my first night going out in the city with other people besides my boyfriend. So, prepping for my interview was really just away to kill time. To be honest I was not so enthusiastic  about the company as I once was when we first moved. As the time got closer, I donned my best dress and slipped into my favorite shoes. I was freshening up in the mirror when my boyfriend called to meet him at the location. I arrived to indie bar on the other side of town. The bar was upscale without being obnoxious . I was offered a drink as soon as I sat at the bar. My boyfriend and his friends arrived. We got a table, order a round and some appetizers. They were great people, but most of the time I felt left out the conversation, as they only talked about work, or insides office jokes.My boyfriend was not accommodating or tried to included me in their conversation. Eventually, we decided to go to a night club. We all hoped into an UBER, since we would be drinking for the night and didn't want to take the risk of driving. The nightclub was fun, but later into the night I lost my boyfriend and didn't see his friends either As almost two hours went buy, I realized my boyfriend left me alone in a crowded nightclub by myself, with no way home, and no friends in the area.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLNHG84Z
