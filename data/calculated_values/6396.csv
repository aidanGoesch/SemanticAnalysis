There is this industrial machine that I have been longing to have for a while now. I have tried to save up for the machine but those money saved were used for some other unforeseen situation that arose. Sometimes last month, I received a call from my husband that traveled for his work that he was coming home. I stood up from my work immediately to prepare some stuffs for his arrival. when husband came back, I was so surprised to see the machine that I have been longing to have. I was so happy, I started leaping for Joy. I hugged him so tight. The next day, I tested the machine. The machine worked  so well and made me be more happy. There is a significance difference between my old machine and my new machine. My clients are even happy because the outcome of the dresses I made for them were topnotch. I started receiving more clients introduced by my old clients. The kind gesture given to me by my husband really promoted my brand very much. The day was a very memorable day for me and I would live my life to remember that day. I love my husband.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLYYK488
