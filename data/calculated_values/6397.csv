That is incredibly cool! I am very happy that I was able to see my stepsibling there -- I haven't seen them in a very long time... I feel that I should reconnect with that side of the family more. I just haven't had the time! I feel that I am not able to spend time with my family as much as I would like these days. Work and kids have gotten most of my time, and my wife needs my attention as well of course. I feel that I am trying my best as a father and going to the gym will help me and my family out. I feel much more calm and relaxed after working out at the gym and my wife is pleased with my appearance. I want to please my wife as much as possible, she deserves a man who will put in effort to look good for her. I am excited to continue to be a better man, going to the gym is what will help me be a better man! To be a better man, I need to visit my family more and pay more attention to them. My stepsibling helped remind me of that. I do not understand why society is set up the way it is, in that we are not able to spend more time with the family and children. Isn't that what life is all about after all? I hope things will change in the near future, or else society is going to lose touch with what it means to have a family and be a family member. Remember, you are a son and a husband.-Until next time diary.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8D8FF14K
