My mother had fallen. I flew back home to meet her. She had gotten a stroke. She was sent to hospice care. It was a painful day that day. She died in the room. I had a big cry and needed to punch a wall to get the anger out of me. I remembered the good times with my mom. I remembered my first day of school. She gave me a big lunch to eat that day. I remembered my graduation from college. She gave me the same lunch as a gag and a cruise. I remember her always cooking good food. I loved the cooking and I will never enjoy that again. I hope she is resting well now.",,30H4UDGLT34F936W931DEP7BXM6MP4
