My uncle Tommy, and my great grandfather abraham. This is what sparked my interest in studying the virus and eventually reading a book about it. I wanted to know the details of the disease. How it affected the immune system and cells of the body. I wanted to know how they thought about about and how they created the vaccine. After reading the book it made me realize how important hpv vaccine really is. My mother was extremely upset when my uncle passed away when she was just a child and when she found out there was a vaccine for it recently it motivated her to get vaccinated as well. I dont know much information about my great grandfather but knew how he died. I told my mom to read the book and my brother. My brother didnt listen and didnt seem to care when I brought it up. My mom skimmed through the book. I didnt have to convince her to get the vaccine because she already knew how important it was. I will continue to get vaccinated hwenever I am due. I will also get other important vaccines because there is some deadly diseases flying around and it is good to be safe than sorry.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DKTE41Q
