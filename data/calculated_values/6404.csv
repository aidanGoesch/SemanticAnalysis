She had cervical cancer in her 30's and a part of her tumor was taken to see if the cells could be kept alive in culture. It resulted that her cells not only stayed alive, they thrived and reproduced very easily. Her cells are now considered immortal. However, what really touched me emotionally and what was most memorable was reading about how she got cervical cancer. She got cervical cancer due to being exposed to different strains of HPV by her husband numerous times, a fact which was only discovered decades later. Due to that finding, a vaccine was formulated to reduce the risk of cervical cancer in women. Reading that immediately prompted me to read more about the HPV vaccine and it's dosage requirements and effectiveness. I remembered that I had only had one dosage so far. As such, reading about this woman who died as a result of being infected by her husband really made me angry at the fact that there was no way for her to have known this could have happened to her. To me, reading about this woman's life validated the need for me to get my second and third dose of the vaccine although I had gotten the first dose more than 2 years ago. She suffered immensely in the last few months of her life and her family also suffered her loss due to something that in this day and age is preventable. Reading about her story opened my eyes about not just cancer, but HPV and the importance of being vaccinated against it. Due to this book I sought out extra medical information that further educated me about the matter and motivated me to contact my health care provider. It also prompted me to have a conversation with my siblings about it. I know that it is in my hands and that I have the resources to continue my HPV immunizations and after reading this book it seems foolish for me not to.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DKTE41Q
