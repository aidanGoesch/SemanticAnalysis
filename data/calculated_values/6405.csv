I did not think I was ever going to be married. I really thought I was going to die alone. I know that sounds dark, but I mean I did not think I was ever going to find anyone because I had no luck whatsoever dating. But in the end, I was wrong about that, and I am glad. I met her in the most random place, which was some random brewery. I did not even see her at first and she came up to me and asked about beer.  I love talking about beer and that is something I can talk about for a long time. That conversation led into just a normal conversation about each other and it went from there. It was nice to be able to slowly go through a relationship and see it progress. It was something I was not used to at all. It was really a learning experience, but a good one. It was the process of getting to know someone and realizing you love each other. Its pretty sweet looking back on it, and its something that I think is more than okay looking back on. I just think that it was something I was not expecting, but would tell anyone to never pass up if you have the chance.  Love is always worth it is what I am saying.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DKXB14S
