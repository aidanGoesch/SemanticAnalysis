I had never been there.  Maine had gorgeous scenery, and the weather was perfect.   I truly was surprised and taken back because no one ever talks about traveling to Maine or Maine being on their bucket list.   I spent my mornings and afternoons working on my grant research project.  I really did not mind, though, as it is what I am passionate about.  My project went really well!  I thought I did great.  I bonded with the other student too.  When my project is published, I believe this is really going to help my resume.  I'm super pumped about having this project under my belt.  When I was done for the day, I explored parks and rivers.  I hope that I can always remember the scenes that I came upon.  I ate at several fabulous restaurants.  Their seafood is unbelievable and very fresh.  I captured beautiful sunsets.  I also met some new people that I plan to stay in contact with.  Overall, it was a fabulous trip.  I'm extremely grateful that my university picked me as one of the two students to represent the school for the project.",,3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4FVM4CY
