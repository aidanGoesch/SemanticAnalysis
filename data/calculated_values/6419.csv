I am a Biology/Computer Science Major at a 4-year university. I was chosen from more than 300 students to travel to Maine and participate in a Biology research project. This trip is an all-expense paid trip during the semester and includes a $1000 dollar stipend. I was in disbelief when I was told by my mentor that I had been chosen. This is a very high honor for myself. I had some struggles at the beginning of my college education. I have worked extremely hard to get my grades and my attitude back to the top. The most important part of this event is the fact that the outcome of the experiment will be published. This is something that is of the utmost importance to anyone who writes. Being a published author/scientist is very important when I am applying for graduate school. This honor that I was chosen for will be at the end of this month. I am so very excited to travel to Maine as I have never traveled further north than North Carolina. I have just completed a written assignment that I will present to the audience on the first day of the project. The Biology chair at my university only had to make one correction to my 12 page paper. He stated I was the first student that received this honor where the paper didn't have to be re-written. This opportunity gives me the much-needed push to forge ahead with my application to graduate school. With the publication of the experiment on my Curriculum Vitae, I am almost assured an acceptance into graduate school. The $1000 dollar stipend/scholarship is a very welcome bonus as I am a starving student.  This opportunity will allow doors to open for me that would not have opened otherwise. I will be forever thankful to the committee that chose me for this project. I will also stop dwelling on my past mistakes as I have shown that I can overcome many challenges in my life. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for myself. I will be certain to do the very best job when in Maine. I will give 100% of myself to this research. I am excited and looking forward to what I can offer the scientific community when the time comes",3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4FVM4CY,
