I comment this is no place for these animals. and everyone looked at their faces with an expression of affirmation. we all went to the camps for bags and work clothes. when we return we start cleaning that site. Once finished we returned to the camp and began to enjoy the rest of the day. but with the question of who had dirtied the site.",,33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5P8G1TP
