My mentor had great and surprising news for me. I had been chosen from over 300 students to travel to the state of Maine to participate in a research study. The trip will be paid in full by my university. I was one of two students chosen at my university for this research. The choice was determined by GPA, leadership and overall ability to succeed. I am overwhelmed and grateful for this opportunity. My first few years of college were great. The next few were a bit of a mess. I fell into the party scene and neglected my studies to the point of being dropped from a major university. I moved back home and spent the following 12 months getting my life together with the help of my family. I enrolled in a different university and put all of my focus on my studies. I have worked very hard to get my GPA back up and this opportunity  has shown the dedication that I have shown towards making a good life for myself. My mentor is aware of my previous problems with college and he has shown a great deal of respect for me considering my previous problems in college. This opportunity is one that I never thought I would have, so I am extremely exited and grateful. The most positive outcome of this is the fact that the research that I will be conducting will be published in an academic journal. This means that I will have published work before graduating with my Bachelor's degree. This will be a very positive asset to have when I apply for graduate school. I am so excited for October 6th to get here as that is when we leave for Maine.",3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4FVM4CY,3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4FVM4CY
