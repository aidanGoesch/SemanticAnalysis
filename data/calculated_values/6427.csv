He was rather distant and not like others at all.  The project, a presentation was due and he never contacted me. I just unsure and nervous about the presentation, and even more so since he did not contact me. He felt that I should have known that he would do his part. That for me to question that was silly. Not sure why he felt that way since I did not know him or his work ethics. Anyway everything worked out in the end and all was good with the presentation, it worked but made me uncomfortable. The event was okay, and we got an a. The project would have less stressful with proper communication. He probably thought I was normal. I am not but that is not important. The project was stressful without adding stress. I felt it could have worked out better. I am a high functioning autistics, he felt I was normal. I had him fooled.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ6R0LR,
