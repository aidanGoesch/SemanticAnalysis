We had several presentations that needed to be done together as a team. On our first presentation, my lab partner and I discussed which sections we would each cover, splitting the assignment in exactly half. Therefore, deciding how we would divide the presentation was an excellent start, but apparently, he felt that was all we needed to discuss. Consequently, that was the extent of our communication since I did not hear from him until the day of class when we were doing our presentation. I expected constant communication while working on the project. Apparently, he felt that no communication was appropriate. However, I felt nervous and uncomfortable. I arrived at class and handed him my thumb drive with my portion of the presentation. I told him we need to exchange numbers when we work on our other presentations. I explained to him that all weekend I had worried that he did not do his portion of the project since I had no contact or communication with him at all. He replied why wouldn’t I work on my section? I replied I am not familiar with you or your work ethic. Apparently, “my communication approach was using the “Theory X- based on the assumption that employees or people are inherently lazy and avoid work, therefore, supports top-down communication.” Theory X was not an effective communication approach. Therefore, I changed my tactics because it was obvious that I should have adhered to the “Theory Y. The Theory Y assumes people can be ambitious and self-motivated. Therefore, this supports two-way communication where managers act as facilitators.” Apparently, I had to change the way I handled this since he did do his portion of the presentation, and the presentation went smoothly, and there were no significant problems. However, it could have been a disaster and without a way to communicate neither party would perceive a problem until the last minute when it would be too late to change anything. Considering that worry, I sat down and told him how much this total lack of communication bothered me, and asked for his number which his reply was hilarious and infuriating at the same time. For reasons unknown, he would not hand out his phone number. Subsequently, I told him I needed his contact information to keep an open channel of communication for our presentations throughout the year. I reiterated that communication is essential, so he gave me his email address. I told myself, this will work, although a cell phone number would have been the optimal way to communicate.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ6R0LR,3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ6R0LR
