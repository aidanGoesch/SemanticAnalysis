My boss was horrible and rude, and he would steal our tip money. I always felt exhausted from running around constantly. The customers never seemed to be happy, and I never seemed to do anything right. I couldn't stay any longer, so I quit after only two weeks. i felt kind of guilty, but no pay was better than making myself miserable. I'm super glad I listened to myself though. About a week and a half after quitting, I found another job. It was similar to what I was doing before, so I was kind of nervous applying. The boss seemed really cool though, so i thought I would give the job (and her a chance)Boy, was I blown away! It was the complete opposite of my last job. My coworkers were awesome, and my boss even better. The customers seemed genuinely happy to be there. I never would have gotten the job if I hadn't quit the other one, and I've been here for 4 months! It was the best decision I have ever made.",,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFU55APJ4
