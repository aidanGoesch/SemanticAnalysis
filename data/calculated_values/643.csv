Joining me on this trip was my best friend, Dale. We met up in the morning, packed up everything we needed, and set off on our adventure that would surely change our lives. Dale and I were headed to Yellowstone national park, a place we had always wanted to visit. The drive there was long and tedious, but eventually we arrived. We parked, checked in, and got all our stuff ready to set out. We started our journey through one of the many beautiful forests this park has to offer. There were towering trees, lush foilage, and everything was teeming with wildlife; it truly was a site to remember. In awe throughout this forest trail trek, I truly felt at peace and calmed by the beautiful nature, and Dale expressed the same feelings. Eventually we started coming across rolling hills as we got deeper into the forest. A noise started ringing throughout the forest, which sounded as if something was letting out a call. As we got closer, we realized it was some kids and a family having fun up on a hill further on the path. We shouted back to the kids, just playing with them; but their group saw us and told us to come join them along the trail. As we talked for a little, Dale and I discovered this group was headed to the sampe campsite as ours, so our journey continued with new friends. We shared stories about our life, dreams, and our love of nature. Bonding with these new people felt nice, especially in such a magical place. As the end of the day approached, we finally arrived at our campsite and set up or camp, as did our new friends. Dale and I started a fire after everything was ready, cooked some food, and played some music just taking in the day and preparing ourselves for the awesome week ahead of us in this great place.",,33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5P8G1TP
