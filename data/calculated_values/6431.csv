I met with a professor at a medical school! I have been told that who you know if a very valuable thing when it comes to finding a good job when you are done with school. I have been trying to meet as many people as I can. In the five weeks since I met the professor, I have been trying to follow his advice. I am studying hard, meeting other people in the industry, and staying out of trouble. The professor was so nice! He offered to help me in any way he could. I am so glad I got over my fear of meeting new people. I know that to be a doctor, I will have to talk to lots of people I have never seen before. I am starting to get more comfortable with that. I think that meeting with this professor will greatly help my chances of getting into medical school! I will be able to use the professor as a reference. If I follow his advice I know that I will be successful. I am very motivated by our talks! I will continue to work hard. I know I can do this! I know I can get into medical school!",,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNCIJP2
