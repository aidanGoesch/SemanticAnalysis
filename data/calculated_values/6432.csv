My uncle put me in contact with the professor, and said that he was very influential in the school, and that his mentorship and rotating with him would improve my chances of an acceptance. Early that morning, my uncle gave me his e-mail address, and I wrote him an e-mail expressing my interest in shadowing him and gaining his insight. A few minutes later, he e-mailed me back, and told me to meet him at the school that day. This threw me off guard, as I wasn't expecting even an e-mail from him that day, much less to drive to the medical school and meet with him. I quickly put on a pair of chinos, and a collared shirt (which was wrinkled because I didn't have anything ironed), and drove to the medical school to meet with him. It took me about twenty minutes to get there, and about another 10 to wait in front of the front desk. It was awkward explaining my situation to the receptionist out front, since I was neither a medical student nor a patient, but just a desperate individual trying to get into medical school. His assistant eventually called me in, and he walked me over to a conference room where we went through my application. I initially didn't know what to expect from the conversation, or what he would ask of me. My grades weren't the best, but I had a relatively MCAT score that would make me competitive for most schools. I was shocked by how nice he was, and what length he was going to for a person that he had never met. He told me that I would be competitive for his school, as well as a number of other schools. He told me that I needed to finish the rest of my application ASAP however, which I kind of already knew to begin with. However, hearing it from him gave me a sense of urgency, so I ended up being determined to finish it. This conversation continued for over an hour, as we went through things I could do to improve my application. Overall, I was really impressed how giving he was. I can't say that I've ever encountered someone so willing to help out a total stranger. This confirmed that this school was my top choice, and it was my mission to become accepted there.",3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNCIJP2,
