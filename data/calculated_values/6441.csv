I retired from the military.  I never thought i would do it so early, it was my career you know? you stay at a career until you can no longer do it anymore...at least that was the way i was brought up.  20 years is a long time, but heck i'm barely in my 40s and already retired!  Now what do i do? But i HAD to do it.  that day...that bus...it haunts my dreams.  Could this have been prevented?  I don't know..possibly..probably.  Its funny ow one event changes how you think about things you thought were one way your whole life...then wow.  I cant explain it to anyone, its my personal nightmare.  Get therapy.  what do THOSE guys know? they've never left the cusion of that sweet couch thy sit on while they are judging you.  I'm not talking to them about war and destruction...they wouldn't know destruction.  they think destruction is dropping their precious phone.  whimps.",,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUV9HPJ9
