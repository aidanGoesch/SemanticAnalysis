If I had my way I would continue to serve for another 20 years but I realize I reached a point where I cannot go on. Several months ago I was overseas in a volatile region. We received word that an IED blast had gone off and that myself and the one other medic I was with needed to respond. We were anticipating maybe 1-3 casualties that could either be dead or wounded but what we came across I could never prepare myself for. The IED blast struck a transportation bus that was mostly filled with women and children. My partner and I immediately got out to assess the situation and begin triage but we did not know where to start. There were dozens of children. We could not see where one body ended and the next began due to the amount of torn flesh, blood, debris. Chaos instilled the situation with smoke, the moans and cries of the injured and the screams of pedestrians who rushed to the scene to assist. When you train in the medical field they make treating an amputation easy. You apply a tourniquet, pad the stump, then wait for transportation. I came across patients who had two hands and two feed but the area in-between resembled swiss cheese due to the shredded tissue. How do you wrap this? How do you even begin to stabilize it? At one point in the situation I was giving CPR to a young toddler that was cooked by the flames. I felt their bones break underneath my hands. I felt the flesh stick to my own. Even at this very moment I cannot shake the smell that the burnt flesh reeked of. I have seen and been through a lot in my 20 years in the military but the day I came across a bus filled with children blown up was the day I realized the military was one day too much.",,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUV9HPJ9
