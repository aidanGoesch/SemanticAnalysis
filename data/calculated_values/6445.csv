My mechanic has a small business and is more of a friend than someone I hire just to work on my car.  This means the prices are great but sometimes it takes a lonnnnngg time to get my vehicle's fixed.  I was out of town for 3 weeks and when I returned the Jeep was still being repaired.  Three weeks later it was still being repaired.  This leads me to my memorable event.  I had borrowed my boss's truck on this particular day to run to town.  I had just finished buying groceries and a text message came in. It was from an unknown number and was asking me if I was interested in a car.  I said I was still waiting on my jeep and would definitely love to borrow the car, or even purchase it.  This person, who turned out to be an acquaintance and is now a good friend, told me he was sick of looking at the car and that I could just come take it. I couldn't believe it. I live in Alaska and people are more willing to help one another here than anywhere else I have ever been. It really is a remarkable place but this was absolutely unbelievable.  The car has 300,000 miles on it but its a subaru and runs perfectly. There has been a lot of work done recently and it is perfect for me. The jeep was getting about 12 mpg and now I'm getting well over 20 and that has helped out with money quite a lot too.  This car could have easily been sold for 500 bucks and I'm very grateful.",3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R81SPT4T,3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R81SPT4T
