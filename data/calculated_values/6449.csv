She was told that she would never be able to have children so it was truly a miracle.  It is my niece/nephew so it is very exciting for me. My brother's wife had complications with the pregnancy a month before the due date so they had to induce labor.  It was scary because she was already a high risk pregnancy.  They induced labor and nothing was working correctly. She spent 3 days in the hospital before giving birth.  Me and my mother went to see her and my brother, even though they were exhausted.  I felt so terrible for her because she had to have a balloon inside of her to expand her cervix so she was in extreme pain.  We didn't stay that long because we didn't want to bother her.  The next day they gave birth to a  healthy baby girl with a full head of hair! She is so precious!   I was beyond happy for them and also excited because I can't wait to see her grown and get to know her.  It gives me a way to live vicariously because I don't think that I will ever have any kids of my own.  Even if I do have kids down the line, I'm excited they will have a cousin to look up to.",3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R83I2T4O,
