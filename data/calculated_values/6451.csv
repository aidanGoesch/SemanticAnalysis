I had been waiting all year for this event as I love horses. The horses were amazing and so majestic. A friend of mine is a rider and agreed to take me behind the scenes to see what it takes to get the horses ready to show. Everyone was very friendly and seeing the horses up close was a dream come true. Most of the horses were getting groomed and saddled up for the show. As we were walking out of the barn we were following many of the horses and riders. I was talking to my friend and looking around at all the stalls, not watching where I was walking. Next thing I knew I felt like I was on ice and sliding around. I was trying to stay standing but before I could grab something I slipped and fell down. I was laying flat on my back and to my surprise everyone was laughing. I started to get up and slipped again. I had actually slipped on horse manure and was not lying in it. My backside was completely covered in horse manure. I never thought to bring a change of clothes, my clothers were covered in horse manure and I totally smelled. I politely excused myself and told my friend I would have to go home to shower and change. She had a slight smile on her face and said she understood. I was so embarrassed and couldn't wait to leave. I will have to wait another year to attend this event and I will remember to take a spare set of clothes.",,3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R8T57T4T
