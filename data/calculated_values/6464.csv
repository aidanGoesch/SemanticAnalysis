We are at that age where we want to make memories with each other's families since we have all gotten married and have our own kids.  It's a lot of fun to have vacations together.  We ended up deciding that going to Seaside, FL was the best place for us all.  It wasn't that far to travel for the whole family.  We decided to take the vacation in May since it was it would be less crowded than in the summer months.  We got more and more excited as the days counted down.  When it was finally time to go to FL, the whole family was excited!  The trip to FL was really fun for everyone in my car.  We sang songs and took a few rest stops at landmarks on the way.  When we finally made it to Seaside, we were amazed at the beauty.  It was the perfect spot to have a vacation.  We got our hotel room right on the beach.  There were so many fun activities in the area for kids to do.  We didn't really have to go too far from the hotel.  We spent a lot of time just relaxing, though.  All the kids seem to have a great time, the adults did too!  We are thankful to God that he took us there and brought us back safe.  It was an experience we'll all never forget",,3YOH7BII0ATXOZ3PA3XW544PWMDVKU
