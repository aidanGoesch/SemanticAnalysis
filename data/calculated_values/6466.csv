This took place back in May.  My family and I typically vacation with my sister and her family.  This year was no different.  We rent a big, 15 passenger van and all 10 of us went to Seaside, Florida together.  We left early in the morning and got at our beach house late that evening.  This was such a memorable vacation, yet the most relaxing that we have taken with my sister and her family.  I have always envisioned vacationing with my sister, realizing that the day will come that my niece and nephew will graduate and family vacations such as this will be a thing of the past.  We played at the beach most days (basically there for 5-6 hrs each day) and just relaxed watching our children play in the ocean, build sandcastles and ride innertubes.  We would drive to Destin and Panama City and tour the city, walk on the pier, eat and shop.  The last time we were in Florida, my youngest was 8 months old, so this was fun to see her reaction to the ocean this time around.  Time passes so quickly, both years and on vacation.  The time you spend together is something so valuable that you can't get that back once its gone.  I feel blessed that God made a way for us to take this vacation, as we knew that it was going to be a bit pricey.  I feel like there is nothing in this world that you can buy your children that could even compare to spending those fun moments as a family.  We watched dolphins, sea turtles and sting rays and enjoyed ice cream and slushies on the pier twice.  Seeing those things through the eyes of children is seriously priceless.  A few days before we were to head home, we took family pictures on the beach and it was the best experience ever.  I have those memories to cherish.  My children were perfectly content collecting seashells and different sand dollars.  I hate seeing things such as this come to an end and having to head back to reality.  We all can't wait to go back.",3YOH7BII0ATXOZ3PA3XW544PWMDVKU,3YOH7BII0ATXOZ3PA3XW544PWMDVKU
