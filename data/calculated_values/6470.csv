It is in a state that i lived before. There was this nature that is different thn here in South, where I live now. Flowers , mountains, diffrent trees everything brought me back to my childhood. Was so precious. i enjoy every moment of it. I met at the wedding old friends, I have to meet family, that i did not meet in long time. There was this beautiful bush of roses on the fence of the neighbour, that I was seeing only in my childhood. It was facinating. Looking every morning, till we were there brought me so much joy. I had to spend time with my grandaughter, she was so friendly and so loving. All the time excited to see new things and playing , non stop. It just reminded me how small kids can look at everything like exciting . When we grow, we are not paying attention, we get bored or non appreciative. Wedding was so full of dances, joy and just everyone look at their bes. beautiful dresses. The groom and bride was marvelous, happy, relaxed and just had so much fun. I loved seeing all relatives, that i seen only on social media, but not in person. This event kept me warm for a long time. I often think about it. Ilke memories that are good. Makes me feel loved, happy and appreciative.",3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C63MX3KK,
