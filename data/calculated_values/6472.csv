It was fun and we all had such a great time together. We also learned many new things from each other that we didn't know before. It was just great. At first I hesitated, because I wasn't sure if that's what I wanted but after experiencing it, I just want to experience it over and over again. I didn't want the fun to end when it just started. So we got together. And we did it. Again and again. Soon we were great friends, and everything was just perfect. I'm so glad we tried it out. And my husband is also very glad. It's just so much fun! I love it. It's great.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C63MZK33
