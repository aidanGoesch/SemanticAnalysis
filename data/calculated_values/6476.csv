My girlfriend and I had been dating for about 8 years and decided it was time to take a nice vacation for just the two of us.  After discussing it for a while I found out she had never been to a beach, so we decided to head to Miami.  She was so excited and everything was perfect, however there was another reason I wanted to take this vacation.  I decided that she was the love of my life and it was high time that I went ahead and asked her to marry me. So I found the perfect beach in Miami for us and decided this would be where I popped the question.  After the flight, we checked into our hotels around 5pm and decided to go out to eat before we went to the beach. I got the ring ready, and decided it was about time to make the biggest decision of my life. Dinner was amazing, I had the fried calamari and she ordered the baked salmon.  I saw the gleam in her eyes and debated whether to ask here then and there.  Something in me told me that the beach would be the perfect place, so I decided to wait. After dinner we got changed and headed to the beach, when she saw the sunset her eyes lit up and you could tell that she was amazed at what she saw.  I figured this was the best time, so I grabbed her hand and got down on one Knee.  Her hand pressed quickly over her mouth as I finally got the nerve to ask ""would you marry me"".  Tears ran down her cheek and as she shivered with excitement nodded her head and said ""Yes"".  This was the greatest day of my life and the start to many great adventures.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV
