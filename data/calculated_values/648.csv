As a result i got sick. I filed a report against them. Then they decided to get be the medications. During the process, i was admitted at the hospital for over a week. The medication was suppose to cover my kids and i. But due to the stoppage of the medications, my daughter got sick and i paid huge amount to make her feel better. I am also charging the insurance company to pay back. The insurance company promised to payback. I also wanted to know the reason why the medication stopped. They should also tell me what happened to the organization. I also have to change the insurance company after. I was really pissed at what happened. That was what happened and how it went.
