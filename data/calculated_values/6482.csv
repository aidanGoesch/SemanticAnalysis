He was looking forward to training as a police officer.  It was a rather dull ceremony held at the local sheriff department. The whole family attended the event- both my parents and our last born sister. The sheriff gave a short speech. He encouraged the recruits to focus on serving the community and the nation. The commissioner issued badges to neatly dressed recruits. The whole thing took an hour and a half. We were invited to take photos with him. After the ceremony, I tried to get  a hold of my brother. We had  made plans to go out and have drinks . After calling his phone severally without answer, he texted me to inform that he would not join us. He explained that the training was starting right away. I was a surprised and disappointed. Eventually, we left for home. My brother took a rain check on the drinks.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6VWC3KB
