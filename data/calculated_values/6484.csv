He was being given is his sheriff's badge and officially accepted into the sheriff's department. We had to go to the courthouse area really early and at 7 am we were led into the compound of buildings and into a secured area. The sheriff came and gave a speech before pining a badge on each one of the new sheriff's shirts. I used my phone to film the whole process. I also looked around while they were talking and I saw very interesting photos of sheriffs going back to the 1800's. There were also photos of many sheriffs on the wall of the facility who had died. It was emotional when the sheriff spoke because he talked about how family was the real reason that they did what they do and it was clear that he meant it. The most surprising moment was when they were told that training started right away. I expecting to get to spend the day with my brother since we even had family in town and it happened to me my birthday but he had to stay and we had to leave. The event was still significant to me and I was glad I got to witness it because it's not something I've probably have the opportunity to do again. I also think it was important for me to be there to support him. I think it makes a difference when you have family who support your career choice. I also have considered law enforcement in the past but I've always decided against it. That doesn't mean I don't think that its a job someone has to do and I'm proud someone in my family is capable of filling that tole.,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6VWC3KB,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6VWC3KB
