I was drawing a huge blank! I didn't really have it in me to write a long tale about anything, but I also didn't feel inspired to write a short story. I thought about writing in the fashion of Bukowski, but I recalled how our professor stated to never write like someone else. We were to write how we'd want to be heard. When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming. At the end of the class, we all turned into the professor our work. The next day, I was called to the front to read my story and was used as an example of how to write in the style of someone and not copying them. I was flattered that my work was recognized! It was even more flattering when I knew that  my paper was probably just a disjointing thought process written to paper.",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943671CYU1T
