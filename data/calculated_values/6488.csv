I had spent the 9-10 months reading to her belly, painting the nursery, assembling baby things, researching about breast feeding and cloth diapering, which carseat to buy, etc.  It's crazy getting ready for a baby.  We had not found out the sex beforehand, but we were both hoping for a baby girl, and that's what we got!  My wife got induced at 6 a.m. and didn't have the baby until 12:17 the next a.m.  She was a champ the whole time.  When it came time to push, it was all very exciting and happened so quickly.  I cut the umbilical cord which I was hesitant about, but I am so glad I did it.  When the baby came out and they told us it was a girl, pure joy ran across both of our faces.  She was a big, healthy girl.  Almost 9 pounds!  We fell in love in that instant and fall in love more every day.  It was the happiest day of our lives and it has only gotten better.  10/10 would highly recommend.",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943677II1U2
