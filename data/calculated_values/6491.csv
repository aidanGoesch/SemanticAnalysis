A good friend of mine died of a heroin overdose. I feel for this friend as he tried so hard to quit. He tried going to recovery several times. He lost the battle and died. I felt such greif for him. The morning after his death I woke to more bad news. Another one of my friends died of the same cause. Heroin is a hard thing to get off of but an easy thing to start. I hope that everyone can get better treatment soon. I hope that the government sees this problem. I hope the governement tries to intervene and fix the problem. These are people! These people have families who suffer for drugs. All they need is a little therapy and some love.,,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943678MMU18
