It was the first church function that we hosted at the property.  That day was particularly hot.  It was the hottest day of the year.  The children played games and had water balloon fights.  Adults rested and fellowshipped in the shade.  We had a picnic lunch of BBQ chicken, potato salad, baked beans and watermelon.  Everyone had a wonderful time.  Near the conclusion of the evening, the children were playing kickball in the field and the adults were discussing where to go to watch fireworks.  Suddenly, one mother began to scream, ""Look! A bear!""  When I finally realized what she was yelling about, I looked to see a black bear come our from the tree line in the corner of the field where the children were playing.   The bear stopped and looked at the children.  Adults began to run toward the children to move them from the field.  After about 3 minutes, the bear turned, crossed the corner of the field, and disappeared into the trees on the other side of the property.  Everyone was startled by seeing the bear, but it was an exciting experience.  One girl was thoughtful enough to pull out her phone and video the event.  It definitely made for a memorable end to a great Fourth of July.",3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H94367ABH1UQ,
