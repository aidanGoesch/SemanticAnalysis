I was quite depressed in July and August, after I got the news. Even though I like my current job, I still had a hard time getting out of bed every morning. I dreaded going to work for a while since I thought I was going to be in a new city by then. I cannot believe how certain I was that the job was going to be offered to me. I still don't know what happened there. One reason why I was so depressed was that I lost my confidence. I told to myself, ""If I cannot even get a job after a good interview, how is this going to ever work for me?""Early September, I took a week off and went camping. Oh, how much I needed this vacation. I was out in the mountains, where I did not have any cell phone connection. I spent my days reading my books and just enjoying the nature. I didn't go hiking or kayaking. I simply took my time to relax and recharge. This vacation helped me get over my depression. I came back to my home and to my work with a completely new perspective. I like my job, but my job, or any job I may get in the future, does not define me. The real life that makes me happy is out there in the wilderness. I will keep working to be able to afford living a comfortable life and to continue to enjoy nature and outdoors. I feel much better now.",3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H94367ABOU1Q,
