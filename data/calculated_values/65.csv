She shared things with me that none of my siblings knew. Just typing this makes me cry. Hearing your mother's heart beat stop is something I'll never forget. I still go to call her on the phone at least 3 times a week. I wish my own adult children called me. They think texting is the same as speaking. In my opinion it can't replace hearing the sound of a loved ones voice-the inflection, the expression. Christmas was terrible. Just my husband and me.. Our cairn terrier died recently. New Year's Eve was even worse. My godchild who is a medical fellow who lives about 2 hours from here begged me to come to her house  because her husband, also a fellow, accused her of something she didn't do -so absolutely outrageous and left. So she paid for me to come by Uber. Happy New Year. Her parents were born in India and they don't believe that she wants a divorce and keep telling her what a good guy he is. At one time I thought so too, but now  I think he's a major control freak. . I know their marriage has made her unhappy and know more about this than her parents  do, but the Indian culture is so different She was raised here.. She needs to be her own person.  My mother was very close to her and her husband of 4 years because they were medical residents where my family lives. She counseled both of them many times....also fed them:-) Wherever her spirit is I know she's flipping out about this. Of course he returned to the house after I left the next evening but notg to speak to her or to try to fix this broken marriage, but to mentally abuse her.  Yesterday I was sitting outside in the sun and a hummingbird kept flying back and forth close to my face. This is very unusual. Then it landed on my left shoulder. I think it was my mother. That's a weird thing to think but maybe there's something to this spiritual stuff.",30H4UDGLT34F936W931DEP7BXM6MP4,
