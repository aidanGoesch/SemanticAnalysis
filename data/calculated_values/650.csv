In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress. Hopefully he can ease my mind.",33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5RXA1TZ,33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5RXA1TZ
