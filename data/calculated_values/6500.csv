She suffers from breast cancer. She doesn't have the best life. Her ex husband harasses her from jail. He writes her letters in order to gain her back. About a week ago her ex was released from jail. Right away her ex starts calling her. He also comes to her house to harass her. She asked him nicely to please leave her alone. He gained his way into her home. He tricked her and said he just wants to talk. He punched her right in the face. She fought back as best as she could. Through this altercation though she broke some ribs. She reported her ex to the police and he went right back to jail.,,3YWRV122CTLDGJCOWOQOJDTFMST8U7
