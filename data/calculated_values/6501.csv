She is on Medicaid, which it turns out is very good for breast cancer, so there have been no issues getting treatments and getting them covered. She had to have a single mastectomy (a double was refused by Medicaid), followed by radiation, followed by chemotherapy. She is now in the last round of radiation. She still has a wound in her chest from surgery, and a ton of side effects from chemotherapy and radiation. It turns out the side effects can be pretty rough, or else my aunt is having an especially bad time of it. She has had: loss of hair, ulcers in mouth, loss of toenails, extreme acne on the scalp, general discomfort, tiredness, nausea, and other awful side effects. But the worst one was getting pneumonia. Apparently, you’re more susceptible to getting it during cancer treatments. So overall, she is having a pretty rough time of it, and so are multiple family members who are helping her through this by taking care of her, buying and preparing food, handling household tasks for her, and driving her between appointments. But everything was still proceeding about as well as can be expected, in these circumstances. Until this last weekend. Her ex-husband was released from jail. Their relationship ended so long ago, I didn’t even know he was in jail, or what crime he committed. But upon his release, he went over to her apartment. She, thinking he came in friendship, let her in. And he beat the crap out of her, for no reason anyone knows. The beating was severe enough that on top of everything else she has going on, she is now beat up to the point of having broken ribs. He also stole her phone, and threatened to kill her. The police haven’t found him yet, and we don’t know what to do.",,3YWRV122CTLDGJCOWOQOJDTFMST8U7
