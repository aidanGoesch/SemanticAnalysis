He's a really close coworker of mine and we work together all the time. Me and him went to our mutual friend's birthday party and we had a good time. Later during the party, I found out that for the past 2 years we've been working together, he had a crush on me! It was really nice to hear because I also had a crush on him too. We both always thought neither one of us were interested in one another so we never bothered pursuing each other. It does suck though because he's moving to New York for college in a few weeks so any chances of a relationship is zero to none. We're both not in a place to be in a relationship anyway, much less a long distance one. What was even more surprising was that he actually tried making a move on earlier in our friendship, but I was completely oblivious to it. It was really touching to hear that coming from him though. He's someone I get along with very well and we always have something interesting to talk about with each other. Upon learning this information, we decided to keep each other in touch when he eventually moves away. Maybe something will happen in the nearby future? We both have no clue yet, but it would be really something special. We don't talk as much because we're both insanely busy in school, but we hope to see each other soon for the holidays.",,3YWRV122CTLDGJCOWOQOJDTFXJQU8J
