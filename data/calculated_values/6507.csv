We knew based on the advanced degree of her illness that she had been dealing with it for a long time. Having known her though, and how she has been basically her whole life, and while she this cancer must have been in her life un-diagnosed, we just knew she would beat it. She is Taiwanese, so she was staying in Taiwan while being treated since her Mandarin was a lot better than her English. Also, the treatment was basically free, and they treat many instances of this type of cancer there, non-small cell lung cancer. So it was less than a year since our last visit, as we had visited after getting married. After she visited us for a couple weeks for our wedding, we went to Taiwan to see relatives, and had some traditional Taiwanese wedding celebrations. So when we visited in April of this year, we were expecting to relax. However, this time, she was looking ill. My wife and I have backgrounds in medical, and we noticed her skin looking yellowish, as well as her eyes. She complained of foot problems, but she said it was because she rolled her ankle. We knew something wasn't right as soon as we saw her. As our stay went on, her condition got worse. Her breathing was very labored, and she felt uncomfortable in her side. She didn't have much energy to do anything. Gone were the days when she would be going for long walks every day, waking up early to go to the market, and talking with all of the locals. Now she was in bed the whole time, only moving to go to the bathroom, which she really hated, and to go lay down on the couch. We had to go to the hospital for a visit with her doctor, he said she was jaundiced really badly, and needed to be admitted to the hospital. We asked her to go to the hospital sooner, but she was waiting to see this particular doctor, as he was the best. Now she was stuck in the hospital, and we were visiting her every single day for the rest of the 2 weeks we were staying. We were coordinating with my wife's two brothers to have someone always there with her. Her oldest brother was there earlier, and he left the week before we got there. My wife's Dad was going to be staying there the day we left. We talked about staying longer, but my wife was needed at work as she hadn't set up someone there to fill her time. This was all happening so fast, and we were so very scared, the cancer was worse than we all were willing to accept.",,3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPY59PUCJ
