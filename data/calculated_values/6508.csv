My son stood tall and proud in an Eagle Scout ceremony. The day started out as usual, I said good morning to my son and asked him how excited he was for his big day. He responded exactly like I thought he would, casual, but not wanting to hurt my feelings. Ever since he was young, being an Eagle Scout is something that he’s been interested in. I was an Eagle Scout myself when I was younger but I made sure that I didn’t push the idea onto him; this is something that I wanted him to do through his own free will. We both finished getting ready and headed to the ceremony. We arrived and went our separate ways, him to the scout area so that he could get ready and myself to the bleachers were an abundance of prideful parents sat. Though there was nothing particularly special or different about this ceremony, I just couldn’t help but feel so proud of my son standing on that stage. He’s worked hard for this moment and it’s something that really means something to him. The most memorable part about it to me was when they had each scout walk up to the microphone and explain what being an Eagle Scout means to them personally. A lot of the answers were expected and a little generic, but when he stood on that stage and began to speak, you could tell that he really meant every word of what he was saying. It brought me back to the days of my youth. All of the times I spent with my scout mates, the hard work that we put ourselves through to be the best that we could be; it was almost overwhelming. For that hour long ceremony, I felt like I had gone back in time. Though I would never tell my son this directly due to the fear of embarrassing him, I see a lot of myself in him; and this experience in my life has done nothing but confirm it. After all was said and done, the ceremony proceeded to end. I stepped off of the bleachers and patiently waited. He walked up to me and I gave him the biggest hug I have in a while. He excitedly told me everything that had been going on behind the scenes and I told him how proud I was of him and how glad I was that he’s found something that truly makes him happen at this early stage in his life. We left the ceremony area and headed back to the car so that we could go home. I’d like to believe that I’ve been doing my best as a father but no one is perfect. My son has grown into a fine young man and though I probably could have done better in some aspects, I am incredibly proud of him. Being an Eagle Scout isn’t something that means much to most, but to us, it’s an honor and a privilege. I love my son and know that he will continue to become the man that he’s destined to be.",,3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYE8DCUW
