Everyone was getting along and in good spirits.  Then things went wrong for me.  Both Dianne and Wilma (my sister-in-laws) gleefully (rightly so) announced they were having more children.  It is their 3rd and 5th child respectively.       I am, myself, unable to have children.  Since this revelation, I thought I had come to terms with this, but apparently not, as I found myself having to excuse myself as I became overwhelmed with sadness.  I was more surprised by my reaction to the news, than to the actual news.     Since this time, I've reflected on the event, and my reaction to it.  I've tried to take what manifested as a painful experience for me, and turn it into a positive.  I've come to the conclusion that I don't want to have children, so there's no reason to let this news have this effect on me.  Further, under more rational thought, having calmed down, I know that due to advances in science, there are other, non-traditional means for me to have children should I change my mind.  I could also always look into adoption.  The best thing to come out of this introspection, is the reminder that this is a joyous event.  I will soon have two new nieces or nephews that I can spoil, and then send home.     I need to do less reacting, and instead acknowledge what I'm feeling, without letting those feelings overwhelm me.",,3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYN2TCU9
