I've always been a Christian, but sometimes I lapse and am not the best one that I could be. I always try to do the best I can. However, a few months ago I went to the doctor and I got the news that I might have something wrong with me. I won't get into that because it's another topic. However, the weeks leading up to that appointment I did a lot of praying. I pray about my life and bargained. I asked God if He let nothing be wrong with me, I'd be a better person. I know you aren't supposed to do things like that, but I did. I felt that was all I had. Which I know now, that isn't true at all. When I went back to the appointment, it turns out the test came back negative. I had nothing wrong with me! I was so relieve that I prayed and thanked God all the way home! I was blessed with a second chance and I am not taking that for granted! I have finally found peace with my life and with my religion!",,3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF3MZQ3Y
