That is when my life is we committed to Christ. I grew up in the church, doing every Sunday and Wednesday and a big part for Sunday School. However, As an adult woman with two children I was trying to do all this on my own power. Where Christ was just a part of my life not my whole life. I am truly living in the peace that Christ promised me. We Are All Made In Christ Image, and when I finally realized that my purpose in life is to grow with him in him then everything else just falls to the Wayside. I think Lord everyday for coming in and changing my life as a young mom so that I can have more Grace, peace, patience,kindness,self-control,love. I didn't realize that I was truly living in the dark for so long. When my life changed, nine months ago. It was almost like a slap in the face that how I was living my life wasn't healthy for my marriage, my children, my family. I was using alcohol to drown out a lot of my problems. And running to a substance cause nothing but a hangover and dehydration. But now I can truly do this all through Christ strength and power. He will never leave us, nor forsake us. I am learning the promises of God daily, growing in them and knowing that every day is a new day to learn something new about myself as well. It is simple, really. We are called to be the salt and light of this world.",3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF3MZQ3Y,
