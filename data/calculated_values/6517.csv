I was walking my dog and stopped to talk to a friend of mine about mundane things.  After talking for a little bit, we both noticed a small furry animal walking up the walk towards us, stopping now and then as if it was lost and looking for home.  My friend called out to it with a series of ""clucks"" and clicking noises, and it immediately ran to us.  It showed absolutely no fear of my dog as it approached, and went directly to my friend.  He picked it up and it nestled into his arms, clearly enjoying the attention.  He then transferred over to me and nestled into my beard, licking it and playing gently with it.  It was a very young ferret, apparently lost or abandoned, and needed a place indoors.  Since he and my dog got along well, I volunteered to take him in until we found out where he belonged.  I searched online and newspaper lost and found resources, but there was no mention of any owners looking for him.  I recalled seeing a small cage in the dumpster earlier on the day we found him, and had my suspicions that he had been abandoned, but checked with our apartment manager just to make sure.  It turned out that the day prior, a family that had owned a ferret had moved out, also abandoning their dog inside the apartment.  I couldn't believe that someone would commit such an act, and promised my new little friend that he would have his forever home with me.  The abandoned dog had already been picked up by animal control, and I later found out it was adopted out too.  This little ferret is now bonded with me and my family and we couldn't imagine life without the little terror.  Always into whatever is left out, but never misses a chance to make me laugh, or at least smile.  All-in-all this was one of the best days in my recent history, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF5AQ3QG,
