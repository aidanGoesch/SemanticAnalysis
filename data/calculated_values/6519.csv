It was eventful and saw lots of friends. Family too. It was a bigger party then I thought. Full of friends, and even more family. It was unexpected for the most part. I didn't know so much family was going to join. But they did and we had lots of fun. I had a blast introducing my friends to my family. I hadn't seen so many people get together so well. We ended up talking late into the night, way past the dinner time. And the cake they had was fun and huge. I had trouble blowing out the candle. So my many friends helped me out with it. And so many presents. I had a wonderful time.",,3Z4AIRP3C7ZNMNMY28SWOA5B1171X4
