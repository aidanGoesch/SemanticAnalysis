On my birthday itself it was a pretty quite day, but I got to do stuff I wanted to do. I don't make a big deal out of my birthday, but I try to at least do what I want to, even if it's small. So that day I went live on my stream and hung out with friends and played video games all day. I started off playing a single player game. After that, me and my friends played multiplayer games for hours and I ended by playing another game. It was just a chill day where I got to hang out with friends and have a good time. The next day my mom came over and brought me a cake and some ice cream for a late little birthday party! We had a red velvet cake and peanut butter cup ice cream. We also watched a movie and I had a great meal I prepared for myself. All in all, those two days were very memorable for me. Not because it was my birthday, but because of what happened on those days that were awesome. I encourage people to do what they want to do whenever, it's your life. don't make huge a  huge deal about your number going up once a year. But if you absolutely must, keep it simple and you'll enjoy it more.",,3Z4AIRP3C7ZNMNMY28SWOA5B1171X4
