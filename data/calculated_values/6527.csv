I have wanted to play here my entire life. When my friend, who is the singer in my band told me our Tom Petty tribute band would be booked to play here I was ecstatic. This was a dream come true for me. Tons of famous bands have played here and the stage and sound are the best of the best. When I first got to the venue, I was greeted by the staff who helped us haul all of our gear. We then sound checked and went upstairs to the green room to eat our dinner which was supplied to us. The green room had drinks, couches and snacks. It was incredible. I felt like I was a professional musician! After we all got dressed up to play, I was a bit nervous because I found out that this venue was almost a sell out show. Once we hit our first note, the light shined on all of us. I saw the joyous crowd and it made me especially happy. We totally rocked everyone's face off. We all took a bow and the fans screamed for us to do an encore. We came back on the stage, and played through one of our finest versions of American Girl. After this was done, we thanked the crowd and shook hand with the many people. When the show was done, I was tired but felt accomplished. It felt like I achieved something in life. This marked a major highlight of my musical career. All of the guys in my band were all proud of each other. When we got packed up, we celebrated the show by going out to eat. It was a good thing that we filmed most of it so that we can all look back on what we did. This is something I can show my future wife and kids what I did in my life.",,3Z4GS9HPNWW7IUV99B57VLJ05MJ77Q
