I have been so down and out since my 'gray' divorce last year.  I began my cross-country journey a few months ago, living out of a camper van, driving across what seems to be an endless stretch of desert. Life alone is not easy, especially for a divorcee starting over in her 'golden years'.  I normally pull over and eat a quick sandwich in the car, but yesterday, I was just too tired to deal with eat, and really craved the presence of other people for a change. I was happy to see a small but run-down diner on the horizon around lunchtime. When I walked into the smoke-filled diner, a young waitress with a pulled-back pony tail greeted me with a jagged-tooth smile and handed me a menu as she walked me to my booth. I noticed a scant number of other diners seated randomly in the restaurant. As I sat and studied the greasy menu, i happened to peer over the top, feeling the gaze of someone on me. I saw a man sitting at the counter, staring straight at me. He was 50-something, with a tousle of salt-and-pepper hair peeking out from the brim of his cowboy hat. He was dressed simply in blue jeans and a starched shirt, wearing a belt with a large silver buckle. He did not break his gaze on me, as he sipped slowly on a cup of coffee. I have never felt such an instant spark of connection. Suddenly, as our eyes met, I knew it. This man was to be my husband.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJ7M18X5
