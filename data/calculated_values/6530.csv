The night before this day was like every other normal night I have had. I woke up to a very loud trumpet sound and heavy drum beats with my girlfriend screaming ""happy birthday"" at the top of her voice. I was in quite a lot of shock as I never saw it coming, she really got me surprised. Just as I got from my bed looking extremely surprised with birthday tunes from the hired Mexican street singers. I was led into the living room by my girlfriend where 80% of my friends were gathered waiting to give me more surprises. As I entered the room I jump in the air and screamed, I have never felt so loved before in my life. Party started soon after, I mingled with my friends and had a chat with my close relatives that also came. We danced, eat a lot of steaks, hot dogs, pizzas and a hot of others with enough bear to go round. II didn't even have a plan for my birthday a day before but was really surprised by how my lady handled everything. fast forward to when everyone already had a lot of fu partying at home. My girlfriend told me she got a ticket for us to see Titanic. We kissed all through the movie and had to leave early when some guys got uncomfortable with our ""PDA"". I can't really explain how I felt that day because it was really magical. I think about it everyday and I hope to do even better for my girlfriend on her birthday this August.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJ7M18X5
