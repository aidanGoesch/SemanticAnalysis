When I saw my brother and sister at the park I was so happy happy to see them. One of them had a baby girl. I was shocked that I missed out on so much. It was one of those thisngs I wished i was there to see you know. I saw how happy he was to have that baby girl he would always tell me he wanted. It's amazing osometimes when you speak something and it comes true. My sister looks amazing. She is working for the UN and she is doing big things over there. She has her career first right now and later kids will come along. I understood exactly what she meant by those words. You dont want to rush anything that important you know. After we spoke we decided to get some drinks later on that night. When the kids are asleep of course. It's something that is nice to see you know.,,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJ8MWX8Q
