The park is near the beach in the city where I live. It was a weekend day so I had plenty of time to relax and walk my dog at the park. I have 2 adopted siblings - a brother and a sister - that live near the park and I just so happened to see my adopted brother. He was skateboarding at the park. I sent a message to our adopted sister and she was able to come to the park to see me and my dog also. My sister had a friend with her. Her friend had spent the night. I sent them to get smoothies for all of us. The smoothie store is near the park. I am not able to see my adopted siblings very much because of family dysfunction, but the day made me very happy. My adopted brother did a special skateboard move just for me and I was able to videotape him on my phone. They were happy to see me. My dog was extremely happy to see them. I was overjoyed to see that they were doing well.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJ8MWX8Q
