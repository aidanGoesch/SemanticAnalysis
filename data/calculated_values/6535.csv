This required me from leaving my current state that I was living in to travel to the state he lived in. It was a 2 day exhausting car ride and by the time I had reached the funeral home, I was tired but still felt emotionally taxed as I saw my grandfather in his casket. What I did not expect to happen for me was that I was overwhelmed with emotions of seeing my grandfather who had now passed away. I was unsure how to take the feeling and felt conflicted with myself as I had rarely talked with him. In all my life, I had only talked with him a dozen times, and mostly these conversations were insignificant. And yet here, I was on the verge of tears. After the funeral was completed and my grandfather was buried, I didn't feel those emotions again. I was unsure whether this was me or how I viewed my grandfather. As the week progressed on, I knew I was all right and that I saw death as a natural process to life. The following week after required me to return home to my home state. The drive home was ever more tiresome as it required me to drive for hours on end, sleep at a hotel and wake up to keep going. By the time I arrived home, I was completely wiped out. I did not want to talk to anyone and I did not want to eat much. This took another week before I was fully myself again.",3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJFGQ8XQ,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJFGQ8XQ
