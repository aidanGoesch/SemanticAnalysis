I started off the day by going to work for a few hours to complete some paperwork that needed to be done for a sale that I just successfully negotiated and put together.  I was at the office form around 8:30 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.  After leaving the office, I went to 7 Springs to enjoy the afternoon with friends and family shooting sporting clays in a fundraiser for Hidden Valley ski patrol.  The weather was absolutely gorgeous, with sunny skies and a very comfortable temperature.  The shoot took about 2 hours to complete and I had a complete blast.  Dinner and the awards ceremony followed the event.  The dinner served was very good, I ate a burger & grilled chicken, plus dessert.  The awards ceremony also was fun and exciting.   My wife was the overall top female shooter for the day and I came inn 2nd overall, unfortunately I missed 1st place by 1 shot.  After my day at 7 Springs, I went home to have some friends over for a fantasy football draft.  I enjoyed a night on the patio with some friends.  We drafted our teams, had a few drinks and good conversations. After the draft, a few friends stayed a little longer to watch the Steelers play preseason football.  The game was exciting and everyone enjoyed the night.  All in all, I had a great birthday.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJGAA8XZ
