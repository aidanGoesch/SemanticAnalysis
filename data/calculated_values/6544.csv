That's when we lost Buddy to liver cancer.  Looking back he hadn't been the same since the end of last year, but I didn't see it at the time.  It started with throwing up more, and losing a bit of weight.  I just assumed it was part of him getting older, nothing more.  Then one day I noticed he was laying down in an awkward position, and wouldn't sleep.  I took him to the vet, and when they called me in to that special room where they give you terrible news, time just stopped.  He had advanced liver cancer, and there was not much hope.  I fell apart right then and there - Buddy was my entire world.  He had seen us through good times and bad, and was our ever constant companion.  I called Josh, and told him to come home through the sobs.  The vet gave us our options that included an aggressive dialysis schedule, or comfort measures.  I couldn't bear the thought of not having Buddy, so we went with the aggressive dialysis schedule.  I took him 3 times a week to the animal hospital, and would sit with him for hours before taking him home.  I held out hope for a few months, but it became apparent that he was still deteriorating.  Josh convinced me that it was time to let Buddy go.  The vet came to our house so Buddy would be kept comfortable.  We stroked his fur and cried together as he finally was at peace.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJI0YX8U
