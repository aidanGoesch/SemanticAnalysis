He was a rescue dog. We found him wandering in the desert, and he started following our car, so we stopped and picked him up. He chose us. He was about a year old, and we had him for over 10 years. He was such a happy dog. He loved to play, to take walks, and my husband was the center of his universe. He came down with cancer, and we did everything we could, but we finally had to let him go. It's been a very sad day saying goodbye. He was such a big part of our lives. We have pets, not kids, and this has been like losing one of our children. The most surprising thing about the day we let him go, was when we got back from the vet and it was so quiet in the house. Writing this has been very painful, since it feels like we lost him just yesterday. I still have dreams about him. I miss him so much. He was a wonderful dog. I'm glad we have cats, because they are a comfort in this time of loss. They sense that I'm sad, and they are constantly by my side.",3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJI0YX8U,
