We've done everything we possibly could, but he hasn't been able to keep any food down, and he can hardly walk. The vet receptionist had to carry him in from the car. Damn cancer, damn it to hell. It is so unfair. This was the happiest dog in the world. All he wanted was to be with my husband-- he's been the center of the dog's universe since the day hubby found him in the desert, starving and half-dead, and brought him home. We've loved him for 11 years, and I would give anything to have him longer, but it was time for us to let him go. The vet knew this could happen any time, so all we had to do was call, and we got in right away. We laid him down on a blanket in the exam room, and my husband and I told him how much we loved him and would miss him. By this time we were all crying, even the vet. It was so hard to say good-bye. We held him as the vet administered the meds, and he was looking at my husband when his eyes closed. It's good that the image he took with him to Rainbow Bridge was his beloved daddy, his everything. I had my hand on his chest and I felt his heart stop. I don't even know how to process this, other than the crushing grief. I'm not a dog owner anymore, after 11 years. No more meds or pain, that's good. He's well and whole again, playing with my dad's dog at Rainbow Bridge as he waits for us. But here, no more walks, no more playing with his rope toy or watching him lie in the back yard with his head up toward the sun. no more checking on him every hour, no more dog to check on us. There was this huge emptiness in the house when we got home. We have four cats, and they will be a comfort to us, but this dog was one in a million. My heart will be broken for a long time - our pets are our kids, and this is such a huge loss. It's so quiet.",3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJI0YX8U,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJI0YX8U
