It had taken a toll on the family. My mother cried for a few hours. My father had to get some drinks. My sisters had a giant cry. My brothers had to drink to forget the pain. I had to drink and cry. I was close to my aunt. I remember going out to eat at a fancy restaurant. I had a big steak to eat. She had a giant salad to eat. We both shared some wine and I had beer. The dessert was very good. It was a cookie sandwich. I hope I can get over the pain of her loss now. I hope she is resting in heaven. She was the life of the party and will be remembered by a lot of people.",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O257CCX1
