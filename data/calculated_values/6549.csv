The last time we went the water park was closed so we only got to ride go carts. I think it was a great choice for a first family trip together. The smiles on my childrens faces made the trip worth every penny. There was a ride that my wife said she would not go on. By the end of the day we rode every single ride, even the one my wife said she would not go on. At first I was thinking about taking the family to Disney world in Orlando, Florida. I am really happy that I chose to go to Daytona beach lagoon. Next year when it is time for another vacation I hope we can return to Daytona beach. We had a problem when we first arrived with the room that we had booked. That problem was quickly taken care of and I had the rest of the weekend to enjoy myself. I used to swim a lot more frequently when I was younger. I guess swimming is something that you never forget how to do. I would recommend Daytona beach lagoon to anybody who is looking for a great place for a family outing. Being that I only live 45 minutes from Daytona beach I will probably find a way to return soon with my family.",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O25XPXCF
