I knew she had been working really hard to improve and I strongly support her with all of it. Her father and I took her to the park to practice. We all know that the only way to get great at skateboarding is to get out there and actually do it. She has some difficult goals but she believes that they will be worth all of the effort and practice once she gets to where she wants to be. I was helping to coach her learning to drop in on a large quarter pipe. Everything looked good but then in just seconds, things did not go as planned. She took a pretty hard fall and it really scared me. It did not take her long to get right back up and get her focus back to where it needed to be. The look on her dad's face went from fear and concern to a genuine look of admiration almost immediately. It turned out to be a great learning experience and we plan to do it again next week. We will most likely be going every week for a while. We live in an area that is warm almost all year. This is a great goal for my daughter for where we live. She knows that we will support her all the way.",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O2637XCA
