We recently went snowboarding in the high country and my daughter got two really good days in on the slopes.  The comparison between skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding is loose, with each having their own intricacies, but the base balance is the same.  We put in extra work at the skate park before we headed up north, and I tried to help her work on balance more than tricks.  Rolling in on the bigger ramps and boxes and trying to speed around the park without taking her feet off the board were key in simulating the snowboard experience.  But the one thing we could not account for was the bindings and/or the fixing of the feet to the board.  This is a very unnatural feeling and hard to simulate or get used to when first on a snowboard, but I think the work we did in the skate park was beneficial. We put her in a lesson to start the trip and she gained confidence from the instructor, who was not her dad, and learned the basics of movement, stopping, and keeping a tow or heel edge.  On our first trip up the lift, she seemed confident but also had some trepidation.  I encouraged her with my early experiences and tales of how long it took me to be able to get down a run without falling.  We both fell getting off the lift and I think that put her at ease a bit, to see me fall and recover to help her exit the landing zone.  Once we were strapped in she had some issue adjusting to the steepness of the run, as it was much steeper than the hill she took the lesson on.  I helped her get her heel plow down and told her it was the easiest way to stop or slow down if she got going too fast.  Initially, the heel side riding is easier because the muscles are stronger and the angle is better to ""dig your heels in"" rather than try to dig your toes in - at first at least.  The first run was very frustrating for her after feeling like she did well in the lessons, but I was so proud of her to want to get back on the lift after some tears, screams, and bumps and bruises.  Again a proud dad moment and it got better through out the two days - way better.  She was right on the edge of getting the feeling of snowboarding in control and I could see her confidence boost after each run.  I'm sure the two days snowboarding will improve her skateboarding and I'm eager to get to the skate park this weekend!",3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O2637XCA,
