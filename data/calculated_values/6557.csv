Recently we have been going to an indoor skatepark where she feels comfortable and has been practicing the two things she wants to accomplish.  She is very close with the ollies and is challenging herself with a rolling or flat practice, instead of on carpet.  We were rotating between the quarter pipes, dropping in and turning, and ollie practice on the flat land last weekend before the park got too crowded.  She was doing well and feeling encourage, telling me she felt good during our water breaks and how close she thought she was on reaching her goals.  On the big drop in, I used a big padded mattress to break her falls and give her some protection as she felt more comfortable with the height and sensation.  After about 10 runs where I moved the pad further and further back and she looked like she had the drop, we decided to run it pad free.  I offered to stand with a hand out in case she needed it and she looked good and confident at the top.  As she dropped, she slapped my hand and made it to the bottom of the ramp and onto the flat, but she was moving pretty fast.  On the flat she lost balance and went down on her back and whacked her helmeted head.  She was stunned and hurt and crying - partially from the pain and some for the shock and embarrassment.   I saw her fall and knew there was no serious injury, so I got her up and walked her to our bench to drink some water and catch her breath.  We took her helmet off and I got her to walk around the park, to walk it off mentally and physically for a few minutes.  When we got back to the bench, she put her helmet back on. I asked her what she was doing - ""going back out there Dad""I cannot put into words how that made me feel, her getting back on the horse without any real encouragement from me.  It was awesome, she is awesome and I am a very proud Dad.",3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O2637XCA,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O2637XCA
