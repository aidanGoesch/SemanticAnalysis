We went up to the house after driving all day through Georgia and Kentucky, and when we arrived most of my grandfather's family was there. His younger brother and two sisters were there with their kids and grandkids. I didn't recognize most of them. But my great uncle looked like my grandad when he was younger, and my great aunts looked like my great grandmother. The house felt so different. It was empty, mostly, all the treasured things gone or taken apart. Upstairs, where I had not been in decades, felt small and cramped, and the floor was bowed. The old maple tree seemed sickly. I felt like the place was sort of dying, and so much of it had faded away. But when I went down to the barn, it was still sturdy, and the honeysuckle and blackberries were fuller than ever. We all walked around and sat and talked, and there was a lot of laughter and people sharing memories. The best thing of all was seeing my grandad with his siblings, and seeing them all in the house they grew up. But the worst thing was knowing this was goodbye in a lot of ways. I think he'll never be with them again, and I know now, after the fact, that the house will be torn down. I think the most memorable event was when my grandaddy and his siblings sat around the kitchen table and talked. One of my cousins had taken wood from the barn and made plaques for all of them that said our family name. They were beautiful, and it would mean they could take a piece of the farm home and keep it always. I am grateful we will always have that in the family.",3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UG3MZ8F,
