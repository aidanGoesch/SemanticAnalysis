My grandfather and his brother and sisters were all there at the house where they grew up. We had a nice supper and everyone sat around and talked about times past. They told stories and shared a lot of great memories and tears too. One of my distant cousins had had plaques made for all the siblings, using old wood from the corn crib with the family name. They shared stories about their brother who had just died, and we met his illegitimate grandchildren whom we had just learned about. That was exciting, and everyone was so welcoming to them. They had inherited a portion of the estate from my great uncle on his death and had come to see the farm for the first and last time. At the sale, a young family with children made the highest bid. We were all happy to see that a new family with kids would be making new memories there. But we were all a bit broken-hearted to say goodbye to it as well. I took a lot of photographs and went to some of my favorite spots, like the creek in the woods, and the hayloft. The most memorable moment was probably sitting outside at dusk and watching the fireflies start to glow like I had so many times as a child. I loved being there with my grandfather and most of his siblings, and one of my uncles, and cousins both near and more distant. And I am happy to know someday I might get to return as they will make the house into a bed and breakfast. But it will all be different then. I love that old farm more than anywhere else on earth.",3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UG3MZ8F,3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UG3MZ8F
