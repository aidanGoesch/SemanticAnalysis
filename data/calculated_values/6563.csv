He didn't used to be much for alcohol, but he is going through a really rough divorce right now, and he is not coping very well. This is my husband's brother, so I am not any closer to his wife than I am to him. I first noticed how much he was drinking when I stopped by the apartment he is renting until the divorce is final. There were beer cans everywhere, and even though it was noon, my relative was still in his pajamas and he looked like hell. I asked him if he was doing okay, and he pretty much told me to get lost. I told my husband how worried I was about his brother when I got home, and suggested he talk to him.  The next thing I know, my husband is telling me he is going to take his brother out with some friends to help get his mind off the divorce and drama. What an idiot! I think his brother has a drinking problem, and my husband is going to take him out to drink. How dumb can you get? I was wrong however. The group wasn't really going out to drink, they were taking my in law to an AA meeting to have an intervention. While they were gone, I went to my brother in law's apartment and got rid of all the alcohol he had there. I hope these will be his first steps to coping with the divorce better and realizing we are all here to support him. Not the alcohol.",,3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UOA88ZW
