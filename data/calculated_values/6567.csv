Without any hesitation, I said yes and started to plan my trip.  I drove from California to Pennsylvania and visited lots of beautiful sites that my friend would have also enjoyed.  I finally made it to Pittsburgh after four days of driving and returned the car back to his family.  I spent a week in the hospital visiting my friend, because on my road trip he ended up having a seizure and had to be admitted.  My friend had looked a lot different from the last time I saw him.  It broke my heart but I knew it would make me stronger.  Every single day I spent at the hospital to be there with his family. In this time, I really grew with his parents who I never really knew before.  I was able to get in contact with lots of friends who had no idea he was in the hospital and they were able to pay him a visit. I felt like I was able to send an army to help his family deal with all of this.  While in Pittsburgh, I was staying with my parents, and I do not get along with my dad well.  But going to the hospital brought me comfort and joy even though it was such a sad time.  When it was finally time to leave to fly back to California, my friend's dad dropped me off at the hospital.  We had a deep conversation and when it was time to step out of the car, I gave him the biggest hug I ever gave someone in my life.  I will always remember that hug.",3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UPXRZ8H,3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UPXRZ8H
