He had been my loyal and faithful companion for 13 years and I had planned to have him by my side for many more years to come. I never realized that losing a dog would be such a hard and traumatizing experience to go through. He was not only my dog, but he was one of the best friends that a person could ask for. I am thankful for the day that he and I shared before he passed. He and I had a wonderful day doing some of his favorite things. We went for a ride around town and then we stopped and had lunch at Burger King. He always knew when we stopped there and would get excited as he saw the cashier at the drive-thru hand the bags to the car. He had a double cheeseburger and ate almost the whole thing. We went home and he was tired from the day so he laid down to rest. That night, we had our normal snuggles and he had his nighttime treats and went to bed. I woke up the next morning and noticed that he was having a hard time breathing. It was early and I planned to contact the vet to see what was going on with him, but unfortunately before I had a chance to call them, he had stopped breathing and that is when I realized he was no longer with us. I felt a wave of nausea and panic set in as I saw he was gone and I didn't have time to say goodbye to him. There is not a day goes by that I don't think of him and wish that he was still here by my side. The events are still as crystal clear in my mind as they were the day it happened. I have had thoughts of getting another puppy to help fill the void, but there is nothing that could ever replace my Jesse.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM9B7Z1L,
