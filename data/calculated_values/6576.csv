I inevitably became the first female to ever be elected to the office that I hold. I was also the youngest. The best part was I was privileged enough to have my father swear me into the office. It was even done in front of my community. This made me the most happy woman. I am elated and I'm very proud of myself. I have several achievements. I have several awards. There is nothing I cannot try to do and aim to succeed. I am a strong powerful woman. I will go further in life. But this was the most memorable and will stand out in my head forever. I realize my jobs ahead of me will be trying. I am ready!,,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMA41Z12
