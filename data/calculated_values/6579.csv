When I got fired I went into a bad depression and I didn't think I would be able to overcome the job loss. It took me a long time to start to feel better and to overcome the anxiety that went with it. I always worked hard for my boss and I went above and beyond my job duties. They felt that I didn't do enough so 5 months ago they decided just to replace me. I just came in one day and they informed me that my services were not needed anymore. I felt lost and also insulted that I would be thrown aside like that without any explanation. I tried to put things out of my mind by drinking and sleeping all day long. I couldn't understand why no one would hire me after this and it took many interviews to find something after they got rid of me. I hate to think back about it now and when I do I get really worried that it will happen again at any time. It has affected me mentally even at my day job now because I think back about the bad experience I had. I try to set it aside but it's always in my mind that I could be fired even if I make a small mistake. It has hampered my progress at times because I am worried about failure now. Not just in my professional life but also in my personal life. I try not to think back but for some reason the details of the event keep coming back to me and making me feel anxious and sweat. Even finding a new job has not made these feelings go away so I wonder if I should get some type of therapy for these issues.,,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMLP31ZN
