I was really depressed and sad. This happend about 6 months ago. I stayed in my room and hardly came out. I hardly ate and drank. It really bothered me bad. I don't like being at the city I'm in. It's where I'm from and the opportunity sucks. I just have up a little bit. My past negative thoughts started popping up. All the bad things that I been through and almost died at the age of 20 in the hospital bed. It really still affects my mind, anxiety and panic attacks. I had to meditate and stay focused. Losing my job at the time really messed me up. I had to be patient for something better.",,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMLP31ZN
