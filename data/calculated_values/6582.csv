We had to put him to sleep right before my daughters high school graduation. We had company coming in to town for graduation.   After the dog passed away we were all so sad and did not have a lot of energy to get the house ready for company.   The dog was my best friend.  He was so sweet and kind and loving.  He followed me everywhere.  He loved to cuddle with me on the couch and put his head on the backs of my knees. It was such a soothing experience being cuddled up like that with him.   When we discovered he was dying we found a puppy from a little girl on craigslist.  She could not take care of the puppy and happily sold him to us.  The puppy was great for the dying dog.   It gave the dog a purpose and something to focus on, training the new guy.   At first the puppy looked at us in shock, as if to say, ""Rules???    I don't do rules!""    He quickly came around when he discovered there were treats to be earned by following the rules.   I am glad we got a puppy as the older dog was dying.   He made life a little more enjoyable after the old dog passed away.   I still miss the old dog. I hope when I get to heaven that he comes running to greet me!",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGGBBHKZ,
