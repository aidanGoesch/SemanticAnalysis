We named him Cosmo after Cosmo in the fairly odd parents cartoon for the kids.  The adults liked the name Cosco because he was kind of goofy like Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld. He ended up becoming my wife's dog as she was home with him most of the time. He loved the kids and loved walking to school with them. He was a great watch dog, he watched over the house and watched the kids from the window when they were old enough to ride bikes to school alone. I remember one day our son fell off his bike and Cosmo ran to me in the office and barked like crazy. I had no idea why he was barking. My son walked in all scratched up and told me he fell off his bike. We had many good years with Cosmo. He loved being with his family and going to the dog park. He loved cuddling on my wife's legs. When he was only 8 years old the vet detected a heart murmur. The murmur progressed to heart failure. My wife was very depressed and so was Cosmo. We got a puppy to cheer everyone up and it worked for about 9 months. It gave Cosmo a job to do and got him out of his depression.  Sadly, he had a stroke and could no longer stand up. We had a vet come to our house to put him to sleep. It was one of the saddest days of our lives.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGGBBHKZ,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGGBBHKZ
