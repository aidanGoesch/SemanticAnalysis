This was a very heavy storm because normally the amount of water that leaks down onto the table is minuscule. This was the most amount of water I've ever seen and it just so happened this the night I left my laptop sitting underneath. I had just begun working in a new office area of my home and the day previous I had set my laptop next me under the chimney. If I had at least closed the lid I would have not lost use the laptop but it was left open and so the water went directly on the keyboard and into the computer. I did think briefly about moving the laptop but had worked a extra long day and was extremely tired and thus I fell asleep before I could get back up and secure the computer. The rain must have been extremely heavy because it was soaked. I was feeling quite upset with myself for the following week and am still a bit of upset about it . I needed this laptop and will soon be looking for a replacement. It had a back-lit keyboard and this is a feature that for some strange reason is not more common. I will soon begin looking on ebay for certified re-sellers that have a similar laptop for sale. Hopefully I can find a good one for around $100. This is usually how I buy the computers I use as its a good way to get a good computer from a reputable seller. I will probably see if I can find one cheap on auction from someone just wanting to sell their computer but most likely I will buy from a certified refurbisher. There is a list of certified refurbishers and I will start my search with this list as soon as I locate it again. My hope is to make the best of my loss and buy a good laptop that is better than the one I lost.,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGMGFHKJ,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGMGFHKJ
