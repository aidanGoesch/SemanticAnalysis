My niece is already starting kindergarten, I can barely believe it. It feels like I was watching her mother give birth just a few months ago, and now just like that she's in kindergarten! It's wild! I am a bit sad however because due to my work schedule I won't be able to see her very much this fall as she starts up school. Since her mother passed away it has been especially hard for her growing up, and I like to help out any way I can with her growth and development. We have talked numerous times before about how she feels about what happened to her mom, and I like to think I am a significant portion of her life. Previously I was able to drive her to preschool, but my promotion at work has forced me to work stricter hours with less flexibility. I know I will miss our car rides together to and from school. It's tough because I wish there was something I could do to help out more. I know she will make tons of friends at her new school and in her class though, so it might be a decent idea to have her take the bus going forward. Her father and I both are somewhat concerned about her safety on the bus, but I think that's natural when a young child takes a bus on their own for the first time. Growing up and experiencing things on her own is important for her development too! She's a kindergartner after all! I know I'm probably worried for no reason and that she will be just fine in the end, but it's inevitable for me to feel these motherly duties after all we've both been through.",,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO73KHU
