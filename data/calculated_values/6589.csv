I am not able to have kids which makes me sad because I really like kids and always wanted to have a big family. My younger brother is married and has two girls. The one is older and is from his wives previous relationship so I did not know her until she was like four years old.  I love her now though as if I have known her forever and no matter what anyone says she is my niece.  The younger one I have been around since she was born. She has had health issues and I have been there for all of them.  For the last five years I have helped to raise her and take care of her and play with her. I have literally been there for everything. Sometimes I think it gets confusing for her and she even calls me mommy sometimes which is funny but super cute.  Well I knew the time was coming. She is old enough now to go to school which means my days are not going to be filled with craziness and hugs and kisses and playing with a small child.  She started kindergarten.  I am sad of course because now I will not have as much time with her but I am also happy because she loves it and is learning things and making friends.  Just the other day I had to help her with some homework, which I find it crazy that she has, but she was so proud of herself for doing it.  It is a big step for all of us. Hopefully it continues to be a wonderful adventure. I can't wait to see what she does next and hopefully I will be a part of it.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO73KHU,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO73KHU
