We decided to have a sit down dinner and a talent show to honor him. My band director was the best at hosting and organizing talent shows, so we wanted to honor him with a talent show that we organized. We decided to have guest speakers, such as the mayor and other delegates to speak at the event. Several band members volunteered to be on the planning committee to ensure that the event was a success. After nine months of planning, we had obtained the banquet hall, guest speakers, entertainment, and etc. It was very challenging, but we prevailed. During the planning of the event, the committee agreed to have one person to speak on behalf of the group at the end of the event. This individual would ""thank"" everyone for coming and give words of encouragement. I immediately informed the committee that I would not be the spokes person due to my stage fright and nervousness. Another member of the committee volunteered. On the day of the event, everything went well until the ending of the event. The entire committee was called to the stage and I was immediately put on the spot and asked to say a few words to the audience and the honorary. The person who asked me to say a few words is the same person who volunteered to be our spokes person. I immediately froze like a deer in head lights. Not one word would come out my mouth. I felt so embarrassed as I was totally unprepared. After enduring this situation, I have gain more confidence and have over come my stage fright and nervousness. I also make sure to have a speech ready when hosting any event.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO78KHZ,
