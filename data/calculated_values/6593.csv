We were both in a long-distance relationship at the time, and we still are. He came all the way from New York, while I was in Los Angeles, CA. It had been 4 months since we had seen each other, and I was very glad to see him. On the day he was coming, he did not tell me since he wanted it to be a surprise. He did ask me two days before if I was to be free on that day, and I responded in the affirmative. The day he came was on a Saturday, and on that day I was at home with a couple of girlfriends. We were having a movie day since we had had a tiring week at work. When he came to the house, I was pleasantly surprised and very emotional, since it had been such a long time since I had meet him. Luckily I was able to compose myself quickly. While I was composing myself, my boyfriend passionately kissed me while massing my buttocks. He then said loudly I love you very much. That was before he noticed that my friends were around. He then became very embarrassed and started apologizing. That was because my boyfriend is a very shy person. Luckily he was able to compose himself and we had a very great day. My boyfriend left about four days later. When He reached the airport before he left in the plane, I told him I also loved him very much, and that I was glad he came to visit me. I also told him that I didn't respond to him when he said he loved me because I didn't want him to be embarrassed further. He was pretty happy when I told him that.",,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGP9FHK8
