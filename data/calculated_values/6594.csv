He had gotten a nice hotel downtown in the city that I live in. I was staying with him at the hotel while he was visiting. We had just gone out and had drinks and dinner, after a really good day. He wanted to pick up some more drinks and snacks from the store and I decided to go back to the hotel ahead of him. So we decided to part ways at this one intersection and meet back at the hotel. As we were about to go our separate ways, he said that he loved me but then was embarrassed because he said it too soon. It just sort of slipped out for him, he said. I pretend like I didn't hear him and continued on my way back to the hotel. But it was good to know that he was feeling similarly and as deeply about me. In a few days he had to go back home so I went with him to the airport. Right before he got in line for security I told him that I loved him. I said it was not an accident and I meant it. He said he loved me back. Since then we've been saying this to each other and have decided to move in together.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGP9FHK8,
