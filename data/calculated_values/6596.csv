I decided this after almost dying from taking drugs. I was puking from taking too much cocaine. It was a scary trip. I decided to never drink or use drugs as long as I lived. It was tough at first. I had to punch walls to stave off the craving. I decided to go cold turkey. I somehow got over my addiction. I'm glad I stopped taking the drugs and drinking. I feel a lot better now. I got a better job because of it. I look better as well. My family is so proud of me. I will visit them soon. I will talk to them all about my ordeals in my life.",,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX20XU0X
