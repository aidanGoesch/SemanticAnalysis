At the end of last academic year, I realized that I have been drinking way too much and my life was out of control and I was neglecting my family as well as my work responsibilities. My work and family had become a nuisance and inconvenience to my drinking and drug using. One particular Friday night, 77 days ago I was out drinking with friends at the local bar and I was ready to completely commit to leaving my family and being a full time drug user. My wife texted to say she was well-aware of my drug using and she was at the point of leaving. In a typical impulsive and poisoned way, I was fine with that. At the bar, a friend and I were chatting while my friend waited on a call to re-supply his drug stash. This re-up was bigger than normal. Upon getting the call, we headed to the spot to adquire the drugs. This was normal protocol. Once obtained, I got my small share and was happy to hang out with him for the rest of the night, while he made the rounds delivering the newly obtained powerful substance. For some reason, I had a terrible stomach ache and requested that he just drop me off at the bar downtown and scoop me up for on the way to the next location as he was going to be moving all around the town. He agreed and I went back to, hurting with a stomach and content that I had my drugs. As the night progressed, I felt better, so I reached out to my friend to check his stats and have him pick me back up. I text and called many times, but did not receive any answers. This was odd, but I was feeling quite good so I did not let it bother me. At that time, another friend invited me to go by his house. Since several hours had past, I thought it would be a good idea to go to another place. As we were driving to my friends house, we saw the flashing blue and white lights of many police cars. As we drew closer, I noticed my other friend's vechicle being placed on the back of a tow truck. Immediately, I knew what happened and felt a pull at the core of my being. I immediately realized that my stomach pain saved me from being implicated in this situation. Upon arriving to my friends house I knew I had to stop using. The next day, I walked in to a NA meeting and today, I have 78 days clean. I escaped being arrested and I am forever grateful.",3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX20XU0X,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX20XU0X
