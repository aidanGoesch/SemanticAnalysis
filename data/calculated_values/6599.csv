I was kind of surprised when I came back to the apartment after spending the weekend with my folks to see that they had moved all their stuff out.  I mean Sally was actually there cleaning up the bathroom.  She looked at me really flustered and angry.  I asked her ""whats up"", she huffs on how I'm such a procrastinator and she's doing all the cleaning because Tasha is ghosting her.  I asked Sally, what are you talking about?  Did we get robbed? Where's all your stuff? and then ""Oh, didn't Tasha tell you, that we have to be out of the apartment by Tuesday?""  Honestly, my jaw dropped.  I don't know why it did, its not like Tasha was the best roommate, her communication sucked.  So here it is Sunday night and I'm panicked.  I clearly did not plan on moving and now I have a 24 hour window to find something!  So I went down to the mail room and found some empty boxes, I should at least box my things up, while I send out text messages to see whose got a room available or knows of anything I can rent for the next semester.  I texted my parents to, my dad said it was a blessing in disguise.  Sally did all the cleaning and Tasha was already gone, so I just had a small section to pack up.  My dad is always very calm and reassuring, it helped.  I don't know why I hadn't panicked yet, I mean there was a rumored housing shortage both on and off campus.  Yet, I knew a lot of kids were graduating this year and hopefully someone hadn't given up their space.Phil had graduated last year and was working for a small boutique law firm in outside the city, he rented this super cute artist studio in a idyllic neighborhood.  Well it turns out Phil, had actually spent the summer applying to law firms back on the east coast and this morning he signed a contract with a new firm and started the following week.  Phil was offering me, his studio, his landlord agreed to a small rent increase, but it was a still a screaming deal and I was ecstatic.  I spent the whole day, filling up my small car with boxes, to and from storage.  I only packed what I, myself could carry.  My arms and shoulders hurt, my legs hurt from all the up and down motion.  I was emotionally drained, because i think the adrenaline, finally crashed.",,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX3UHU06
