I can't believe the two of us have to move all this apartment by ourselves and we only have today to do it because it was last minute. It has been an emotional month. Our roomates had the cops and complaints against us and if we didn't move out today we were going to get evicted. Because it's ;ast minute noone can help us move so we got a uhual and are mving everything out of our old apartment into our new one a half hour away! Couches, desks, tvs, beds all the heavy stuff ourself and it is grueling labor. We started at 9am and have only almost finished at 10pm.  There have been so many bumps in the road today that have made me so angry. Originally my roomates were working so we could do all this without them here but ofcourse they never left. I hate them for making this happen to us and it's been so awkward living with them. Then we go to the uhual place and our reservation never went through so we waited an hour to get the uhual! My sister has to work at 4 so we wanted to get alot done before then because i will have to do the rest by myself. I feel so mentally and emotionally drained from all of this. Everything hurts on my body and I just want it over with. I feel strong and accomplished that I did most of this by myself.",,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX3UHU06
