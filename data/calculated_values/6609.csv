Last night, the little ones were at it again.  My stomach feels like it is a boxing arena. I wonder if these two will grow up to be professional wrestlers?   I think we will need to go house shopping soon.  This house is not going to be big enough for us all. My wardrobe is no longer sufficient.  I am going shopping tomorrow. My expanded waist line is making it very difficult to fit my current clothes. I really wish I could reach my own feet.  I have to rely on my husband to tie my shoes and even put on my socks.  Only a few more months and this will be over. I cannot wait to hold my precious babies.  After my shopping trip tomorrow, I have a check up with my doctor.  Will write again tomorrow to let you know how it goes, wish me luck!",,3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DPL2CZU
