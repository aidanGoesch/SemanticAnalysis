I just thought it would be worth paying someone to do it for me so I would have less to worry about.  I've been so busy with work and stuff.  The first month was o.k., he seemed to be doing a decent job and I thought I had made a good decision.  It was nice not to worry about what the neighbors are thinking about my shabby looking yard.  I was billed every other week for the service and always paid my bill as soon as I received the statement. But a week before I even received the third bill, this guy started making comments to me about how I needed to pay him.  I told him I would pay him when I received the bill as always.  Then he got really rude about it!  He acted like I hadn't paid him all summer!  I told him again, FIRMLY, that I will pay my bill when it's due and he needed to leave.  He then proceeded to call me a nasty name that I won't repeat.  WTF?!  Can you believe him?  I am totally cancelling this service.  I hope I can find another one on short notice, though.",,33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NOHLCXRR
