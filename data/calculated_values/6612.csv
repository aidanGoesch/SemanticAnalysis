He passed away four months ago. It was one of the most horrific things I've ever had to deal with. I had been taking care of him for a year prior to his passing. I quit my job and he became my full time job along with parenting my three year old. The day that it happened was sort of unusual. My mom was coming to visit. It was the first time they had been in the same room with me since their divorce. Also, my wife and I were arguing all day. This was probably due to the stress. My mom and I went to the store to pick up a few things and my wife text me. The message said she had called for an ambulance for my dad and I needed to come home immediately. When I pulled into the driveway I saw the EMTs inside my house. This is unusual because he was always able to meet them outside. My dad was nearly unconscious as they wheeled him out on a stretcher. The EMT said I could come in the ambulance. On the way out I slapped my dad's face and he came to long enough for me to tell him I was there and for us to lock eyes. However, I knew it was the end. We had done this at least twice a month for a year. But this time felt different. On the way to the hospital he had a massive heart attack and died for all intents and purposes. They could never get him back at the hospital and I told them to stop chest compressions. It was the worst day of my life.",,3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DPSWCZ2
