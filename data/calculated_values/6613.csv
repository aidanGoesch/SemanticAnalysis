It was the end of my high school days. Graduation was just a few days ago. We were all excited but also sad. We knew that many of our friends that we had grown up with were all going their separate ways. Year after year this comfort my friends and I had knowing that the first day of school would not be lonely because we had each other since grade school. But now in a few months it would all change. We would be going off to college and have to make new friends. Some of us would be left behind in this town. Feeling all of these emotions really pushed us to want to spend one last night together to reminisce and enjoy each others company. We all met up at a local restaurant and ate dinner. We thought about going to the movies but then we wouldn't be able to enjoy each others company. So instead we went to the park by the river and talked about all of our past memories and things that were funny and embarrassed. It was fun and really helped to bring us closure and peace knowing that we would always have each other no matter how far apart we all were. After what seemed like hours, we got icecream and went to my friends house and had a sleep over. Just like when we were kids.",,3ZDAD0O1T2ZOV7Y74RC6UGO6VAJXTC
