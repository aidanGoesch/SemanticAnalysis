We have a special dinner and drinks to celebrate, she gets to meet my partner for the first time, and we spend a few days together hanging out. We talked about all the times we had together growing up. We spent almost every weekend together . After high school we both went to different universities . We called each other almost every day.  She met a wonderful guy at college and they are planning to get married once they both get their degree. Our dinner together meant so much to me . I wanted her to meet my partner, I knew they would love each other. We went to the beach and hung out together for several days. She makes me laugh like we are teens again. My partner loved seeing that side of me. She promised next visit she would bring her fiancee with her. He sounds wonderful from the way she talks about him. Of course she asked me to be her maid of honor. I told her I would love to, that it would be a honor to stand with her. She has left now and I miss her already. I will call her tonight, but its not the same as her being here. Writing this makes me feel sad. I feel a tear streaming down my cheek. Soon my partner and I will visit her and meet this new guy. I cant wait to see her again. We both are so lucky to have each other and a special partner in our lives. I wonder what it would have been like if we had chosen the same university? I often think about that. What a great birthday, I will always remember it.",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H2NSTZ5
