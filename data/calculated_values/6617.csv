I'm coming to see you for your birthday!"" I was shocked and thrilled! We talk and text and email, but we haven't been able to see each other since before she had her son, as she lives several states away now. The day finally came. She was on her way! She texted when she arrived at the airport and then again when she had gathered her things and was on the way. A short while later, I saw the car pull into my driveway and I flew to the door. There she was! Different, but the same. We hugged and maybe we both cried just a little. I got to show her my house that I am very proud to have been able to finally purchase after many years of saving. We got to hang out and just talk, for the first time in forever, face-to-face. She had arranged for us to have a special dinner at a really nice restaurant that we'd had both been wanting to try. My partner was with us too. I think having him there made it even more special, since they're both such important parts of my life. He thought it was so cute to see us together and to finally meet her after all these years. We had an amazing dinner, a few drinks, a lot of laughs, and we got to spend several days together, just hanging out. I'll remember this experience for a long time.",3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H2NSTZ5,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H2NSTZ5
