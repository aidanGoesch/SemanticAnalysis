The move was busy and tiresome, so I didn't get too emotional during any of the moving process. We spent weeks making lists, buying supplies, packing up boxes, and preparing. This move is the one where she may not come back next summer, and she took her furniture in her room and some in our bonus room with her. That means I can't go sit in her room without her here and it look the same. Two rooms upstairs look completely different. As we moved her furniture to the truck and I went back upstairs to see how different it looked, I had to take pictures, and it really hit me then what a difference it was. We were so busy that I didn't have time to get too sad about it though. We made the drive the next day and got everything moved in and spent a lot of time setting things up and decorating. As I saw it come together, it made me feel good about the place she is getting to live in. I was so tired when we left and happy with how it turned out, so I made it through without crying. I was surprised that I didn't even cry when we hugged her bye and left. Over the past few weeks, getting to hear from her about how happy she is at school makes it okay with me that she is not living at home. I have had a couple of times I did get sad and cry after the moving part was over. For the most part, though, I am excited for her and happy that she is enjoying it.",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H3AFZT9
