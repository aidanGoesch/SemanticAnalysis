I had a ""not so great"" feeling about him from the start. He's done an okay job, but he's never consistent with timing. He'll show up anywhere from a week to two weeks a part. No problem though. I can deal with that. He emails an invoice on the last day of every month, which is due within 20 days. I always just pay right away, so there's never been a complaint from his end. Well, he was here at the end of September, but October 13th came around and he still wasn't here. I hadn't paid for October yet simply because I forgot. I had a lot going on, but it's not like it was late. The payment wasn't even due until the 20th. The morning of the 13th, I get this angry email that there will be a late fee for payments made late. So, I immediately grab my invoice to make sure he didn't change the due date on it or something and I missed it. But, nope, it wasn't due till the 20th. So, I shoot him an email saying I had no intention of paying it late, but thanks for the warning, I guess. He ends up sending me four rude emails throughout the day saying that just because the bill says the 20th doesn't mean I have to wait till then to pay it. And, he said he doesn't like to babysit customers and all of kinds of other garbage. I was nice initially, thinking maybe he confused me with someone else. I mean, I've always paid like the day I get the bill. He definitely didn't have me confused. He just kept being rude until I finally sent him back a message telling him basically where he could shove his business and what I thought of him. It really stressed me out. I couldn't even sleep that whole night because he had me so worked up all day over this. I don't think I've ever had such bad customer service.",,33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NOHLCXRR
