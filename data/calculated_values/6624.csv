With my limited budget and the market being so flooded at the time, I was looking for a really long time. I put offers in on 11 different homes. In every case they accepted someone else's (probably higher) offer. It became very discouraging finding a home that I liked, or even some that I loved, that I wanted so badly and couldn't have because they chose a different offer. Then, about 4 months ago I came across this house, it was at the top of my budget and it was old, but it was perfect. It had everything that I needed and wanted. It checked all the boxes. I offered full price, all the money I had. I also wrote a letter to the owner expressing how much this home would mean to me. I truly envisioned myself in the home. They got back to me the next day and told me that they had picked ME over someone else's offer that was 10,000 dollars over asking. I was so touched and honored that they chose me over more money. It really felt like it was meant to be. It has been my favorite moment in my life that has meant something monumental.",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14HD8KZTK
