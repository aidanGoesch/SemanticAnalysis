I guess I thought he would live forever but as of about 4 weeks ago I found out that wasn't true. It was the most heartbreaking day of my life. I was expected to speak at his service and I didn't know what to do because I hadn't stopped crying since I got the phone call that he had unexpectedly passed away. I searched my heart and my brain to find something to say but for the life of me I couldn't stop crying long enough to get anything out onto paper much less anything that I could get up in front of everyone and say. I just decided that I would go with the flow and try to come up with what to say on the spot. That was a disaster. From the minute I walked up to the podium I started crying and could barely get a word out in between sobs. Once I got calmed down a bit I tried to talk about all the good times and memories that I had with my father and I got a few out before I had to take a break. I told about the times when we used to go riding around in his mustang and the time he let me move it in my grandmother's driveway and freaked out because he thought I was gonna hit that big tree. I talked about how much he loved his grandkids and how he would take them fishing and teach them how to work on cars. I talked about how he put off his retirement for years and we all knew it was because he loved his job regardless of how much he claimed to hate it. I knew he would be proud of me for standing up in front of everyone talking like that. He knew I had terrible anxiety but I was glad I was able to control it long enough to talk about him and what he meant to me. When I finally said everything I was able to say I went back to my seat where I collapsed into my mother's arms and cried for the rest of the service.,,3ZOTGHDK5JX0MY70E0KK1Y1R8TQOS2
