Our vacation so far was very relaxing and fun however at one morning I felt very optimistic and I decided I wanted to go out for a morning jog. As I jog in Waikiki Beach I noticed theirs a lot of couples holding hands and enjoying themselves. As I run through the whole beach I started to see many couples jogging together and just having a good time. This became repeatable as I see more couples walk and run around the beach I started to feel lonely. I started to catch my breath and start walking. As I keep walking I started to feel that something is missing. This feeling felt that I was the saddest person in the most iconic beaches in the world. I decided to sit down at the sandy beach. I look over the crystal blue water as the sun rising in the horizon and talk to myself. With the waves crashing, gentle wind blowing, and the world just stopped. I looked over the horizon and asked myself ""I'll find you someday"" knowing that although I feel lonely now I need to keep my chin up that I will eventually find my Significant Other. At the same time I made myself a promise that if I do find my significant other I will make sure to bring them back to Hawaii. Walk to the exact spot where I laid on the sand and tell her the story that I'll find her someday. This promise felt emotional to me cause its been a while since I've dated and I have to step out of my comfort zone to find her but it will be well worth it. When I do find her I'll eventually tell her that I will always love her, and ask her to ""Marry Me"" next to a beautiful sunrise in Hawaii.",,3ZOTGHDK5JX0MY70E0KK1Y1RRNAOST
