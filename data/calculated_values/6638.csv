I still remember having my son in my arms as a little baby. I just wanted him to stay like that. But that's not how life works. That's not how anything works, unfortunately. We can only move forward and hope we raised our kids right. I was very proud of him. He was heading off to college, and when I hugged him goodbye, I held on a little longer. Memories flowed, but they were just that. I wanted him to stay home, but I wanted him to succeed. He is very intelligent. But I remember just walking him to preschool. Where did fourteen years go? Cherish the time you have. It ends before you realize.",,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ2IQHD0
