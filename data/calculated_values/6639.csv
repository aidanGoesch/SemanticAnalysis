My child was leaving me.  My nest was now empty.  He had his stuff all packed into the SUV that his father gave him.  I had gotten him everything I could think of that he would need to be starting out on his own.  I wanted him to have everything.  I was worried if he was prepared for life on his own.  I was worried about him so deeply and was struggling to let go with a smile on my face.  I did not want to burden him with my sadness and worry. I wanted him to be free and happy and strong.  I wanted to hold him in my lap again then I huffed at myself he was now 5 10 and about 180lbs  wouldnt fit on my lap anymore .  But in my minds eye I remember cuddling with him and playing .  I was proud he has done good never gave my one problem growing up.  No drugs  never skipped school no drinking .  I couldnt help but think he had become what he was in spite of me not because of me.  so seeing him leaving that day was such a mixture of feelings.  happy and sad and I was so lost.  I missed my son already.  That part of my life was over and it seemed like just a blink of an eye and he was walking away.",3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ2IQHD0,
