It was a very proud moment in my life but also I was sad because he was no longer a child and was leaving home.  We had steaks for lunch and then I kept adding up to his things to pack.  I had been buying stuff for him for months that he would need to be starting out.  It was a happy yet sad time and very moving as he drove away.  He had promised to call as soon as he got to the dorm.  I figured he would probably forget in all the excitement.  I waited until an hour past the time I thought he would call and I texted him.  He was happy and having a good time with his dorm mates.  There are four of them in the dorm apartment.  He is off to a new beginning and again I am very proud and sad to have an empty nest.  The program will not let me end it yet.  So I have to add three more sentences.  I hope this works. I more than met the character count.,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ2IQHD0,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ2IQHD0
