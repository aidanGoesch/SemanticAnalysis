It wasn't a big surprise to me as he was cross-dressing as a female since I'd known him, but I did not know that he actually saw himself as female.  I was totally okay with it and helped her come up with a new name and everything.  Unfortunately, she decided to come out to her parents against my advice, even though we had talked about waiting until she was further along on hormones and maybe tell them during a joint counseling session, as they are very conservative and against everything LGTB+ related.  They did not take it well and things have been really rocky.  Her mom is passive-aggressive and she decided randomly to unfriend us both from Facebook and not to attend my ballet recital (which she had tickets for) and I was a bit hurt by this as I didn't do anything to them.  I haven't even discussed this issue at all with them and so them just lashing out at me is kind of irrational.  Things have gotten a little better and they are moving out of town so it will help that we don't need to see them at all, maybe just at holidays.  I never had a super close relationship with them but I don't understand how parents can hate their child and not support their child like this.  I grew up with really open-minded parents who did not mind that I was pan-sexual and dated both males and females and I wish her parents were like that.  It's been very hard on her dealing with coming out at work (which actually led to some events that caused her to quit but she now has a new job which is going really well) and I know it's hard for her that her parents won't even try to understand. I don't really want to see them again since they are being really immature.  Oh, and did I mention, her mom made her see a psychiatrist and was actually disappointed when the psychiatrist said that she was perfectly normal and this was really a real thing.  Her mom point-blank said she would rather her child be insane than be transgender.  What a piece of work.",3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ3BOHDL,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ3BOHDL
