About a month ago, I intercepted a message from a strange woman professing her love for my husband. My heart shattered on seeing the message. I was so confused I didn't know how to react. I felt like my world was coming to an end. I was so confused about how to treat the situation. I consulted a close friend seeking advice about what to do. Should I confront my husband? Or should I play along in order to learn more about this strange woman? My friend Sarah advised I confronted my husband to ensure I don't act on assumptions. I acted on the advice and confronted my husband who played down the issue, insisting the strange woman in question was just an admirer. he assured me nothing was ongoing between them and promised he would never cheat on me. But there is a part of me who thought my husband is not being honest. I'm scared right now because I think my marriage is hanging on a balance. I have since sought advice from friends and family about steps I need to take to prevent my marriage from crumbling to the ground. Should I hire a private investigator in a bid to learn more about this strange woman? Or should I trust my husband and allow the issue slip? I've been a confused woman for the past two weeks and all meaningful help to savage my situation is extremely welcomed and appreciated. Thanks.",,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQ4YGDHK
