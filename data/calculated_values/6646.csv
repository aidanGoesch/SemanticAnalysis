I can’t believe it’s been one week since all of the drama with my neighbor went down. I can’t really understand how a women with such a great career and future ahead of her could stoop so low. I doubt she thought the truth would get out. An affair with a fairly new hire at her business, come on! Not to mention the thievery they committed together. They nearly stole millions of dollars from her company. I can’t help but think this man came into the picture before getting hired by her. A heist this big had to have been planned for months. She totally took advantage of her managerial position and intentionally hired this guy to make their plan work. Honestly, how did they figure they wouldn’t get caught?!   Now her children and her husband have to deal with the shame. Their name is all over the paper and the news. How could she compromise their well-being and peace for her own selfish gain...it’s sickening. I’m glad somebody caught on and told on them. The nerve she had to lie right to the police officers face!  I really can’t fathom how her poor family must be feeling.",,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQEYWDHA
