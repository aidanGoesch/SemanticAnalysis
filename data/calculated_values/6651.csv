Life has been a series of tests and can i say revelations but my greatest test came on the 27th of august 2013. Being sexually assaulted ,beaten and left to die while coming back from work was totally devastating. I can still see images of my assaulter and i still relive that experience every night when i go to bed. I am totally grateful for the love my family has bestowed upon me this trying time , without them i would have been wallowing in self loathing and regrets. Sometimes i still ask myself whether i brought this upon me , wasn't i good enough , that thought keeps coming. I was totally comatose and was rushed to the ER by a passersby , so i was told when i gained consciousness. It took me several weeks to fully recuperate and i kept wondering of all the people in the world , why this this happen to me. Several tests were done and luckily for me i was screened negative. I felt i was that was a comfort because i was already contemplating suicide if i was diagnosed with  an incurable disease. Sleeping has become a time of torment for me that i get so scared to close my eyes at night. I knew there was something wrong so i had to see a psychologist where i was diagnosed with PTSD. I was given several medications and some lifestyle changes so i dont go spiral. I had to always move around people and take anti-depressant drugs. The doctor assured me that it would fade away gradually if i stick to my medications and also have lots of rest. Its been 5 years now and thanks to the love and compassion showed to me by my family, the whole incidence looks like a bad dream that never happened. I can finally say my healing process is complete",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2ND0T9E1
