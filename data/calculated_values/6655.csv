It was the happiest day of my life. Before we got married we had been dating for three years. I met my wife through a customer of mine when I was doing work at her moms house in New York. My wife was living down in Florida. Her mom said I have a daughter who is single with three kids and I think she would like you. I said okay tell her about me and give her my number if she was interested. Three years later here we are happily married with four kids. Three kids were from her previous marriage. I remember going to sleep the night before the wedding and how I was so excited. When I woke up that morning I was so nervous because I wanted to make sure everything went according to plan and minimal problems. I also couldn't wait to finally say I do and spend the rest of my life with her. We had all of our family there from different parts of the country. The wedding was so beautiful and so nice. The food and entertainment was amazing. But the best part of it all was now I have a family and a wife.,,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NJ6C9E2
