G, as I like to call him (for Little G), loves it. But three weeks ago as I dropped him off, was absolutely terrifed. He could tell too. He kept tell me, ""It's ok daddy, I will be fine."" I dropped him off in the kindergarten class at 9:00. The teacher let all of us worry wort parents linger for a time. G kept waving to me and smiling. He was having a such a great time. I finally left after about an hour. After I picked him up that day, he told me all about how much fun he had and what a wonderful time he had. The last three weeks have been such a great experience. G loves his class. His teacher and his classmates are wonderful. He always talks of all the things he's learned. He even comes home singing the songs he's learned.",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NLX5E9K
