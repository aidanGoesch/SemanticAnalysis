Leading up to this day, I was so anxious to say the least. Every time I thought about it I would get a giant pit in my stomach. She's been to school before, VPK but that is different. Small class, I walk her in and out and it's only 4 hours a day. She was just 4, likely the youngest of the entire class. How could she possibly keep up with the other children? Her birthday would be the second day of school but still! I was just certain that she would get lost and be so scared. Wondering why we would do this to her. Well, that was all for naught! The first day of school was exciting for G not terrifying. Her teacher Ms. Huffmann is kind and clearly capable of creating an environment for these little people to feel safe. I was so proud of G's bravery and sense of adventure. She made friends, played on the playground and loved lunchtime! She couldn't wait to go back. We're in our third week now and I couldn't be more excited for her. I hope her enthusiasm for school continues throughout all her years. Not likely to happen but I'm hopeful!",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NLX5E9K
