Some days our relationship went well. Then I fell in love with a woman. If she too loves me. The days went well. One day she had doubts on top of our two. Nan told her about our poly relationship. Hate our relationship after she initially allowed it. Then I did not talk to him properly. Tell me about the breakup of the romance after a few days. She doesnâ€™t like our poly relationship. Then I split up with the guy who was having a relationship with poly. I felt very lonely. I met her a few days later and told her what happened. She could not separate from me. So we fell in love and ended our marriage.,,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NMZC9ER
