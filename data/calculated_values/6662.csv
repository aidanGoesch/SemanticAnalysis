She was really wonderful. I feel really comfortable with her and felt like I could be my genuine self. We came from very similar backgrounds in terms of class (i.e., working class) and some other life experiences. We met first on a dating app and talked for along time this past winter, but then I actually ghosted her because I had two family members die in a mass shooting which was so rough, and I couldn't handle my shit. But then, I reached back out to her again in July, and she immediately asked me out on a date. We have been hanging out a lot, but now she is not sure if she wants to keep hanging out. I am poly which means that I have a partner who is heterosexual and male-identified. He is extremely supportive of me dating women and not in the bisexual fetishization way, if that makes any sense? He is not dating anyone else currently, and she does not want to date anyone else either besides me. She told me a few days ago that she is really falling for me, but is not sure if she can be in a relationship with me because it terrifies her that I'm with someone else at the same time. I have a lot of feels about this because I know that I am falling for her too and would love to pursue things more, especially since the relationship is so new, but feels so right and good.  I think the other complicated factor and layer is that I am also struggling with my sexual orientation. I had originally asked my partner to go poly with me because I needed to figure out who I was, and I had not dated that many people in general: guys or girls. I could tell he was really sad when I told him, but he was extremely supportive. On top of that, we were planning a wedding/partnership committment at this time, so we almost called that off. We ended up getting committed (we aren't legally married) in June. Everything has been so confusing, and I am feeling quite a breadth of different emotions. I really want to work things out with my girlfriend, but know that there is so much that she needs to figure out. I honestly feel like I could love her because we connected so amazingly. And, I know that she too is falling for me and that her heart is heavy right now. I also know that I need to respect her process. I tried to reassure her that we could do all the things that partners do, like meet my family and plan trips. She seemed very open to that, but also that she feels really sad and terrified. I really hope that things work out.",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NMZC9ER
