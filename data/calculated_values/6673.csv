We all were kind of waiting for it. She wasn't in the best health and she was getting up there, so it didn't  come as a surprise. I kept in touch but honestly I could have been a lot better about it. I don't live near her so I usually called, but I could have called more often. Its something I definitely regret. Anyways, she died, and I had to go to the funeral. Anyways, I caught a lot of flak from relatives, since I'm not an emotional person and they all are. Pretty much everyone but me was crying, while I was just sitting there. Its not that I wasn't sad or upset, its just that I'm not that type of person. Quick question; the instructions say 15-25 sentences, or 600-3000 characters. My story was 600 and some characters, yet I can't move on. I now have to write additional sentences. Its honestly a poor set up choice. If meet either requirement, I should be able to move on, but I guess not.",3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3VGO049,3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3VGO049
