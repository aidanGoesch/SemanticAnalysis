It's been about 2 months, I guess? When I was there, I admit, I was very irresponsible. I was vulnerable! I wasn't used to the local culture and I was a tourist. Before I knew it, my bag and my laptop were gone without me even noticing for an hour. This was worse than when I lost my laptop at college--I am very bad at keeping my things together, and I am worse at keeping my laptop safe. I contacted the police--no help there. They basically told me ""give up, you aren't going to find it here"". Which, cool, I guess. So i'm angry, stressed out, no laptop to get any work done--nothing to distract me. Then the nicest human being I ever met came up to me and asked me what was wrong. I told them--I'm an idiot, I got my laptop stolen. They were so nice, and told me they'd show me to a place to get a new one so I could at least get SOME work done while I was on this trip. They guided me to a local store and even covered a little bit of the cost for me. I wont forget them, nicest person I've known and one of the most interesting characters I've met.",,3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3WBP041
