It was the sport of chess. I decided to play online to get my skills back in shape. I won a few matches at first. I lost a few later. I finally got good enough to compete in championships. I had a hard time getting to the top but I got to the final round. I faced off against a very smart person. The match lasted a few hours. The moves took minutes to make. I finally beat him and got the trophy. I was very proud of myself for winning this match. I hope I can continue my streak going. I will get better at chess. I hope somebody will give me a greater challenge.",,33OOO72IVI70S9NCDVGJG33WSCACT6
