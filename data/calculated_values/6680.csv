Of all the rape stories happening in the news lately. The men at college seem so psychotic and aggressive. I will be so worried about her. I'm worried if something like that happens she will lie to me about it. I'm so concerned about her going away to college. She was staying with friends in California but still when she got back she still acts different... like something weird happened. But she's not willing to share it with me. I'm so concerned that she will grow up to be an evil woman because of some of her actions. Her visit to Cali really turned her into a bad girl. She seems so much different. I hope that at the end of college she can get a decent job because those student loans to burden onto a husband with his own job are too much for a man to handle. She will probably end up marrying a sugar daddy. A sugar daddy that she meets that will pay off her student loans. I can see it now. It's going to be so embarrassing. I wish I had a son.,,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDN51FS6
