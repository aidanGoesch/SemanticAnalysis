I have been to other countries, but I haven't been to other states really. Pulling out of my driveway and out onto the road was a surreal feeling. Usually I'm in work mode and don't get to enjoy life as I should. So finally looking up to getting some vacation time was pure bliss. Making it to the airport and pulling out my passport was pretty cool too. The whole setup felt like I was in some kind of movie. I was ready to go on some kind of mission where I would reach the ultimate heights of relaxation. Really, I was just happy to get away for a bit. Getting onto the plane and seeing Miami slowly fade away from view was nothing short of amazing. I must admit it was a wondrous day. I touched back down in just under four hours and the weather change was head scratching. It was hot, but with the humidity missing, you could survive if you got under some shade.  The people were totally different as well from back home. While I was used to a smattering of cultures there were really only white people around. Though I must say, I would certainly like to go back.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8,
