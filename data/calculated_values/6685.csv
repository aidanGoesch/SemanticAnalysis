It was a memorable occurrence to me because so many things that changed how I viewed life happened on the flight. To begin with, the two airports were completely different. The airport in my home state featured a mish-mash of people from all cultures and backgrounds. It was noisy, crowded, and full of people looking around and in some sort of rush. Compared to the airport I touched down in North Carolina, the people there were mostly of one race (white), it was sparse, and the airport was quiet. I couldn't believe how different things and people were outside of my home state. On the plane ride itself, seeing the sun rise over and above the clouds made me think that life and the world is a lot bigger than I realized. There is a whole world out there I have never visited with people I've never met or no nothing about. It teaches me that it's not good to limit yourself to one place or get comfy sitting in place your whole life. There is so much opportunity and so many things to explore out there. The land area around North Carolina is full of forests and hills and unlike my home state which is flat and all beaches. It really made me broaden my horizons ans know that there's a lot out there to reach out and grab. If I could take this trip all over again, I would because I believe it was an important part of my growth and development. When I got off the flight and hit the ground in North Carolina, it felt like a quaint place- honestly one I wouldn't mind finding myself living in with the newfound mindset the trip gave me.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8
