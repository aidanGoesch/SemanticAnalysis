Being married so young and so quickly like myself, sometimes you learn things you never got a chance to know, and things you wish just weren't true. I am 26, and my wife is about to turn 23. We were married quite young at 21 and 18, respectively. We both had our expectations going into this, but communication was always a problem from the start. I had the expectation of committing to a partner that would put their best foot forward and do whatever it takes to help us be successful. Unfortunately, she was just looking for someone to take care of her. This became evident pretty quickly when she refused to find work. We were living with her father at the time which was a very uncomfortable situation for the both of us. While I slaved away jumping from dead end job to dead end job, she continued to do nothing to help us. Even bringing up the idea of going job hunting was enough to ensue a shouting match, a crying fit, ecetera. Eventually I just stopped trying. Her sense of entitlement has only gotten work throughout the years, especially as I know have a job where I can (barely) afford to support us in our own home that we rent. She continues to ask for more things whilst consistently showing she has no interest in earning them herself. We bought a car a few months ago under the condition that she would do some work on Mturk to help pay off the bill. So far, however, she has completed about 5 surveys. Last year. When we first opened her account. Learning new things about your partner can be a rewarding experience. But sometimes it feels better when you're guessing what kind of person they truly are.",,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDOZWFSQ
