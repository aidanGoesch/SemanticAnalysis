I was coming home from the store after getting groceries for dinner, when a massive black bear ran in front of my car! I wasn't even in a rural area either, so it totally took me by surprise. That thing really came out of nowhere too, and ran way faster than I imagined a bear could run. This was definitely not a small bear by any means. I had to slam on my breaks at the time so thankfully there was nobody behind me. I could see another car going the same direction that also stopped. When we eventually drove off we both locked eyes and kind of expressed the same level of astonishment to each other as we parted. It was all very surreal, and something I've never experienced before in this area. The bear ended up running into a larger forest on the other side of the road, but I can't imagine we have a large population of bears here despite this incident. The environment isn't too bad but I wonder how much food they would be able to find since most of this city is suburban. My only regret about that day is not having time to get my phone out for a picture. My wife didn't really believe me when I told her the story, and only relented after seeing how serious I was about the whole thing. A picture would have been all the evidence I needed, and also a cool memento to remember the event. I know I will definitely be on the lookout for my new friend next time I'm driving in the same area!",,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDPM3SFL
