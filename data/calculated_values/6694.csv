It was early in the morning, around six-thirty. The roads weren't busy, so I was pretty relaxed as I made the drive home, just taking my time. Anyway, I was getting very close to my house, maybe only half a mile away, when a black bear ran out in front of my car! I had to slam on the brakes so I wouldn't hit it. It gave me quite the scare. I had never seen a bear that close up before, I had only seen them in zoos or in nature documentaries or as taxidermy pieces. I think the bear was hanging around the neighborhood because it was trash day. It must have been rummaging through someone's garbage cans. I don't live in the city, but I also don't live in the country or a wooded area, so to see a bear just roaming around on the road was really quite the surprise. It wasn't the last time I saw the bear, though! I saw it again about two weeks after he ran out in front of my car, literally walking through someone's back yard. I don't know if anyone in the neighborhood has called Animal Control or the local authorities, but I get kind of nervous when I go outside now, knowing that there could still be a bear roaming around the neighborhood. Even though the thought of a bear roaming around makes me nervous, I still really hope no one shoots the bear. If Animal Control shows up, I hope that they can relocate the bear safely to the woods where it belongs.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDPM3SFL,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDPM3SFL
