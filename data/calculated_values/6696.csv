As a mother of two, I was faced with not being able to pick up my toddler, or anything heavier than a gallon of milk for that matter, for a duration of four weeks.  I felt extremely anxious about the situation.  How would I get her in and out of her crib, give her a bath, or even get her in the high chair for meals?  My mother-in-law came to the rescue.  Without hesitation, she drove five hours to stay with me for the first two weeks.  She canceled work appointments and social engagements to help me care for my children.  It was so selfless and generous that I don't think I will ever forget her kindness.  I felt so much pain from the surgery, especially during the first week, that I didn't want to do much of anything.  She stepped right in without ever complaining.  The thing I appreciate most about her coming, was that as I started to heal, she graciously stepped back.  My husband was working nonstop, and I felt like we had such a nice feminine ""dance"" in a way around the house.  She didn't step on my toes and interrupt when I wanted to push myself to start caring for the children again.  I will be forever grateful to her.  I hope that I can repay her one day.",,3ZSY5X72NYXOLJ7NZBKFBOWV5IXRO8
