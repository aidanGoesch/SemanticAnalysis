I've even sought outside help from friends, family and professionals to help her. My daughter's father believed that she would stop ""acting out"" if I would stop reacting. I could stop so we were divorced by the time she turned seven and my husband ended up with custody of our daughter. We all co-existed as peacefully for the next 2 years, I was granted every other weekend visitation rights. Not liking the anti-psychotic medications that he found doctors to prescribe for her I had to admit that her visits with the psychologist did seem to bring a sense of calmness to my child and was hopeful my daughter could at some point go on to lead a normal life until 3 days after her ninth birthday. that morning I showered, I dressed and made some breakfast and started going through what I had planned because it was my weekend with my daughter only to have all my plans come crashing to a halt when my phone rang. It was the police and they told me that my daughter there at the station and asked me to come in immediately. I rushed to the police station to find my daughter sobbing uncontrollably in a room with two officers. After entering the room and embracing my child I took a few moment to explain who I was to the officers and wanted to know what happened. Visibly shaken but otherwise unharmed my daughter seemed to be calming now that I was there but she was in no condition to tell me what happened, so I asked the officers. They hadn't gotten very much from her but stated she had not been picked up from school so she walked home yesterday afternoon to discover she had been locked out. They told me that she somehow thought she was responsible and ashamed of this so decided to try and run away, and that she was spotted at the local mall by a security guard that thought it was strange she was there so long unattended. I her ""why didn't you just call me!?!"" She told me the medications her daddy made her take made her mind fuzzy and her time with me was the only thing that made it all better and she didn't want me to think she wasn't getting better because she didn't want to take the chance of having her visits with me become like living with her Daddy. An investigation was held and it turned out ""Daddy"" had my baby on those meds because he had become addicted to them and wanted to use our daughter to get access to more and the locks had been changed by a landlord that was frustrated by late rent payments and ""Daddy"" was so side tracked that he lost track of time looking for drugs. My daughter's happy now and lives with me and is still seeing a psychologist but no longer taking any of those meds.",,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK612CW3WK
