She was living in another city with her mother at the time. Late one night I got a call from the Police Department in the city my daughter lived saying they had my daughter at the station. First I panicked thinking she had maybe been hurt or possibly broken the law and gotten herself in to trouble. Those worries were soon put to rest but a new one quickly took their place. I was told I needed to pick her up because she had ran away from home. So of course I was on my way to get her soon after. While I was on the way to her I was able to get in touch with her mother. She told me that she had locked her out of the house because she had a friend over after school that she was not supposed to be associating with. I was told that the friend was a drug user and so when they were found together her mother decided to make them leave. This seemed like a rash decision to me considering the first thing my daughter did was go to her friends house. When it was discovered where she had went my daughter's mother called the local police and reported her a runaway. Knowing where she was the police went to the house and picked her up. They took her to the police station where she refused to go back with her mother because she felt unsafe there at that point. Once I arrived I was able to sort things out with child protective services and take her home with me. Since then she has lived with me in my care and in a new city. She has taken the move really well and is getting along much better now.,,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK612CW3WK
