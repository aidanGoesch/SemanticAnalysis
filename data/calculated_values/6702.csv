We hired an air conditioner contractor. This was after much research as well as numerous quotes and checking out many companies. The amount for a new heat/air unit was something we had to take a loan out for. We wanted to get it right because it is a large expense. We chose the company, they came out and we went through our options of different units and chose the best one for our 1,600 sq ft house. We even chose to pay a little more for a brand we trusted. The workers tore out the old unit and put in the new. He did not put in a new thermostat as he forgot to bring the digital one we ordered, he came back 2 days later and asked how the unit was doing, I explained it was very loud and sounded like tennis shoes in a dryer, He checked out the system, made numerous adjustments but could not get the sound to go away. He was confused and asked that I allow him to go and research and call the manufacturer to get ideas on what the problems was. He came back the next day with what we thought was a solution but it still didnt work. In all of his confusion he requested a few more days assuring me it would be taken care of. Another couple of days passes and he comes back with yet another solution from the manufacturer. This again did not work.He then wanted his money but of course, he wasent going to pay him when my brand new air unit sounded like an old dryer. He said because of all of the trouble he would take 10% off of the cost. We agreed and he discounted the price by about $600. He also promised in writing he would take care of the problem or install a brand new unit.A week later he shows up with yet another solution that this time cut the noise down by 75%, we were happy with that and the discount. I paid his worker an additional $150 for other trunkline work done that was not included in the total price. He then said he needed to collect the rest of the money for the air conditioner?? we were shocked what?? you were paid in full. He proceeds to tell us that was a discount just until he got it fixed? What really? I never heard of someone especially a business giving a temporary discount and this was never discussed. He proceeded to become angry that we were not giving the discount back and threatened to sue us for the $600.",3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61QT9W3C,
