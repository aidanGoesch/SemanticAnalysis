After the installation there was a problem with the unit making sounds it shouldent be making. The contractor came back the next day to try to analyze the problem. He could not figure out where the noises were coming from. He sat down at the table with my husband and I and said because of all of the trouble he would give us a 10% good faith discount, He wrote on the contract the 10% subtracted that amount and then I wrote him a check. It took a couple weeks and multiple trips to my house to finally get the unit fixed properly. When it was fixed all of a sudden he asked for the 10% back from us?? We were taken aback and confused. He said he explained that once he fixed it we would give the discount back. That was never mentioned and just sounds ridiculous. He insisted we heard what we wanted and was very angry.  My husband called him and explained this was crazy. Why would a legit business give a discount, and then take it away? He continued to insist he explained this to us in the beginning. He has now threatened to sue us. I am not sure how this will end but we have no intention of paying back a discount, that was given to us.",3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61QT9W3C,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61QT9W3C
