The doctor ordered a scan of my abdomen where I had been complaining of pain for several weeks, and some blood work done. Two weeks ago I received a phone call to come in again to go over those results. Thinking it was just something like an ulcer, or hernia, or something like that, I just assumed my doctor wanted to discuss a treatment, and to prescribe me some possible medications. When he entered the room at his office, he had a very serious look on his face, which came as no comfort to me. He then proceeded to inform me that I had a cancerous growth that was found on my liver. I was in shock, to say the least, and have spent the last couple of weeks since the diagnosis trying to wrap my head around it.  I was told it was serious, and was given three to five years on average to live. I was also told that almost no one beats liver cancer. I have yet to decide on what treatment recommendations to go with, and am preparing myself to discuss this further in the next week or so. My wife is also devastated, and so are our children. In the mean time, I've decided to keep a very positive attitude, as much as possible, with the determination that I plan to be one of the few that beat this disease. I have been trying to go on living as normal as possible since the diagnosis, in order to maximize my quality of life no matter what my future holds. I refuse to allow anyone to tell me I can't beat this, or to let any setbacks get the best of me. I have always been a fighter, and this is no different. I refuse to give up.",,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61RMBW31
