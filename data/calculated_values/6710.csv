Her favorite dinner is spaghetti and meatballs and a huge glass of milk.  And of course we made her a cake. She was so nervous about her first day. But after crying for the bus she was a ball of smiles when she got home. She told us all about her bus ride. The new friends she met on the bus and in class. How she got to buy her own lunch. She was most proud of writing her name on her desk. She really liked her teacher and said she thinks she lives on our street. She said she won't ever want to miss a day of school because of how fun it is. She wants to ride her bike to school when older. She hopes that her little sister will want to do that too. But if not maybe they can roller skate. Tomorrow she is going to wear her Chelsea hat.,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61TBE3WR,
