This reminds me of 5 months ago. The year I got married to my beautiful wife. It was a great and amazing day. It was a day I will never forget in my life. I met my wife in high school. And we've been dating ever since then. We both met eachother and fell in love at first sight. We eventually got married 5 months ago and it was a really beautiful moment. In fact one of the most beautiful moment of my life. The wedding was on my birthday. I can remember vividly, how beautiful my wife looked in the white wedding gown. My family traveled thousands of miles just to be with us and celebrate with us. Glory to God, we have 2 beautiful children together. And we're living our best life.",,3ZWFC4W1UVTUF6UU081POUNH13QFRQ
