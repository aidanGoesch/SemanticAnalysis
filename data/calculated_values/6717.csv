I kept waking up every 20 minutes or so. My husband told me to wake him up again when they got more intense. I labored in my living room for about a hour to the point where I was on my hands and knees. I knew then it was time to get into the car. My husband couldn't find his shoes and I had a feeling he was coming fast so I began to panic. I walked outside and started the car and was pacing in the driveway in the rain. I waited for my husband to get his stuff together and come to the car. He got into the car and said, ""so what are we forgetting."" I then got frustrated because I packed a bag a month early so I didn't have to think about that question while in labor. He drove the speed limit to the hospital as I gripped the sides of my seat every 4 minutes. We finally arrived at the hospital where I was admitted and waited for a room. I puked in the trash can because I was now at 9 cm dilated and he was coming fast. I cussed a bit and the nurses were finally ready to wheel me into my room. I sat on a exercise ball as I tried to work through the contractions. They tried to get a iv in me but for some reason didn't get it in. I signed paperwork while having the worst contraction. They laid me on the bed and within two pushes my son was born. I could stop laughing and smiling in disbelief. My son was finally here and he was perfect. It was one of the best experiences of my life.",,3ZWFC4W1UVTUF6UU081POUNHDM7FRL
