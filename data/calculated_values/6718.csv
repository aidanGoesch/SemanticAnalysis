His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.",,3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO
