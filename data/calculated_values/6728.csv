I was happy as I was going into a new phase of life.  I would have endless opportunities and be more of an adult. However, I never too the time to look at the downsides. With this feeling of independence came additional feeling of loneliness. I never stopped to think about how my life would change for the worse. Lots of my friends were going to different colleges and different cities.  Many of the people that I grew up, I would no longer see so often again. My entire life in terms of the social relationships that I had formed would go on to change.  I would only really come to the brunt realization when I had to say goodbye to my friends. I had stayed home to go to a local college so I had to watch many of my friends leave.  Also when I saw that many of these friends were going on to make new friends, the situation become even more difficult. I felt like I was being replaced as I was not forming new connections like they were.  I felt like I was still in high school while they were actually moving on. The entire transition was just hard.",,
