At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.",,
