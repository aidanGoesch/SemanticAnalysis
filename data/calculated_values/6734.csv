I was at a basketball game it was the championship game the crowd was packed everything was perfect the game was close the whole time all the way until the last play. I had the ball in my hands and I was ready to win the game. I went to the basket for the game winner and missed I was devastated. My team lost I was crying and it made me very emotional because I felt like I let everyone down. After the game we had the award ceremony the worst part I think was standing up trying to smile while receiving runner up trophies. It was the best season that we had and it all came down to one play and I couldn't get it done. It was a lot of emotions going around because my family had came to watch the game and I wanted to put on a show. This event is very significant to me because it showed me how to lose. Winning is probably one of the best feelings in the world but you learn more from a loss. That's why I chose to talk about this story and not any other. This writing task was challenging, and fun in any ways. It made me think while also reminiscing it was a very interesting task. It brought up feelings of regret, anguish, and lastly relief. Mainly because I know that moment is over and it helped shape who I am today I don't have to take it as a failure. This task overall was very fun and interactive as a whole. I look forward to performing well in the second portion.",,
