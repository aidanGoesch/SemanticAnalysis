He started to really develop deep feelings for me, feelings that I did not return in kind. I still continued to date him for a time just to hang out as friends, but then about six months ago I broke up with him as a romantic dating partner to move on with someone else. He was very confused and hurt by this event, and accused me of leading him on and giving him false encouragement, so I ended out friendship and I cut off all contact with him. I felt very guilty for presuming to continue to spend time with someone that I knew I felt zero chemistry with just to have a friend to spend time with. I regretted having to be so abrupt and cold when I broke up with this person, too. I wish there would have been a way to remain friends, because he was a nice person and I enjoyed his company on a friendship level. I was resigned to the fact that this would not be possible after the way things happened and evolved with the break up, though. At first I felt bad for being unable to conjure up feelings that just weren't there for him and for hurting his feelings, but eventually I began to see things in a slightly different way. I think it is quite common for people to have a variety of dating experiences that aren't ideal in some form or other while they're out there searching for people they want to be with romantically. There are never any guarantees or promises in romantic situations in the early stages, before there is any kind of commitment made and while feelings are still developing or unclear. Even if I am not the best judge of chemistry, it is not wrong to end a relationship with someone you don't feel a romantic attraction to. I feel that trying to compromise or settle in dating relationships will cause everyone involved to have unnecessary pain and heartache in the end. So I was sorry for hurting anyone's feelings, but I do not regret doing what I did in the end. I did not wrong anyone by dating them and giving them a fair chance, and by being their friend, simply because I didn't ultimately develop romantic feelings for them in the end.",,
