I've been out of the game for about 3 months now, and while I would never consider going back to it, I do like to reflect every now and then. It all started with a girl I had met in college. A woman, really. She was about 5 years older than me at the time, I 19, she 24. Before I had met her I had no interest in doing any kind of drugs. I was going to school for criminal justice and felt I could have a good future as a police officer. That dream ended when I started smoking. I just wanted her to think that I was cool (spoiler alert, she did not).I hadn't grown up doing a lot of bad things. I hadn't grown up being afraid or wary of the police. So when I drove into a motel parking lot to spark up a bowl (only about a block away from my residence, I had lived with my parents at the time, who were not cool with the MJ). When a cop pulled up to me with his lights on mid bowl hit, I was petrified. The only time I had been stopped by police was for a traffic ticket. Lo and behold, 2 random pills that I had never seen before or heard of in my life materialized in my center console, and I was taken in for possession of a controlled substance. I started selling marijuana to various peoples to pay off my gigantic attorney fee. Fast forward a little bit and I get arrested, again, for having an ounce of weed on me. Since I was driving at the time and the car smelled like weed, I was given a DWAI. I am still working on getting my license back, and in the end it wounded up costing me more trouble than it was worth.",,
