As I was reading the newspaper one day many years ago, I found an advertisement for a rescue dog. Intrigued, I visited the rescue dog shelter. There were many dogs, very excited to see people. There was one, however, that I really connected with. His name was Rufus, a German Shepherd. After talking to the rescue dog shelter volunteer, I applied to adopt a dog and requested Rufus. After waiting on pins and needles for a week, I finally got a call from the rescue dog shelter. Rufus was officially mine, and I can go over to pick him up! For the next 10 years, we had so many good memories. We spent a lot of time on walks, being active in the backyard, and even some of the mischief he had caused.  He had this long face any time he looked at me, but he was a very happy dog whenever we had visitors or just going about everyday life. The joy he brought into my life is immeasurable. After 10 years, he passed away from old age.  I was heartbroken. I knew the time would come, but I never wanted it to. The bond Rufus and I had will remain with me together, and I cannot wait to see him again.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J54BVIDI
