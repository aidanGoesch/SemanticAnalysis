It was quite a bizarre and memorable moment. We were in a bus when all of a sudden one of the passengers started throwing homophobic jabs at me. It was bizarre in the sense that I never did anything whatsoever to provoke this passenger. He was so mean. Very aggressive. Out of nowhere stood my defender. She was so blunt and candid that I got attracted to her immediately. Her courage to speak up was impeccable  She cautioned my abuser at length. She made it clear that he was the type that brings a bad name to the USA. Made him realize how wrong he was. He eventually apologized for his unruly behavior, and we had a peaceful trip until we reached out destination. It was an unforgettable experience because that was how I got to meet the lady that turned out to be my wife. We've been living together ever since. I'll never forget that day.",,
