We went out of town, to a baseball game. we got even caught one of the game balls. We were really grateful that we got to finally go on a trip together. The team we were cheering for at the time didn't actually win but that was ok. We got to explore the town together. Go to a lot of different restaurants, we ate a lot of food . We stayed at a great hotel they gave us free breakfast which we really enjoyed . We went to a couple of museums. We got to learn a little bit of interesting things about history that neither of us new about. we went swimming almost every day and night. We took a lot of pictures. we even took pictures with a baseball player. We went dancing at night once. The most fun was us being together. We loved going to the baseball game. We hope that our next game will be even more fun.",,
