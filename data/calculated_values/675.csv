This has been one of the hardest days of my life.   I lost my little friend, Prance.   I should start by saying that Prance was a rescue dog.  Prance came from a local shelter.  Prance was 3 years old when I got him.   The day, April 17,  that I got Prance was exactly a year to the day that I had lost another dog, Butch.   Like Butch, Prance was a Schnauzer.   I woke up that morning and just had a strong desire to go to the animal shelter. And there was Prance.     From the first moment, we bonded, and he was like my little grey shadow. April 17th 2019, I treated  the day like it was Prance's birthday, since he actual birth date was unknown.    He had turned 12.   Prance had always been a very picky eater and he had started refusing his food.   On the 4th day of not eating, I took Prance to the vet.   Prance had pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized.   When Prance came home, he was refusing to eat again.    Prance began to get very weak and had difficulty standing up.     He was now at a point where he could not walk at all.   Prance was laying next to me, as he always was, while I watched TV.    Prance suddenly reached out his paw to me 3 times, like he would do when he wanted to get some attention.   I picked Prance up and held him.   Prance began to tremble and shake.   He took a couple of deep breathes and went limp in my arms.      I  feel like Prance reached out to me to say goodbye, and e I am happy that I was there  for him in his last moment of life.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J54BVIDI
