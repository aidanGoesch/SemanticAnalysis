I studied a lot for this test but thought about what would happen if I were to score low on the test. I was up almost all night before the test thinking about this and couldn’t really sleep. I knew I was prepared but I heard the test was really hard. I decided to relax and be detached from the outcome. The morning finally came and the time was up. I picked up my bag and then started the test. It took me around 3 hours to complete it but the whole time I was nervous, some of the answers I knew but my mind suddenly forgot all about them. I tried to do my best and came out of the test wanting to know the results already. I was really nervous and fidgety. The results finally came and I made it, I was so happy because all my hard work had paid off. I even had a higher grade than expected and decided to celebrate with my friends and family. I had a great time with them and they all congratulated me because of my accomplishment. I guess being nervous in this situation was unavoidable. . I felt great and accomplished and now its time to think about new goals.",,
