Loki, our Pomchi, was going to be made homeless if we did not intervene. He was love at first site, as my Wife and I quickly approached the people who were trying to give him away. It was like welcoming a new baby on the day we received him. The ride home was a little bumpy and it upset Loki's stomach a bit. As my wife carried him to the front door the pup vomited all over her. This has certainly been an adventure over the last few months. Sometimes it feels as if we are raising a child. When I think back to the day we brought him home, I knew we were in love with him. However, I never though it would progress to the love we have now. He sleeps with my wife and I. He follows us everywhere we go. We are still working on his Separation Anxiety, but he is slowly making progress. If we were gonna get a pet, I am glad it was this one. Loki, will be forever a part of my family, and my hope is through this essay, he will fill your hearts as well.",,
