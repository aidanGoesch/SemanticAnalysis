We went for a trip to the beautiful hill station last month. It was a nice family trip where we enjoyed a lot. The trip started on a breezy Sunday morning. We hired a van from our home and my uncle’s family accompanied us. We boarded a lodge at 10 ‘o clock in the morning and the weather so cold that we were freezing like a statue. After getting ready with all our jackets over us we went to the Thunder world which was a very different theme zone I have ever seen.  The botanical garden and rose garden were so amazing. It was a great scene to see so many flowers all together. They all looked as if they were smiling at us.

The trip was so wonderful that it cannot be explained simply in words. The trip to Ooty was definitely one of the most memorable ones in my life. Today my tenth board exam results have been declared. Until 2'o clock, my heart was beating very fast. As soon as I saw my result I felt that I was on the top of this world. I have come first in my school.

I was at the top of the world after I came to know that I was the topper of my school. I will always remember this day as it was one of the best days of my life.  I was away on a long weekend with a group of my best friends, sitting around, drinking and having fun when something struck me. I wondered how this had happened? ​The most healthy person in the room had recently completed an Iron​ ​Man triathlon, so I had a pretty high benchmark to ​meet.  Fast forward a few years​ and ​I have completed 30+ marathons​ and ​ultra marathons and I think I did just fine.- Daniel Da Vinci   I was sitting in my room with some friends when I got a call from my dad's number. I thought he was going to ask about the interview that I had just",,
