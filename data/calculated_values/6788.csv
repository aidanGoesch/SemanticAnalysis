I had been heart broken by my ex-girlfriend. It was really an exciting encounter. I was learning how to swim when she can into the pool in her swimming dress. she looks very ravaging and i could not stop looking at her. After the  swimming classes, i ask her out for a date. At first,she turn my offer down but after much pressure she finally agreed after she new that we went to the same high school. Am always elated when i remembered the lines i used for her. I told her that she was a paragon of beauty and a typical example of God's perfection in human creation. She agreed to be my girlfriend and she filled the vacuum that my ex-girlfriend has created. I have been dating her now for two months and there has never been a better yesterday. We are both black Americans. I am totally in love with her. She is a good match. I am always happy when am around her. We share so many things sin common like the same high school,color,birthday and temperament.",,
