I have always been a Beatles fan and Paul is my absolute favorite. My husband is not a rock music fan so this gesture was truly meaningful me as I knew he would go to the concert, but it may not be his favorite way to spend an evening. We also lost part of our income last year so this was truly a splurge for us. When the evening finally came we found babysitters for our kids and made the trip across town for dinner and then to the show. It was our first time visiting this particular venue so it was definitely an adventure getting there and figuring out parking. We had gotten there early so we had a chance to just sit and relax before the concert started. And then there was about a 30 minute delay to the actual concert. Once the concert started though I knew that everything we had gone through to get there had been worth it. I'm not too proud to say that I teared up when Paul took the stage. He sang a lot of my favorites and the stage was lit up with images of him with the Beatles, Wings, and his later solo career. There was even a huge fireworks display that shook the entire stadium. I clapped, yelled, and sang along and my husband also seemed to have a great time. This might have been the best birthday present ever. It was definitely a night I won't ever forget.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J5E8JIDA
