Ont his day my small niece was graduating pre school. I among  her parents and my parents attended. Once the ceremony was over my parents escorted my niece out side to take pictures. That is when it all fell apart. My son decided to photo bomb a picture and my mother got mad and stated ""I just wanted on good picture"". Then the mouth vomit from me happened. I not so nicely told her i was sick of my niece having favorites on her. I was tired of my son being shut out from it and how it hurt his feelings. She then stated that i was wrong where as i choose to leave and her response was just like always run. I then texted her and told her that i was unimpressed by the way she acted, and i was done with the favoritism. She in returned texted me that i was wrong and that was not what happened but it was my choice to leave.",,
