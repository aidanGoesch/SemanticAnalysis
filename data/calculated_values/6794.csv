We had been struggling to find a reason to continue our marriage; most of the spark had died out in our relationship and we were mostly coasting through our lives. We had reached a level of comfort that bred complacency, and each of us felt like we held the other back. When it happened, it was actually unexpected. We were going to a marriage counselor and getting nowhere. Our issues butted heads with each other and we were at an impasse, where we needed to let each other go in order to reach new ground. Neither of us wanted to be the person who made the first cut, so we tried everything we could to make it work. I really wanted to make it work. I loved being with her, we fit together so well and I'd never met anyone who meshed with me like she did. We went in to the marriage counselor and sat down on those stiff armchairs with scratchy pillows. Until now I felt as though our counselor was mediocre, that the discussion really led nowhere. The counselor looked at us both and asked what we wanted to do. I was confused and asked for clarification. She asked where there was to go from here, she wanted us both to ask ourselves that question, as to her eyes there was no direction and no progress happening. I stumbled through weak suggestions, each seeming more limp than the next. She swatted them away like flies and kept pressing us. I looked at my wife and back to the counselor, and I said that if these options were fruitless, the only other available option would be to break apart. I started to feel the tears in my eyes and talked about how this felt like being in a boat with a single oar, and the counselor agreed. My wife looked resigned and admitted that she thought it was also the best course of action.",,
