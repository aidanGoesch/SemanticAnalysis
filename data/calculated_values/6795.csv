She said maybe. A couple days before the festival I asked if she had her schedule. To find out if she would be able to make it. She said she would be able to make it, and we can meet up there. She didn't give a set time she would be there. So I spent the entire day at the festival. Around mid day she showed up in her work uniform. I asked her if she was just getting off work. She looked frustrated, almost to the point of tears when she told me she was just heading in. They had suckered her into taking an extra shift that night. But she wanted to let me know she wouldn't be able to make our date. I was disappointed, but touched that she wold come down in person to tell me that. A few minutes after she left, I felt a small hand at the small of my back. I turned and it was her. She was frantic. She had lost her key and was wondering if I had seen it. I immediately offered to help her look. She took off towards her car, and I followed, looking around. Her friends spotted her running off in a frantic state, with a man following her. They came running after us, they calmed a bit after hearing about the key, but they still stayed between the two of us for the rest of the search. As we were almost to her car I spotted the edge of something black at the under a thick bush. It was her key! She was so happy to have it back that she threw her arms around me to hug me. The look of happiness on her face as she did is something I will never forget.",,
