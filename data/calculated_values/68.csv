I was heading to the movies with a friend who had been begging me to go see it for days, although now I can't even fully recall which it was. There wasn't a lot of time for me to think as I was still groggy, so I quickly went back inside to grab a cup of coffee before heading out. Turning on the machine and hearing it whirr to start up I decided that I would also flick on the television real fast just to see what was going on in the world. I honestly can't remember what I saw, as my mind is blurry from the entire thing but I do remember it being quite boring to the point of remarkability, but what did stick out was the traffic alert. We were going to be late to the movie if we didn't leave soon so I quickly grabbed whatever coffee had been finished and rushed out the door having a completely black cup of joe that I didn't even want anymore. My friend was waiting for me at her house when I picked her up and was a bit annoyed that I was late, but I didn't think much of it. Now this is the part that really, really stuck out to me. Right as she got into the car, her daughter quickly ran outside and called her back in. When she came back out she was bright red and told me that she couldn't go, that she had to stay home and didn't want to explain but I was adamant and so she did. Apparently the babysitter couldn't make it in time and so it was all a bust, but instead of letting her feel bad I drove home real quick and picked up a blu-ray of a movie that I figured she would enjoy and drove back to her house. At this point you can probably realize this isn't exactly just a friend, but someone who I had wanted to impress and so when I returned and showed her the blu-ray we watched it together and it was a pretty awesome experience. The entire time all I could think was about how lucky I was to be in this house with her and her family, who seemed to be pretty receptive of me. Anyways, once this was all over instead of leaving she offered for me to stay for dinner and this is the first time I would ever have a meal with her alone as her daughter took a nap right after eating a few minutes earlier. This is so memorable for me because it was the first experience that I had in a romantic setting with this woman who I am now currently dating and I'll never forget it.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M18XYX0I
