He had some energy in his cage. I cleaned him. He was at the pet store. I volunteered to clean him up. I eventually adopted the cat. He has a nice coat of orange fur to him. He likes to drink milk whenever he sees it. He loves to eat tuna. That is his favorite meal. I got a big box of kitty litter for him. He always fills up by the end of the week. I guess I need to put the cat on a diet. I will restrict his diet to two cans of tuna a day. I hope he lose weight because of this restriction in the diet. He loves jumping on my lap. He really loves getting petted in the mornings. I hope to have a great life with him.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J5WEKDI0
