We were in our evening service, when during it, someone busted through our back doors and into the congregation. It was two gentlemen who had robbed us a year prior. At first we were all uptight, and ready to move, as we could not believe they were back to ruin us again. Well, they didn't. The were dressed nicely, and solemnly walked down the aisle to the front, asked everyone to rise, and apologized to us, and said they had found God. He wanted to go from pew to pew to sahek everyone in the church's hand. A very nice gesture. Along with it, they said sorry to all of us. It was truly touching, and we actually had them baptized later on that night. They have now joined our congregation and we are happy for that. It is not everyday that someone just does a 360 like that. We opened our arms to them after that night, and I think that helped. They are trusting and hard working, and want to truly get better. We as a family, are ready to help them down that tough path. It will be a journey. The true power of God and change has shined through!!!!",,
