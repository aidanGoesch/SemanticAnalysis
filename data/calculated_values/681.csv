One of the cats was being very squirmy and energetic while his cage was being cleaned, so I walked over and offered to hold it while she straightened everything out.  He almost immediately settled down and started purring in my arms, rubbing his head against my chin, and closing his eyes.    I struck up a conversation with the woman about the cat because he had a very distinct personality.  We talked a bit about his adoption history and how he'd been returned several times by past adopters.  But after hearing and reading about his ""behavioral issues,"" I couldn't gel them with the experience I was having with the cat I was holding.  I spent almost an hour asking questions about the cat, working up to the idea that I'd be taking him home with me.  The whole time he was just purring in my arms and didn't want to go back in his cat condo or even get back down.  We made some calls to the rescue head and I arranged to borrow a carrier for him and pay his adoption fee by check later.  I took him home that night.  It was touch and go for awhile, because he'd moved around so much and it took a few weeks to get him fully integrated with my other cats, but he eventually bonded with a younger female I took in last year.  She spent a few weeks under the couch when he first came home, so it's amazing that they're such good friends now.  They spend their days cuddling on the couch and have taken to taking care of a younger kitten I adopted since.  He's a very affectionate cat that is very emotionally perceptive, and he'll always jump in your lap if he senses you've been having a bad day.  He's a member of this family now and he's been renamed Kismet because everything around the situation just seemed like it was fated.",33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J5WEKDI0,
