This is the highest paved road in North America and sits just outside of Denver, Colorado. We took this excursion while we were on our first vacation without kids since our honeymoon; we have been married for just over 13 years. The event was emotional because the views on the way up the mountain were striking. You could see a number of other peaks across Colorado as you made the ascent and the landscape was beautiful. There were snow-covered mountain sides and a lake on the way up the mountain where you could get out and explore. We walked a number of trails. At times, the trails made me nervous as they were on the sides of high elevations and there weren't a lot of supports around. I was stressed at times that I was at risk of falling. The most memorable part of the trip was when we came across a herd of mountain goats near the top of the mountain. They would come right up to the side of the car and had no apprehension about the presence of humans. They were fun to observe, particularly the young goats in the herd, as they would frolic and play on the hillside. Though the event was memorable, it was also something that could be frustrating at times. It was crowded on the mountain that day. This wasn't unexpected, as the road is only safe to travel for roughly two to three months out of the year. But many people were driving in an unsafe manner. Some sped down the mountain. Others were not paying attention because they were distracted by the scenery. That added to the stress of the drive, which was somewhat nerve-wracking to begin with because the road was very narrow and didn't always feel safe. Arriving at the mountain top made it worth it though, as the view was breath taking. That said, it was hard to breath due to the high elevation at the summit, as the mountain is more than 14,000 feet up. I would do it again if given the chance. I even told my wife that it would be nice to take the kids to see the mountain and make the drive someday. It is an experience that I hope I never forget.",,
