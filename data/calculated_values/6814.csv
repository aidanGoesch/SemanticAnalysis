Being the second highest ranking person, I should have been promoted to her position. At least on a Interim basis. Unfortunately, the Board decided to hire a extremely under qualified part time staff member. He was hired because he is friends with the board chair. This has been especially concerning since I have been at this job for over 15 years. This has me thinking that our board is actually not very fair and doesn't actually uphold the ideals of the organization. I am now thinking of changing jobs. the problem is I am good at my job. I also Like my Job. It is disappointing to have to look for another job due to cronyism. The organization I work for is suppose to be trustworthy. I guess I was wrong. Again this causes concern because I believed in the organization mission. It is what it is though.",,
