The wedding was held back in August. I was very nervous about it. I generally don’t have a fear of speaking in public but I wanted to really ensure I got this right for my friend and his wife. I practiced a lot and took a ton of time to write out a heart felt speech. I was so nervous leading up the event but when the day came I actually felt calm. The wedding went great and my part went off without a hitch. It get great and very releaving to get through it and be done!  I’ve heard a lot of feedback that the guests enjoyed my speech and I’m happy it went so well. My friend was very happy having choose me to officiant not only to save money I heard!  His new wife was pleased as well and the guests enjoyed the ceremony I set up and provided. I would certainly do this again now having  been through it. I was at first really hesitant. I was of course honored but had no experience doing this. All in all, I’m glad I did this for my friend.",,
