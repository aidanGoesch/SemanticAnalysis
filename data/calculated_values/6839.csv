The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",,
