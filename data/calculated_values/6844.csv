In most cultures, birthdays are celebrated in some of the same ways. Often, birthdays are celebrated with a gift, party, or some other special act. main event this Falling in love with the person that is your perfect fit is one of the best feelings in the world. Although it's not uncommon to find yourself falling in love (or simply, lust) with the wrong person before getting to Mr. Right, when you finally meet the guy for you, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Everything you thought you knew about love and relationships will suddenly be turned on its head. And it's not just love you'll feel - you'll go through a whole host of other positive emotions. Here are some of the things you can expect to feel when you start falling for the right someone. When I met my husband, the primary emotion I remember feeling was shock. It sounds nuts, but I truly couldn't believe he even existed. I had spent so much time before not even sure if I wanted to be in a relationship. I didn't really believe that true love was real, and I definitely didn't think I'd ever feel so strongly about someone that I wanted to be with forever. Falling in love with the right person will leave you feeling surprised, like you didn't see it coming. You'll marvel at the fact that someone so perfect for you even exists - let alone loves as much as they do, too. In prior relationships, I would purposely not express how I was feeling most of the time, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. It could be the biggest thing, like disappointment over a friend moving, to the smallest, like moodiness from PMS. It didn't matter - if it was a real feeling, I kept it to myself. With my husband, however, I want to do the exact opposite: share everything with him. When you're with the right someone, you'll know because you'll feel safer than you ever have in the past. In relationships before my husband, I knew what it was like to feel momentarily excited (or even happy) for a little bit.",,
