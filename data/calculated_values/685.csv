She said your best friend and I had a chat the other day. She said that he had feelings for her. He had told her about a time in college when I got really drunk and engaged in some gay behavior. He also told her about other times in college that were very embarrassing. It was crazy . I thought he was my best friend. Now I realize that he only wanted my fiancee for himself. He didn't give a damn about me. He is a shady person and that he only has one goal. He wanted to steal my fiancee from me. I was disgusted. I realized thatyou cannot trust anyone. It was so disappointing. I guess I realized I valuable lesson from it. I realized that humans are only out for their own good. They don't care about friends.,,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3Z8MRZRS
