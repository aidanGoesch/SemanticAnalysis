I used to love when my grandmother would come over to babysit me. She always had the best stories to tell and would love to play games with me all the time. One game she loved was her special memory game. She would have these different colored cards with strange words on one side and pictures on the other. I didn't realize it at the time, but she was teaching me to speak Russian which is where she was from. At the time I just thought it was a fun game where I would get sweet candy rewards when I would win. It wasn't until I was older that I realized I had been learning another language all this time. Once I had my own family I decided that I would carry on the tradition. Whenever my young kids want to play, I pull out the same cards that I used to learn from. My grandmother left them to me when she passed away. Playing with my kids and watching them learn has been a great experience for me. I know now how my grandmother felt when she was teaching me. Not only am I having fun with my family, but I am helping to keep alive the family tradition. Hopefully one day my kids will play the same game with their own families.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZDYQZRK
