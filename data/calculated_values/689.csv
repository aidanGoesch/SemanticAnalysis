When I could say, for example, Psalm 23 or Psalm 100 from memory, she would give me a special treat that she baked. My mom and I used to go walking together and talk. We would end up at a local small shop where she would buy me a candy bar. As I grew up, we always walked and talked. My dad used to run with me outside. He was fast and I always looked forward to the day when I would beat him running from one side of the yard to the other. For my own family, my husband has one on one time with each of our six children each week, and then rotates taking them out to eat. For birthdays, we always have a birthday blessing where we each say a prayer out loud for the birthday person. We have done that since our children were born. We have lots of traditions and fun things. I have enjoyed reading all of these. A rich spiritually deep and meaningful heritage I have with my grandmother. she taught me everything i know and now as i pass it down to my children, all our memories grow along side tradition and legacy. filled with joy and love and values you couldn't possible get from any where else in life.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZDYQZRK
