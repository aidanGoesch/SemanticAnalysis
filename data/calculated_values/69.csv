Into the woods. It was an odd occurrence. I decided to do everything myself. Cook my own food. Chop down my own tree for heat and food purposes. I wanted to be one with nature. It went well at first, but then I knew I didn't know exactly what I was doing. On some tasks I knew. Like getting wood already on the ground. As far as the axe, I hadn't used one before. So I needed to, or else I would starve. And freeze at night. So after learning the basics I felt everything went smoothly. It is something I want to do again. And next time I will know so much more and be quicker about things.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8SX0M
