Its not at all where I thought my life would end up. Sure, I play games but nothing major nor things that younger people would consider a ""game"". But I like to talk and think I am fairly friendly. My wife was the one who brought up the idea. I honestly think that she was just tired of hearing me go on and on and wanted a break. So I signed up. My first stream no one showed up. It was discouraging for sure. But I decided to try again. My next stream had a title that I thought would work. Before I knew it I started getting people in my chat. I was able to talk while they asked questions or just made comments. My biggest surprise came though when I got my first donation. It was small but...It felt really good. I felt appreciated for my views and personality.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZPLAZRQ
