I'm talking fever, unable to breathe, things like that. She absolutely needed to go to a hospital but refused to go because she'd had a bad experience before. We argued about it a lot for a few days until I put my foot down.  She was too weak to stop me and I carried her to the car to take her in myself. She couldn't fight me about it, and the doctors all agreed she'd needed to come in. She got better after taking the medicines they gave her, but she was so mad at me and refused to talk to me for days. I refused to apologize for doing what was right but she still wouldn't see that! Things got really really tense and we both said some pretty nasty things to one another for like, weeks at a time. It got to the point that I was sleeping on the couch! After a couple more weeks of this I decided I'd had enough. I sat her down, told her I was glad she was better, but that I couldn't do this any more. I broke up with her then and there and left our apartment for my Dad's. We haven't spoken to one another since.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZPRYZRQ
