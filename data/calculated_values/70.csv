It was a great way to get away from the family, and I was very thrilled to be doing so. I brought my larger tent, as I felt the 2-man tent was not going to cut it. I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old! The strange thing is that it was on top of a mountain, so someone had to come up here to build it. I feel it was an appropriate place, as the area was quite beautiful and had a wonderful view. I really enjoyed my camping trip up in the woods and got some much needed relaxation and time to myself, without the chattering of my wife and children to distract me. I plan on doing this again and cannot wait until my next trip.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8SX0M
