The person I saw do this made it seem like it was so easy. I like to cook but this porn recipe seemed like something that I had never done before. It also just looked good, plus my wife loves that kind of food. I know she was proud that we were taking a vacation together, and this would really just top it off. We were always going to have a party with friends coming over before we left, so this just seemed like the best time to do it. I also got to use the smoker on my bar bq pit that I really never got to use, so that was a plus. It was just nice to be able to grill or smoke again, besides making my wife and our friends and family happy, it also gave me inspiration to do more cooking and grilling from now on. I think something else that really made me feel good was people asked for the recipe. But I had to give the person on youtube credit which I did every time someone asked me. My wife was really surprised that I was cooking for her, which made me nervous before it was done. But as soon as I knew she liked it when she tried, I was relived. Her opinion was really the only one that mattered to me in the end. It does help that everyone who tried said they liked it. I think this went so well and the night was so special that this dish and kind of night could be a yearly tradition going forward. I really learned a lot about myself and what makes my wife happy in the end.",,33TIN5LC05WUBXF3BHTRMUU3394Y9D
