We have known each other for over 6 years now and she feels more like a sister than a friend to me. We first met in college, back in the day, two young girls barely entered the new world met and started the journey together. At first, I didn't like her at all and it was for no reason. However, after spending years studying together, we gradually got close. As I stood next to her, I was overwhelmed with feelings. I witnessed her with every guy she dated, for countless time I comforted her while she cried over a heartbreak. However, today, someone deserves her finally came and took her hand. I remembered back when they first started dating, out of my protecting instinct, I was skeptical about the new guy. I was worried he would break her heart again just like her exes. Over the time, he proved himself that not only he deserves her, but also he's the best one you can think of as her husband. I looked at my best friend getting married to her love when unexpectedly, a baby cried out loud right after she said ""I do"" to her husband. Everyone almost laughed out loud due to the coincidence. Obviously, the a crying kid is never pleasant but because of the oddly right timing, it had become one of the most memorable events at the wedding. During that time, I couldn't help but thinking about my own special day and hopefully, my best friend will be there with her family.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8T0XQ
