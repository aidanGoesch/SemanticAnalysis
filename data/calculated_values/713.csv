I haven't talked to her in about 15 years prior. It really took me by surprise because I never knew what happened to her after we went our separate ways. I did always think of her though. So, she wrote me a really casual message saying hey, how are you. We made some small talk for a while. Then she told me she would be coming down to Florida and wanted to see me. I was really surprised by that, but I saw no reason we couldn't get together as friends. So we made plans to have dinner and drinks to catch up. I was so nervous because it's been so long. I actually started to get some of those old feelings back. She was my first love after all. So it was Friday night and we met at the bar in Chili's. When I saw her my heart was beating so fast. We hugged and ordered some drinks and food. She seemed nervous too, but we ended up having such a fun conversation. We talked about old times, but more so what we have done with our lives. She was really proud of who I am today, because I used to be such a punk. When it was time to leave she kissed me and said she missed me. That kiss felt so good, but we didn't take it any further than that as we are both in relationships.",33UKMF931A6HEQPNZHB95D30BBITTZ,
