When I knew that my birthday was approaching, I thought that maybe I just wouldn't try to celebrate it at all. It just wouldn't be the same without mom. Mom would always plan the family events, and it would be too hard without her there. But then my aunt reached out to me and suggested we still have a party. It made me feel special and made me think, it would be good to get the family together. Maybe it would help us each heal a little faster, having each other there for support. My family could see how much I was struggling, as they were, but they also helped me out financially and that made me feel really loved. When we had the party, I cried the morning of it. But then when everyone showed up, I felt great. I was relieved that I had family around. We ate cake and food and they sang to me. I opened up some nice presents, and one of them was a photo album with a lot of photos of all of us family members with my mom. We all cried together, but they were happy cries. Not all memories have to be sad, they can make us happy too! I will always remember mom fondly and be sure to spend even more time with the rest of my family, because we can all help each other out. I am so blessed!",,340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNXTNUVX
