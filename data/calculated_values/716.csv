We have recently started to spend time together again. My birthday was in June. Traditionally, I would spend my birthday with my mother. We would go to a movie, and then out to eat, and we would end the day with birthday cake. Since my mother died two years ago, my birthday has been very sad. But this year, I invited her sister and brother to share the day with me. We went to see The Secret Life of Pets 2, which we all enjoyed. We had a nice lunch out together. And then we came back to my house for birthday cake. They really made the day special and memorable for me. If I couldn't spend it with my mom, at least I could spend it with people who loved her as much as I did. We had such a good time that day that we decided to re-start some old family traditions that I remember from my childhood. Since then we have also celebrated my uncle's birthday and had a great time that day too. We are making plans for Thanksgiving and Christmas. I am happy that my birthday celebration was the beginning of healing old rifts in my family.",340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNXTNUVX,340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNXTNUVX
