We studied together till 8th grade. After that we joined the same college. We spent weekends also together. Due to his fater's job transfer, he moved out. As a parting gift, he got a persian cat. It was chocolate brown cute pet. I just loved it. It was always with me. It would eagerly wait for my arrival at the door step. It will brush against me, if i neglect petting it.  It will keep its tail erect when there is an urge for it go out to poop. It was a well behaved pet. It was with me during my marriage. It was there when my child was born. When my son was 8 years, it died due to old age. We were all very badly traumatized by its departure. We missed it every moment of the day. We finally decided to get a new pet kitten.",,340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNZFPUV9
