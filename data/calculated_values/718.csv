A few months later, I wanted to adopt a new cat. However, most cats at the animal shelter were sick. Thus, I contacted several of non-profit animal rescue group, and I learned how hard this group make it for people to adopt. So, my search continued. I almost gave up on the possibility of adopting a new cat. When one Saturday early afternoon, I walk downstairs to the parking lot, and my 3-year-old sees a stray cat. The cat was sunbathing on the side of the walkway. We walked over to the cat to greet and pet, and the cat ended up being so friendly. Since I was unsure if the cat belongs to someone, I left the cat alone but came back to check on it. The cat followed us home and stayed outside the whole day in front of our door. Several of days later, the cat was still hanging out in front of our doorsteps and thatâ€™s when I realized that we had been adopted by the stray cat. The cat had joined out family and is living with us now. The cat is an outdoor cat, but he stays close to home. He will come to eat and sleep. This little cat ended up being such a great adition to our family.",,340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNZFPUV9
