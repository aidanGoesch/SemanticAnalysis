He worked at an electronic shop as a sales representative so he did not make enough money yet he spends much more than he earns. It was that bad that i sometimes began to imagine how Jennifer managed to put up with all of his excesses .The most devastating problem about Nathan was that he was a chronic womanizer. In the course of there relationship he has cheated on Jennifer more than seven times, the ones i can still remember or would i say the ones he was caught and could not deny them. Jennifer was sometimes traumatized and always caught in an emotional blackmail. She suffered a lot during the six years of there relationship. I could not understand why she keeps condoling his act of cheating on her. So one day she cried and came to me to complain about how Nathan has just cheated on her i was so mad at her, Nathan and her entire relationship that i screamed at her attempting to give a  piece of my mind. I asked her what she was doing with that good for nothing man, she told me she loved him so much and that she has tried to stop loving him but cannot. the more she tries the more the love increases and how she can not live without him . In frustration i told her to leave my house and that i did not want to hear about Nathan and her relationship with him ever again. both after two years their relationship was still on. Nathan had apologized to her and she forgave him as always and there were back together. Nathan got some religion into his life, he is now a christian. Jennifer told me how everything about Nathan has tremendously changed. I saw the joy i hadn't seen in her for a long time i was happy for her. I was so shocked one morning when she told me that Nathan proposed and she accepted and she would want me to be her maid of honor on her wedding day i was honored to do it and so i was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding. I stood by her and watched her marry her husband.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8T0XQ
