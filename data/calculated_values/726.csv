She's really excited, and I'm happy for her, but I'm worried too. I know the doctors say her tumor is not aggressive, and that her situation is good, but it's still cancer. Amsterdam has excellent health care options, but her doctors here are very good and know her case. She says it's not a big deal and that she'll still be doing a lot of her tests when she flies back here, but still. The insurance situation is complicated, too. She says her company deals with this sort of thing all the time, and that they know what to do, but there's a difference between someone who's insurance is just in case and her situation. She can't afford any lapses or mistakes, and I'm not convinced everything will work out as smoothly as she thinks. Still, she's incredibly excited, and this does seem like a great opportunity for her. It's not my place to tell her what she can and can't do, so all I can do is be supportive and try to make sure she's doing everything she can to stay healthy. Not that she needs much help, she's been incredibly motivated not to let this thing stop her. That's probably part of why she's so all-in about this job. At least, for the first time in her life, she's moving and I don't have to help. Her company is taking care of everything, and except for one chair that I grudgingly agreed to store for her I don't have to lift a finger. She may or may not get the chair back. I hope I look back on this entry and see it as the start of good things and me being too protective. I'm still worried, though.",345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL48VVU3B,345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL48VVU3B
