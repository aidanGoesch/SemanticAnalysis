It prevents me from impulse shopping. I double checked my bank account balance just before heading out to get cat food today. It's the last necessity for the month and as expected, I had just enough so I left the house with nothing but my card and a few dollars in change. My card was declined twice. I asked the cashier to hang onto my stuff for a few minutes so I could step outside and call my bank to sort it out. It turns out that only moments before, my bank withdrew my monthly fees. They were a week early so I wasn't impressed but I still had enough if I used the change I had. It was a pain in the ass but not a financial crisis so I headed back in and stood in line again. A woman who was just finishing up at the cash walked to the back of the line and handed me my purchase with a smile and said she'd already taken care of it. I thought I was going to cry. I've had a really rough week dealing with PTSD flashbacks and this lady touched me hard in the feels. I let her know I got the problem sorted out and could pay for it but she declined so I said ""Well, thank you! That was very sweet. If I can't pay it back, I guess I'll just have to pay it forward."" She made my day. Next time I'm out, I'll make someone else's day.",,345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL4ZWCU3L
