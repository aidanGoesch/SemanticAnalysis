The wedding was a great time and I got drunk but didn't puke. I celebrated by myself by going to lighthouses. The first lighthouse was very big and red. It was shining from a few miles away. The second lighthouse was tiny and green. It only had a mile shining radiance. The third lighthouse was giant and blue. It could shine a light for ten miles. I had a fun time in the beaches. I got sand all over my shorts. It took forever to get the sand out. I went surfing but crashed. I got salt water in my mouth. That was nasty. The trip was very nice.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WPI126U
