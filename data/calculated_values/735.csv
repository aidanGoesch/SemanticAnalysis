I never thought I'd be able to, but some friends wanted to go and they offered to pay for me, so who am I to say now? I had never been on vacation before. It was a new experience because I was very unfamiliar with having free time. Luckily, I have a line of work that is conducive to me being able to take time off. With that time, I was able to enjoy myself. My friends took me site seeing, and there are truly wondrous places on this planet. I thought sometimes they only existed in pictures. Lest I forget, that there are options that are outside of my own jurisdiction. Hard to imagine sometimes there is more to live than a 9-5. I'm thankful for my friends to introduce me to a location not like my own. We had amazing tropical drinks and delicious food too. I never thought I could be a part of something so great. There is good in the world. I think I'll come back sometime.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WW2E26I
