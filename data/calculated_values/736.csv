We went on a two week vacation, and stayed in a nice 5 star hotel with everything included. It was my first time going to a Caribbean island, and I was very excited. The water was clear, the sand was white, and it was very hot. I enjoyed myself quite a bit. The most memorable part of the vacation was touring through the island, and seeing so many historic monuments, and places. We took a lot of pictures, and appreciated our time together while on vacation. We attended a few parties, that the locals were having at their place of residence, and also had quite a few drinks. When we had a few drinks, I noticed my friends and I, started dancing. The music was very good, and the food was also delicious. They cook with different ingredients and a lot of the food were spicy. We also went snorkeling, and scuba diving, which was very fun because so saw a lot of different type of fishes, and marine life under the water. Every evening we would sit on the beach, relax, and have a few drinks. The sunsets were amazing, and it felt like paradise. I will never forget that vacation, and I plan on going back soon.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WW2E26I
