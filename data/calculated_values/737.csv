It's such a thankless job, and no one appreciates what I do. Not to mention, that the job doesn't even pay much. I just want something different in life. I want something better. Something good. So I decided to apply for grad school. And guess what? I was accepted! I'm so glad that I got accepted because I really didn't expect to get accepted. But I got accepted anyways. So yeah, life is good and I will work hard to make sure that this pays off. I know it will. I will get the highest grade, and comes out on top. When I graduate I will get a better, easier, and highest paying job. Life will be good.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WWDE264
