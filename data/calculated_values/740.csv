I've loved my son from the moment he was born. My wife and I have watched him grow and develop over the course of 11 months. He smiles and laughs all the time, especially when he sees me. There's nothing else on Earth quite like being a father.  And then the moment my wife and I have been waiting for finally happened. 4 months ago, he took his first steps. I was sitting on the floor, about 10 feet away from my wife. She was holding him by his hands, and he climbed up to his feet as she helped him. Her smile was so big, and he giggled at her reaction. My heart began to pound. Was he finally going to do it? Was this the day? She pointed at me and said, ""Go to daddy!"" He looked over at me, then back at her. She smiled and pointed to me again. ""Go to daddy!"" He turned back to me, reached one hand towards me, and I opened my arms wide. At that moment, he picked up one foot and stepped out towards me. My heart jumped with joy. She let go of his other hand and he wobbled ever so slightly, then picked up his other foot and stepped again in my directions. A tear welled up in my eye and I opened my arms again. ""Come on, buddy! Come to daddy!"" He smiled wide and picked up his foot again, placing it towards me once more. But here he faltered, wobbled, and fell to his butt. He giggled, I laughed with joy and my wife gathered him up for a hug. It was the first best day of my life.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WX6226F
