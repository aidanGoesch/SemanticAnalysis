She always sends me and my kids snacks and cakes. She is the best grandmother these kids will ever have. Ive known her for about ten years. Sadly I have watched her heath deteriorate. I have recently been watching her. About four weeks ago I saw her. Her dementia has slowly taken her happiness away. Some days it looks like she is not even awake. She is like a wondering shell. I am now very worried that she'll forget who all of us are. This disease is very scary. It takes its toll on us. I can't imagine how she feels inside her mind. I hope one day there will be a cure for this awful disease.,,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WX6J620
