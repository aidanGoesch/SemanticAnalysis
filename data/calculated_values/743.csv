My husband and I wanted to go visit his parents in other states.  He had been to visit a couple of years ago, I have not been in probably 15 years.  Circumstances just did not allow me to go sooner.  We flew to Arizona to first go and visit his mother.  She had been having memory problems for a few years and had lived at home until recently.  This last year she could not even receive a phone call as she could not remember to speak into the phone.  We arrived and went to see her in a nursing home, assisted living.  She was so happy to see her son, but she did not know his name.  She looked at me a couple of times like she thought she should know me but she didn't.  I thought that was okay as I knew her.  She was always the sweetest lady I knew and it was so sad to see her lose her memories that way.  She had taught school her whole life, but all the information she knew was leaving quickly.  Even beyond that situation was the fact that no one had been to check on her.  I went in her room to see what she needed and found almost nothing.  We resupplied her before we left.  I also had brought her a lovely bed doll ( doll sits on your bed and looks cute).  It brought some color to her room.  I hoped when we left this doll might help her to just be happy.  This trip was one of the saddest I had been on.  A beautiful lifetime of memories just gone.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WX6J620
