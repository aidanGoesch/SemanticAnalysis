One thing led to another, and she called me a narcissist. This lead to another fight because I disagreed with her opinion. I think my girlfriend is being unfair and not very supportive of me. She thinks all I talk about is myself. I'm going through a rough patch right now. I need support. I'll I want is for her to sympathize with me. I just lost my job. It's making me depressed. I don't feel that I am asking too much of her. Maybe I should end this relationship. I found out my girlfriend's true nature. I'm just glad I found it so early on in our relationship.
