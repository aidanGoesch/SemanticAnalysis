This was a birthday party for my fiance. I don't always use themes but wanted to do something different. I thought a Hawaiian theme would be prefect. I rented a hall out since there was going to be a mixture of family and friends and lots of noise with the music playing. The decorations were set up perfectly as you would imagine. We also had drink and appetizers. The night started off right as more people showed up then expected. We danced, played a few games and socialized. The biggest surprise had to be a couple of cousins that we have not seen in a while showed up. I had planned this as another surprise. When they showed up we really begin to party. Catching up and talking led us to not want the night to end. The hall was only rented for a few hours so when it was time to go we had the after party at our house. This is when the night really took off. We started drinking more alcohol and things got crazy. Nothing bad happen it was all positive energy, but a room full of drunk people is always full of laughs if the energy is right. I can recall a soul train line that we did, and that went on for a long time. That had to be one of the many highlight of this night. It left us something to talk about for a long time.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8Q2GQWIZ,
