Everyone ended up being alright, but it was pretty terrifying at the time.  It happened at night near the mall a few blocks from where I live.  We had just seen a movie and were coming back to my house when we were hit out of nowhere.  The driver of the other car got out and was visibly intoxicated.  He seemed very nervous and wanting to get out of there before the cops arrived.  There were some cops right down the street so it didn't take them long to arrive.  They asked a few questions and took a few pictures.  I saw in the distance that they were giving the other driver a field sobriety test.  After that, I just remember seeing them put the other driver in handcuffs and loading him into the back of a cruiser.  It actually ended up being a bit fortuitous, in that we received a decent payout from the other driver's insurance, most likely because he had been intoxicated.  Neither of us have any lasting injuries.  I had a little soreness in my neck for a few days, but the doctor said it was just some minor whiplash.  I actually haven't even thought about it since the last time I did the essay, since there really wasn't any lasting consequences.  The car was totaled out, but still drives fine (in fact, it was already totaled out before that due to some hail damage on the body).  I'm just relieved that nobody was hurt and it wasn't more severe.",30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1WIE0XV,
