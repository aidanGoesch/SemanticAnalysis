I have been avoiding thinking about Jane and what happened for 4 months now. May be it was regret? Shame? Guilt? I don't know. But it is important i reflect back on it. I think i owe it to myself, and more importantly my future self. I knew that l was attracted to Sharon right after the day i met her. But i was in love with Jane. God, i loved her so much. But as they say, they heart wants what the heart wants, right?  That awful night when i decided to have a few too many drinks and go to Sharon's apartment. May be i wouldn't have done it had i been sober. I had to come clean, so i confessed to Jane.  I knew she could never forgive. She deserves much better than me. I truly wish her well..",,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48IWN
