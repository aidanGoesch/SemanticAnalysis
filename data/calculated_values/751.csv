I broke up with my first girlfriend of almost four years. It was a traumatic experience, one that I keep thinking back to and realizing that I have grown a lot since then but that also things will never be the same again. I often catch myself thinking where things went wrong, specifically, why I did what I did. While we were long distance for a few months, I went to see an escort. When we met up again, I was quite distraught and eventually couldn't shoulder what I did. I went online to find what others have done in a similar situation and one night, I was driven to confess thinking it would rid my guilty conscience and that if we were to have a successful relationship, it had to start over somehow. I told her what I did and I only remember how disappointed she was. She only cried a little bit and before the week was over, we had broken up. She realized I was made immature decisions and hoped that maybe if we met again in New York, we could get back together again. On hindsight, maybe she was letting me down easy. For the first month after the break up, I was extremely stressed. I would go to sleep at around 4AM and wake up at around 1PM. I felt like I lost a part of me. We had spent a lot of time together over the four years, almost every living minute. But we both realized we couldn't be together given what had happened. So I spent a lot of time trying to bury what happened. I was completely unsure of why I did what I did and the most shocking thing was that how unexpected everything was. Yet, everything came crashing down in the span of a week. I lost a lot of hair in the following few months after this, a condition called telogen effluvium, diagnosed by doctors. Still now, I feel like I don't understand my actions and by extension, myself.",,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48IWN
