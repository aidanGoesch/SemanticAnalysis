He invited me.  There was only one problem.  He said it was in another country.  It was in Spain.  I had never been to Spain before.  I was a little nervous.  I thought that I wouldn't fit in.  I thought that I would be the only one there who spoke English.  I couldn't believe how wrong I was.  When I got there I had a wonderful time.  The food was absolutely delicious.  The wedding was a beautiful ceremony.  There were plenty of people who spoke English.  These people showed me how amazing Spain was.  After the wedding I was shown the beautiful landmarks of the country.,,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48WI1
