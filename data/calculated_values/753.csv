Ubeda is a little town in the South of Spain. I had been to Spain before, but never to to the South. I didn't know much about the culture in small towns either. Nothing could have prepared me for what I saw. The city was gorgeous and full of history. There were small bustling streets, people enjoying a drink on terraces, olive trees fields everywhere. Through my friend, I was also able to take a tour of the city and discover it was full of history and had a critical role in shaping the culture of Spain. I really had no expectations and was really surprised. Not only were the people friendly, but the food was also amazing and the setting beautiful as well. This changed my perspective on the south of Spain as well as my perspective of little towns too. I really can't wait to get back to Ubeda as well as explore more the surroundings of the town as well. This trip had a transformational impact on me. I have since then gotten more involved into the Spanish culture, learning more the language and the traditions of the country. I really hope to be able to go back early next year.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QA48WI1,
