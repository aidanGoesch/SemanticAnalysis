Before three months, My wife and me went to California for official purpose. That day is my wife's birthday. we stayed in a hotel in Los Angeles. So we were ready to leave from hotel. Because we had to reach airport within one hour. From morning my wife expected birthday wishes from his mouth. But I just add phone call to my boss office things. MY wife's expectation slightly started to change as angry. But I just ignored that. We reached airport within correct time. When I started some words to my wife, she started to happy. But I made conversation on other things. So she was disappointed on me. after few hours  of travel we just reached our Redmond city. She completely changed as devil. After reaching our home I ordered him to open home. She opened the door. She was shocked and surprised. Because my relatives ,friends, neighbours were crowded in my home. there is a strawberry cake was in middle of the crowd. the hall was well decorated. I just said"" Happy birthday to you my dearest lady"" .She was started to cry. I tried to convince him. She was cut the cake, After celebration, I personally gifted a diamond ring as birthday gift",,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QLO8WIG
