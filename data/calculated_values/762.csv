This is defined as Atrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. I also had liver problems. This diagnosis scared me very much and so I immediate began reading all the information I could and watching videos about the subject and immediately began making the necessary changes to my diet and lifestyle in attempt to reverse these symptoms I started exercising on a regular basis and improved my diet and when I went back the doctor the tests showed improvement in a short time and I was told to keep working at these changes and being consistent and so I did. I continued eating healthy and exercising on a regular basic and returned to the doctor every few weeks to check my progress and each and every time they said I am improving and to keep up the good work. I went home feeling hopeful. I then continued reading as much as I could and changed my diet to a much healthier almost 100% plant based with a few eggs from dads on occasion and Ive ordered some foods that I am unable to get at my local grocery store. I think the variety of foods is helping me and certainly the exercise I am getting is helping me feel more refreshed and I feel that I am in better physical shape than before I was diagnosed. This has changed my life and given me new hope. I have learned to eat different foods that I had not eaten before. This has changed my life and I feel younger than before. I have been discussing these changes with my doctor and with family and now several members of my family are asking me for recipes. We also plan on working together to grow more food this year as this will give us exercise and supply us with fresh foods. I have also located a CSA that I plan on joining as they deliver fresh food weekly from their farm in a large box. I also have been visiting the farmers market and have worked out a deal with a local grower to help them on their farm during the growing season in exchange for food and money.",,34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1FWIY5J
