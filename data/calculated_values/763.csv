Spending 4 days in the hospital was hard and scary, and I would prefer not having to do it again.  I have seen several doctors since getting out of the hospital, and have followed all of their instructions, taken my meds as prescribed, been to all my appointments and have tried to become much healthier.  Besides taking meds now, I have completely quit drinking alcohol, eat a lot better, and get more exercise.  I have lost close to 50lbs so far, and still have more to go.  I have a procedure on my heart that I need to get done as soon as I can get health insurance, which is my biggest hurdle at the moment.  I feel so much better than did a year ago, like a new man, and am dedicated to getting healthier and adding years to my life.  This was all very scary and shocking and I dont ever want to go through it again.  I have a lot of regret for living the lifestyle I lived in the past, and am making serious effort to live a better life.  For me, for my wife, and for our two daughters.  Ive completely changed my diet.  I have bought some exercise equipment and work out daily.  I am truly trying to get healthier and stronger.  I feel better now than I have in several years.  I never want to go through something like this, and I never want to put my family through something like this again.  It was all very confusing, embarassing, and scary.",34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1FWIY5J,
