I was admitted with heart and liver problems.  I found out I have liver damage, and Atrial Fibrilation (A-fib).  I was in the ICU for 4 days.  It was scary, and has completely changed my life.  My wife and daughters came and stayed with me most of the time.  The did a lot of test on me, and took a lot of blood.  I wasn't afraid of dying right then, but was afraid of dying later.  The doctors really put my mind at ease and help me not be afraid.  After I was released from the hospital I began treatment with medicines, and started getting in much better shape.  I have quit drinking, started exercising, and have lost 50 pounds.  There is a lot more to do, like more medicines and possibly some procedures to my heart.  I will deal with those as they come.  I feel so much better, and continue to follow my doctors orders and am looking forward to a long, healthier life.  I'm not ready to die yet.",34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1FWIY5J,34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1FWIY5J
