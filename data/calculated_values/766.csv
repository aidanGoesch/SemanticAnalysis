Brownie is my pet puppy, she is almost 6 months old now. I got her when she was 3 months old. I was feeling a bit down and depressed since my move to the new workplace. New settings, new people. It was quite lonely. I always felt a bit scared to get another dog. This fear began since my childhood dog scooby passed away. I didn't think i could tolerate such a loss again. However, it was time. She is chocolate brown color. German shepard breed. The sweetest dog on the planet if you ask me. Ever since she stepped into my apartment and life, joy is plentiful. I love her.",,34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1HDKY5L
