I have always driven a full size pick-up truck and due to my commute to work decided that it was time to downsize and buy a more compact car. I have long wanted a 4 door Audi A3. The style and overall design really attracted me the the Audi line. With a strong financial income and little to no debt I thought that it was time for me to make my dream purchase. I went to my local Audi dealership two weeks before vacation with high hopes of driving away in my dream car. Two dealerships later and a whole lot of negotiating I was given the deal that worked for me and was able to drive away in my brand new Audi A3. 	It was a cold April night when I finally completed signing my life away and was handed over the keys to my new car. I will never forget the smell of that black and grey leather interior. Also, the feeling of the heated leather seats! Due to the weather that night and how late it was I decided to head home and wait until the next day to go for a nice long ride. I left my house the following day after admiring the exterior of the car and how good it looked parked in front of my house and headed straight for the beach. I know, surprising right? Heading to the beach on a cold April day? Yes! To this day I enjoy my rides to work just a little bit more each day thanks to my beautiful Audi A3. The added bonus is the gas mileage that I get with this car! I would highly recommend this compact sporty vehicle to anyone in the market. Thank you Audi; you have earned yourself a lifelong customer! This was the most positive memorable event that has happened to me over the last few months!",,34HJIJKLP6ICAXEMPBAGYNFT90O4VO
