I am extremely worried about how I am going to make ends meet in the coming months. The city is so expensive to live in and my savings is draining considerably. Job hunting itself feels as though it's a job of its own. Not just a job, but it feels like a full time job. I have to spend most of my waking hours hunting down leads and it bums me out even further because it just feels like im spinning my wheels. The job felt like such a big part of my life, I had been there for 5 years afterall. Making health adjustments to my lifestyle after all these  years is proving difficult. What do you do when your entire life revolved around working at the corporation? Most of my friends are people I've met at the corporation. I hope they will still want to hang out with me even though i'll be seeing much less of them. I must figure out a new way forward. Find a job that I won't hate, find something to get passionate about. Perhaps it's time for a new career. I've been looking into maybe going back to school but I don't know if that's possible right now. I will get back on the job hunt first thing tomorrow. I hope it is a fruitful endeavor. I really miss how things have been. I got comfortable. It was nice while it lasted.",,34HJIJKLP6ICAXEMPBAGYNFTZ0NV44
