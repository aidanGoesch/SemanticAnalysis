It had been going on for a little while. I tried many things to try to make myself feel better. I needed a change to try to make myself feel better. I decided to go get a dog. I knew that growing up I had a dog that I loved and it always made me feel better. I made the decision to go and get a puppy. When I went to adopt a puppy, I saw one that looked very similar to one I had growing up. I knew it was one that I needed to get. On the spot I did the paper work and took that puppy home with me. Almost immediately once I saw the puppy I fell in love with it. The puppy was very cute and happy. Everything in my daily life changed after that moment I got the puppy. A lot of the stress in my life went away because I was a lot happier. It became one of the most important decision in my life thus far.",34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4DK1IQI,
