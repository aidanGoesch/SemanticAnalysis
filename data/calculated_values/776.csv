When I was growing up I've had a dog that was my best friend. My dog passed away a few years ago and I became very depressed and my life really slowed down. A couple of months ago I decided it was time to get a new dog to see if it will help my depression. I went to the animal shelter to see if I could adopt a puppy. When I got there, there weren't that many left but I saw one that looked like the dog I had growing up. I immediately fell in love with that dog and knew it was the one I wanted and needed. From the very first day I took him home it made my mood so much better. It has made me so happy and I'm so glad I made that decision. I spend pretty much all day with that dog besides when I'm at work. When I go out anywhere I take him with me. It started hanging out with my friends more and being more social as well. Whenever I'm feeling stressed or depressed I would go take him to the park and it would make me feel better. We go out on walks a lot so I'm also getting more exercise as well. He's going to be my best friend for a very long time.",34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4DK1IQI,34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4DK1IQI
