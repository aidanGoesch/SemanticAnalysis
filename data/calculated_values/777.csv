I started feeling chest pains daily but never really paid any attention to it. I would come home and eat dinner with my family and talk to them about it. I went to a doctor but they didn't see anything. I went out running one day, and my chest started hurting really bad. I started grasping it onto my chest and I called 911. They reported to my location almost immediately. I was able to call my family, but I couldn't speak so they couldn't get told til a paramedic arrived. They hauled me to the hospital where they luckily got me taken care of. My whole family was there which made the process a lot better. I wasn't able to go to work and help my family out with that, but thankfully we had savings. It was a terrible feeling. I will always get myself checked by multiple doctors now. Thank you God for being alive still.",,34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4M3AQIA
