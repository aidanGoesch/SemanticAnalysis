I knew this was necessary to completely reset my immune system and also to improve my mindset and bring me back down to earth. My drinking and eating habits had been spinning out of control and experience has taught me that this was the best solution. I succeed for 11 days! Very proud of myself, I tried to ease my way back into some semblance of a life. One morning I woke up so restless and energetic that I decided it was time to revisit one of my favorite haunts: a place called Town Square. There I knew that I could get a quality lunch with good company and a nice glass of rose wine. I also needed to do some shopping and figured I could grab a snack and catch a movie; something I hadn't done in a long time. The problem arose, however, as soon as I arrived. Suffering already from fatigued having had to wait in the increasing heat for a bus, shopping was a bit difficult. I found respite in the changing rooms. I was able to purchase the items I wanted, however, and proceeded to the bar to dine! Two lovely fish tacos, the special of the day which included the glass of wine all for only $12. I was very proud of myself. But here I hesitated. I knew that eating would make me tired and thought maybe I should just Uber it home and catch a movie online somewhere. But no, stubborn me persisted in going to the movie theater. The heat was vicious by this early afternoon hour. I barely was able to drag myself to the theater and certainly some people thought I was drunk! How embarrassing! I finally had to call a friend to come pick me up. Four hours later I made it home. What a horrible day....",,34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4NR7QIK
