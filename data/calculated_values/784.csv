I saw an ad for some detox tea on the tv and decided to order it. It took a couple days to get here and I was really worried that I was just wasting my time and money. Still my curiosity got the best of me and I decided to try it. It tasted awful, like seriously, the worst thing I have ever purposely drank. At first I really didn't see anything happening, other than excessive use of the bathroom. But after two or three days and around ten pound of bad stuff being removed from my body I began to believe it was actually working. It worked really well for like two weeks, and then it wasn't really doing anything anymore. This kind of disappointed me but I was determined to keep going, and keep getting my body healthier. So a month ago I started a different way, I started getting more sun, and eating more raw foods. I went on walks, and just tried to let my body detoxify as naturally as possible.  It helped a lot, After a week or so of that I began to lose weight and could feel myself becoming stronger. It has been a wild ride. From things I never thought about to becoming a crazy important part of my life. But I am happy that It has because I don't think i could be the person I am today without this journey.",,34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N
