I started taking i because I learned that this naturally occuring compound is purported to be a highly beneficial compound with trong anti-oxidant and detoxification-supporting properties. The supplement is also used to support liver function and help alleviate neuropathy.  Upon taking recommended a dosage, I developed back pain. As a scientist, I began scouring medical literature as well as watching biomedical presentations. I began a intellectual journey in learning about the body's mechanisms for detoxification. One of the most important scientists to help educate me in this area was Dr. Christopher Shade, CEO of Quicksilver Scientific (a company that specializes in biological testing of toxins and supply of carefully formulated nutriceuticals designed to help promote detoxification.  Through Dr. Shade, I bean to understand the body;s complex and intricately choreographed mechanisms for identifying, tagging, mobilizing, and eliminating toxins from the body. In addition, I learned about environmental factors that could lead to a block in detoxification. In my case, my medical history and symptomology supported a block in detoxification created by a significant exposure to toxic mold. As it turns out, mold biotoxins can block the body's ability to clear a number of toxins, including heavy metals, and that without removal of this block, use of other methods that stimulate portions of the detox process (such as alpha lipoic acid), may be hindered.  This can put undue stress on the liver and kidneys.  Fortunately, Dr. Shade also was instrumental in recommending a simple dietary remedy to this mold toxin-induced block to detoxification. After a very short amount of time, my troubles were greatly diminished. I am grateful to Dr. Shade for his knowledge  and insight, which has enabled me to proceed in a lifestyle of detoxification as well as identify mold biotoxin as a source of many of my chronic health issues.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N,34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N
