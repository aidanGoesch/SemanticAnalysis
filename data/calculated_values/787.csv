It's crazy because the same can be said for my friend Megan. Megan and I went to college together and lived in the same apartment complex for three years. We have always been close but never really spoke of being interested in each other romantically. It's funny but we just never seemed to be single at the same time. Then one night we were out with another friend at a bar together and joked about how we should just give up looking for a partner and date each other. It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads. Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together. We hit it off perfectly. We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense. We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other. This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends. Most of them will think we are crazy too. But sometimes that can be inevitable with a big group of friends like we have. I know right now that Megan and I seem like a perfect match. Hopefully we will last and can continue to have fun together, regardless of what our friends say.",,34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7VK43Z
