She's an old girlfriend of mine. And I'm sponsoring her in a twelve-step program. Getting romantically involved is very taboo in a twelve-step program, especially among sponsors and sponsees. But she came to visit me. We hadn't seen each other face-to-face in years. When she showed up, we immediately started flirting. We went out to eat that night. She ended up staying the night. We became romantically involved even though both of us sort of knew better. But we've been doing great since. We decided that we wanted to get closer. It was worth the risk, we both agreed. I must admit, the ""wrong"" nature of what we did sort of made it more appealing. I think she would agree with that.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7VK43Z,34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7VK43Z
