I was supposed to be in charge of the church we attended and she told me she was giving up authority to me. I don't trust anyone so I had my doubts, but in less than a week she started showing her true colors. She organized a meeting without my consent or even knowledge. I later told her I didn't approve but she didn't care. I was frustrated. She was deviating from everything she had told me and what she was supposed to believe in. I had to take it in stride and try to make it through each day. Survive each day really. A month ago she tried to corner me publicly and fully go back on our agreement that brought me down here. She told me she wasn't going to give me any more money in public hoping to pressure me to agree or look like the bad guy. She was the one who ended up looking like a fool. Previously I had told her that she didn't have to give me any money on two occassions, and in front of everyone I made this known. I also told her that I didn't want her money and that I resented being treated like someone trying to take advantage. This lady is a bad person whoever and none of this phased her. She was just happy she got what she wanted, she didn't care about me or how I felt. I plan on leaving as soon as I can and then we'll see who is laughing last.",,34Q075JO1YZFPXGNZW3PFWI03G2018
