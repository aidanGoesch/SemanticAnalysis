We got up at 5 am and went to the airport anyway and found out that several flights for our airline had been canceled due to hail damage to the plane. The line to re-book at the airline counter was extremely long and workers suggested we re-book on our own. When I went online to check out alternate flights home, I saw that we could not fly out on the same airline till two days later. My mother and I do not have the greatest relationship so I was very eager to get home and away from her. I found the prospect of two more days with her very frustrating. I also needed to be back in town for work. I was extremely frustrated and anxious trying to decide what to do. My mother does not know how to book flights or use travel sites so I re-booked us on a much more expensive flight from another airline. I felt extremely stressed about the cost but I knew I needed to get back ASAP. The flight I booked ended up being $515 a person, compared to the original $100 a person. I put all of the tickets on my credit card because I know my mom has bad credit and also would have to carry over a balance for a few months to pay it off. I really hated having all of that on my card and feared I would never be reimbursed. The flight I booked also required us to wait in the airport for 7 hours. I have a pretty intense fear of flying, so the anticipation was also distressing. Overall it was a very distressing experience and it made me not want to travel for a while.",34Q075JO1YZFPXGNZW3PFWI0SXM01F,34Q075JO1YZFPXGNZW3PFWI0SXM01F
