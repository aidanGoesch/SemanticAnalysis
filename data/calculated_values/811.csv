We had stopped at an outside bar to enjoy a few drinks and maybe grab something to eat. My dad and mom ordered some cocktails and I ordered a beer and a burger. The bartender gave us our drinks and we were talking about the flight down and how nice the hotel we were staying at was, you know, the things you talk about when you arrive in a new place for vacation. After a few minutes, my hamburger came out, but I didn't really feel like eating it. My stomach kind of hurt and I mentioned it to my mom and she said her stomach was upset, too. At this point my dad felt fine and he ordered another drink. He got about two sips in and felt ill as well. I finished my beer and we paid for the drinks and left the bar. As we were walking down the street, I had to run into the alley to get sick to my stomach. A short time later, my mother and father did the same. We were feeling pretty poorly and we weren't sure if we would be able to make it back to the hotel. I flagged down a cab and asked if they could take us back to the hotel. I explained what had happened, and the taxi driver started to chuckle. he said that bar was infamous for drugging their customers and then having one of the employees offer to drive them to the hospital for treatment and then either charging them a huge amount of money or robbing them outright. My heart skipped a beat as I thought this was going to be the part where the taxi driver robbed us. Much to my delight, he took us back to the hotel and just charged us he regular cab fare. I thanked him and we made it up to the room, where we were sick all night. We finally got some sleep after several hours of being sick. I woke up first and got out of bed and realized I felt fine. I had no signs of any illness. My head felt fine and my stomach was alright. Both my parents woke up and they were alright, too. We were all thankful that it was nothing serious and we all felt better. We made certain to steer clear of that bar for the rest of our vacation!",,34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVCKPLH4
