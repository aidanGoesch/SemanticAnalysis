We went to an outside bar. They slipped something into our drinks. I only had one drink and was completely obliterated, as was my boyfriend and his mom. We lost time, and blacked out at some points. Luckily we were together with others that did not get sick. We were back to normal with no hangover or loss of appetite by the middle of the night. I never have blacked out or lost time, even when I have been drinking triple that amount. I am glad that our grandmother only had a couple sips from one of our drinks because she's 87. She definitely could have died. We saw a couple other people that were sick as well. They were sitting down with their heads between their knees outside the ship. I heard people  in other countries get people sick on purpose so they can take you to their hospital. Then they expect compensations for saving your life. Even though they were the one's who got you sick in the first place.",34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVCKPLH4,
