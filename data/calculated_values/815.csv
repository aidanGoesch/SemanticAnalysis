Im getting myself together and making sure all the lights and oven is off. Then I leave for the day. While at work I realize that I left our dog Peanut outside. So I end up leaving work for a long break. And head home to put Peanut back in the house. I arrived home and he was gone, dug a hole under fence. So I was horrified. Well 3 weeks passed and my dughter said she saw Peanut in a yard near school. So we left to find him. We arrived at the house and sure enogh that was Peanut. He was jumping all around, happy to see us. A man came out. I said this is my dog, I am taking him home. The man said no, and he called the police. The police arrived, I showed them the missing poster, and pics on my phone and the ad that was in the paper. The police officer said take your dog.",34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVE9KHLB,
