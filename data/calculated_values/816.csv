My husband and I looked everywhere. We walked up and down many streets. Drove to different neighborhoods. But no sign of Peanut. It was horrible and distressing. Our daughter was so sad that, she could'nt even function in school. This affected all of us very deeply. Peanut was our bestfriend of 10 years. Then one day our daughter came home and told me that she had seen Peanut in a yard near her school. So we went there, and sure enough it was Peanut. He yelped and jumped up and down, he was so glad to see us. We knocked on the door of the mobile home. A man answered the door. The man there said he had dog for years. He told us to leave the property or he was going to call the police I said good, I hope you call them. When police arrived, one officer talked to us and the other talked to the man. I showed the officer pictures of Peanut on my phone, the ad I had posted in the lost and found in the local newspaper, and the flyers that I have printed and posted all over town. Both the officers talked among themselves. Then they talked to us. They said since the man does,nt have any proof of a vet bill, no pictures, no anything to prove otherwise, they said take your dog home and make sure he can't get loose again. I was happy with tears and my daughter was so happy, because the whole time Peanut was so excited to see us, it was obvious, he was our dog.",34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVE9KHLB,34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVE9KHLB
