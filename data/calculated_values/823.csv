I did this right when I graduated. I returned a couple years later looking for a job. I felt at home after reconnecting with friends. We had a great time going to my favorite pizza place. I got a large meat lovers. They got a cheese pizza. They paid for the bill. I was very thankful. Later that night, we went to the bar. I sung some karaoke. It was a fun time. I almost threw up from drinking. They helped me get a job. It took a few weeks, but I got a job at a accountant's office. It paid decently with great perks. I loved the workplace. This city is treating me well.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN6IXNYF
