It had been quite a bit of time since I had gone anywhere. I ended up trying to decide where I wanted to go. Colorado sounded nice. I had never been there before. I booked a trip to Rocky Mountain National Park. It was a quick plane flight there but the drive to the actual park took quite a while. When I got there I couldn't believe how beautiful it was. Majestic was the only way to describe the land in this area. So many beautiful sights to see. After spending sometime there I decided to go white water rafting. I packed up my gear. We headed over to the nearby town of Idaho Spring, Colorado. It is a great place. I loved riding the rapids there. I had so much fun.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI
