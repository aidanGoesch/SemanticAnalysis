It's been a long emotional struggle over the last couple months and the last week for sure. It has come to fruition and my girlfriend in not happy about it. I know it's the right thing to do. I had to protect the kids, I just didn't trust the living situation. But, it has come at a cost with girlfriend and me. She is very emotional about it, lot's of outbursts, getting mad at me. She has been trying to tear down the kids a bit and really doesn't like my son. But, deep down I know it was right, the kids are happy. And I'm excited to get our lives back on track. I'm not sure what will happen with girlfriend and me, but we are trying to work it out. girlfriend is coming around a little bit and I think deep down, she knows this needed to happen. I think she will become even more comfortable with the situation. I feel bad for her, she has so much to process. With her first it's always a struggle and I think her last is just running roughshod over her. The actual move was excruciating! I'm tired, my knees and back hurt and I'm exhausted. It was a week of stairs, boxes, trucks and pain. I hate moving.",30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPNE0HQQ,30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPNE0HQQ
