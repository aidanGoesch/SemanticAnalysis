After so much anxiety and curiosity the doctor came telling me that I needed to be calm as I'm going to be alright. I was still not settled because nobody wants to die of course. The doctor ran a test on me and said I haven't been resting enough indicating that I need to start eating more fruits and resting well enough. I became relaxed a bit. ""I thought I was going to die "" I said soliloquizing No! You won't said the doctor, you just need to rest more and take the pills I'm going to give to you. For 3 months now,I've been super great because I've stopped being languid. I've also been taking my pills as instructed by the doctor. Life without stress is almost impossible in relation to my source of livelihood. Being an event planner can really be stressful you know but I must say I've really been living my best life avoiding stress. My advice to everyone out there is to try avoid stressing themselves as it's unfriendly to our health. Eat well,sleep appropriately, most importantly rest well. I've been happy. I've been glad. I am fulfilled.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YMYND
