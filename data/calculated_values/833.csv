I had never experienced something like that before. I was terrified that something was wrong. I wanted to try sleeping through it but the pain only got worse. I ended up getting a ride to the emergency room. The wait was extremely long and frustrating. I was sitting in a chair in the waiting room and had nothing else to do. I ended up finally meeting with a nursing assistant which made me feel slightly relieved. After that. there was another long and frustrating wait. A nurse arrived and ordered some tests. I watched some TV and then had a CT scan. While waiting for the results, I was very worried and could not stand the anticipation. The doctor arrived and told me she was consulting with the radiologist which scared me. I was unaware that that was just standard procedure. She told me that I had kidney stones and she would give me medication to shrink it. I felt so much better.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YMYND,
