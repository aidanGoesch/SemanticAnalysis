I thought it was just normal wear and tear until the pain got worse in the afternoon. It was so sharp and felt like something was squeezing on my insides. It no longer seemed like it was routine back pain so I decided to go to the emergency room. It took forever for someone to see me, and I was worried because the pain continued. A nurse came in to see me, asked what my symptoms were, and then told me I would need to undergo some tests. I waited some more hours before the big scanning machine was available. The scan was painless, and after I was done, I went to use the bathroom since I was told the doctor would come talk to me soon. I immediately felt the pain disappear after using the bathroom. When I was waiting for the doctor, a nurse came in the room and told me the doctor would be in shortly, she was just on the phone with the radiologist. I immediately felt panic set in. Why would she be talking to a radiologist? I thought the worst and believed that I must have had something very seriously wrong with me. I started to think of all of the things I was going to miss out in life, and felt extremely sad and hopeless. When the doctor arrived, she didn't have a gloomy expression on her face, so I felt hopeful. She said that I had kidney stones. I immediately felt better, even though kidney stones are serious. I didn't know that radiologists look over all the scans the machine does. I thought they only got involved if it was a very serious disease. I told her that I felt better after using the bathroom, and she said that it was possible I already passed the kidney stone. Just to be sure, she gave me medications to shrink any stones and to help heal quicker. I was so relieved after that. I felt like I had a new lease on life, and decided to commit myself to eating healthier and drinking much more water.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YMYND,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YMYND
