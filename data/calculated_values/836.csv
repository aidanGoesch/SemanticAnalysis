We got on our seats and it definitely was not what I expected. The pedals were easy enough to turn but it felt like we were all dying about five minutes in. The Bride to be seemed to be having a great time so no one complained. I was definitely not expecting to pedal around on a little villa that we had to pedal to get around on. The bridesmaids all seemed to be in such great spirits. We got to our first stop in about twenty minutes and we got to peruse the bars in that particular area for about 30 mins. I actually enjoyed the stops more because the seats on the buggy were definitely not the most comfortable. Everyone had a good time for the most part. At the last stop we ended up going into one bar and toasting to the bride. Some guys in a bachelor party actually bought us drinks. That was our mistake. A few of the girls started feeling a little light headed and woozy. We ended up having to get a few ubers to carry us all back to the maid of honors house because two of the girls couldn't walk. We got the girls to bed and kept a super close watch on them. When they woke up the next morning they didn't remember what happened. We didn't realize until the next morning that they were given something in their drinks. We made sure and called and made a report. The police said that they would monitor the videos in the bar but we never heard anything out of it.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN906NYR
