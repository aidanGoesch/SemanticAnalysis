I was so surprised, I really had no idea he had even been working on it. WHen he rode it up the driveway I was literally in shock! He hopped off, and told me to jump on. The best part was when I straddled the bike and twisted the throttle... it was so loud and felt overwhelmingly powerful! I was completely exhilarated! I think this was probably the most surprising birthday present I have ever received in my entire life. I was totally blindsided, and felt such love and gratitude to my husband at that moment. We have had a rough couple of years in our marriage, and he hasn't been the most supportive husband during that time. Knowing that he took the time and energy to build that bike for me, really made me feel loved by him, and definitely went a long way in making up for some of the negative things that have happened between us. I would have to say that this act of kindness and devotion went a long way in making me feel more secure in his feelings for me and our future together in general. I know one thing is for sure, it will be very hard for him (or anyone), to ever top this surprise birthday gift. I really am still in shock over it months later. Unfortunately it's getting too cold to ride now, but I can still go out to the garage and see my bike and feel the overwhelming sense of pride I have for owning such a beautiful machine, and knowing that I have a husband who truly loves me very much. His birthday is coming up, so I have to put in a lot of effort to try and make his birthday wonderful also.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN90ZNYK,
