He was in the army in Marocco. I was in Germany as part of a university exchange student in the University of Gottingen. It was cold and raining in Germany, and   Christmas was approaching. I decided to go to the south of Spain, where it was expected to be warm and sunny. I was on the train going south, and there he was — a handsome, quiet military guy sitting on the train. We started to talk, and the conversation went on for hours until the train arrived at its final destination, Granada. It was beautiful and sunny. He had to Marocco; I was to stay in Granada. I gave him my address and phone number in Colorado. It took a couple of months. I was back in Colorado, but he finally called me. We were in love. He came to Colorado with a 90-day fiancé visa. We wanted to get married at Christmas, and we wanted to be sunny just like it was in Granada. We got married on Christmas day. It was a freezing day, and it rain after the ceremony, but it didn’t matter because we were madly in love.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPNIUJYNC
