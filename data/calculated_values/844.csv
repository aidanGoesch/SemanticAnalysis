They send countless winters and its were her late husband's ashes were spread as well. We figured what better way to continue that relationship that they had. They always were together and were travelers of the world. For some reason unknown to us that where they always chose to be in the winters. They would rent a cabin in the mountains and stay there for months at the time after their retirement. Seems like they chose that spot to rest so we figured what better spot to rest for eternity.    As we hiked up the mountain we told countless stories about her life. One of my favorites was when i first met her. She though i was a handy man and started telling me all the work that needed to be done around my then girlfriends house. My spouse told her that she was having a handyman come over and so she then relayed all the work that my spouse needed. I at the time was surprising my girlfriend at her house not realizing she would be there. Confused i started following her and listened to the work that i was being ordered to do. When my wife got back from the store she found me fixing the sink. After realizing what had happened my wife and mother in law never let me off the hook. It whats always brought up on Christmas dinners.,,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPNIVIYND
