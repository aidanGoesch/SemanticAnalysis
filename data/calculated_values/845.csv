We hiked up a trail in the Colorado National Monument, near Grand Junction Colorado, to one of her favorite spots to visit.  It took about half an hour to get there.  It was my first time going, but my wife and kids had gone before when my mother in law was not sick.  When we got to the spot, a large cliff overlooking the area, we took a few minutes to look around and enjoy the scenery.  Then we found a small juniper tree that sat near the edge, and my father in law spread the ashes around the base.  My kids hung up some trinkets they had brought that reminded them of their grandma, and everyone had brought a stone from her collection to stack on the spot.  After we had done this, my father in law sat down and started crying.  It was hard to watch, as he had never displayed that kind of emotion around me before.  My older daughter sat down next to him and they just sat there for a while and looked out on the valley ahead of them.  She was the most in tune with her grandfather of all the grandchildren.  She was the oldest, and had recently spent several months living with her grandparents, and had really grown to be close with them. After they had sat for a while and came to terms with the moment, we went to one of my mother in law's favorite mexican restaurants to have dinner.  We all talked about the memories we had of her, and her personality traits that stood out.  My wife had a peach margarita in her honor, as that was one of her favorite drinks.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPNIVIYND
