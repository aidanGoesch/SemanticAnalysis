Last weekend we were having a BBQ with some of our friends at our new house. I think they started fighting over a bone or something, but my big dog attacked our smaller dog in the yard and cut him up pretty good. A couple of my friends had to rush in to break them apart. The poor little guy needed 13 stitches and has a limp now. Our big dog, Brutus, has shown some aggressive tendencies before, but this was something else. My husband is pretty frustrated and unsure about what to do. I called a local training place that specializes in aggressive dogs like Brutus, and they suggested giving him anti-depressants for the time being. He is scheduled to stay there for an extended time starting on Monday. I'm worried because when I met with the head specialist they indicated that Brutus might have to be put down if he cannot control his aggression. This would absolutely break my heart if it ends up happening. I know my husband would really struggle too since Brutus was his dog from before we met and moved in together. He's taking it pretty hard already. We just have to cross our fingers and hope Brutus can learn how to be a bit more chill in the future. I don't think we could stomach having our dogs fighting that badly again. Hopefully it can all work out for the best.",,34T446B1C10ZC0QLFTS9WS1RXHS0CV
