There is a terminal patient who I just adore named Kara. I make sure to go and visit her every week on one of my lunch breaks. Three weeks ago Kara gave me a card and a little toy angel to tell me how much I mean to her. Even though I see her often, this really brought a tear to my eye at the time. Of all the terminal patients that I see, Kara is truly the most optimistic. It's so hard to put myself in her shoes. But I know for a fact that she's one of the bravest people I know. It's inspiring to talk with her and hear her positive outlook on various things in life. Though it's inevitable that Kara will no longer be a part of my life in a few years, I cherish the time that we can spend together. That's why this card was so meaningful. It showed that she feels exactly the same way about our friendship. Kara doesn't always get a ton of visitors due to her age, so it's a bit sad when other patients have large gatherings of families to see them. That's why I'm so glad that I've scheduled a big pizza party for her next week when I visit. Hopefully I can return the favor of her nice card and gift by giving her a day of fun and pizza!",,34V1S5K3GTNSSD5X5YYZ33AA3CJ69I
