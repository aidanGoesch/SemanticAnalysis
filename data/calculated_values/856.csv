My wife doing kitchen works. And I'm doing some house works. Suddenly my wife go to unconscious suituation. I really scared. After few minutes my wife comes conscious level. I ask to my wife what is the problem please tell me?. She don't tell any problem to me. pregnancy results is one of the main part of everybody life both of their happy to heard about the pregnancy results. Because the little baby is come to ours life. Its a precious gift for couples life, Some peoples don't get this precious gift. they are really very sad. Rest when you are tired the sickness can get worse. Avoid foods with lots of sugar or saturated fats like sweets, chocolate and red meat. Carbohydrates things like bread, rice, potatoes and pasta can be easier to eat when she feeling nauseous. If possible keep away from triggers food or smells that make she feel sick I can by elastic acupressure wristbands from most pharmacies. These bands have a plastic button that presses on the acupressure point on the wrist and it may help relieve the nausea. This can be challenging especially if she were not ready to tell your colleagues about her pregnancy. If she feel very ill its probably a good idea to tell her manager at work at work that she were pregnant but you don't have to. If she do decide to tell them about her pregnancy this is a good time to talk about any changes to her work that help. For example she might need easier access to a toilet. Or if smells from the kitchen or canteen are triggering her sickness maybe she could move some where else until she feel better. Try not to worry too much about people knowing she was pregnant its more important to look after herself. If she was vomiting several times a day or are not able to eat and drink at all without being sick she may be dehydrated which is why she feel so bad. If her sickness is really severe and she were struggling to control it she may need to go into hospital for treatment. she feel free to better suituation for her life time.",,34V1S5K3GTNSSD5X5YYZ33AAEV869K
