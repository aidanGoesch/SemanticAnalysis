It was a sad day that day. My father had a few tears. My mother had a few more tears. My brothers and sisters all gave me a hug. I gave a speech about her life. She was an accountant. She always went to work with a smile. She always got the job done. She was the best accountant at the company. She had a few kids and a husband. They all loved her. She loved to eat cupcakes. She loved them if they had some sprinkles on them. We celebrated this by having a giant batch of cupcakes made for the burial. We all grabbed a cupcake and threw them into the grave before she was buried.",,30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C4JQZ07
