Within the last 6 months we have had a chance to get to know each other more. There have been some amazing ups and some heart aching downs. We are both emotional people that like to hide behind the confidence that we have in ourselves. It is refreshing when we both choose to be open and share how we really feel. A moment like that happened about four months ago. I was feeling down about my recent work experiences and slightly depressed due to memories of some past traumatic experiences. During this moment, he spent extra time with me doing simple things. We ate dinner together, watched movies at home and had long conversations. One night he stayed around and let me read a book to him. I really enjoyed his presence and appreciated the effort he put into assisting me to feel better. But I still was down. I am a bit of a nerd and enjoy technology. When he and I met I told him how I wished I had a laptop at home and internet connection and how it would make me happy. I guess he remembered after all those months. A month goes by of feeling down and out of the blue he suggest, ""Hey lets get you a laptop and I can provide internet connection."" I was shocked, that idea was not on my mind. When I am depressed I don't think much of what I can do to improve my life. I loved the idea and I felt as if the clouds in my rolled away and revealed sunshine. We decided on a laptop, split the cost and he provided me with a hot spot for internet service. I haven't felt depressed since the purchase. This may seem simple, but the internet is how I enjoy connecting the world and he showed me in his actions that he really understands me and that he does love me.",,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254052JQT
