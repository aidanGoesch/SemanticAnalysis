She raised me since I was a baby and I called her mom. She was my best friend. She died suddenly to an extent. She was diagnosed with lung cancer in August and she was fine up until then she just went downhill I go a phone call from the hospital where she was admitted and she died. I took care of her through it all.  I just feel so lonely and lost right now what will I do. I hear something on the news and that i know she be interested in even though the last week she was in the hospital I call her or tell her when I got to the hospital. I find myself thinking of her constantly and wondering will this pain ever subside. I question why do we die I know there are reasons I know when it’s your time it’s your time and when your job is done it’s done.  I am not ready to let go. I wanted you to stay with me. I wanted you to watch my children grow up and Arianna poor, little Arianna she already been through so much in her short life with heart surgery and cancer she now has to grieve for you. Maria- Eve is only four but she loved you so much and will miss you playing with her and giving her those frappes from McDonald's that keep her up at night and watching horror, movies she really loved you she was your little buddy. I just had a baby on August 5th Leilani you helped chose her name and now she will be too little to even remember how much you lived her. I have the memories though of you changing her evening though you were sick you still wanted to and she pooped in your hand. Then you changed her again and she pooped on you again. You thought it was funny and gross at the same time. I wonder now who in this world I will ever trust as much as you to watch them. You were my rock I love you and I miss you so much. I wish you knew how much I truly cared for you. You were my best friend and even though we had some doozy of arguments we always made up. I miss you, mom mom and I don’t think that this pain will ever go away, At least I can think of all the time s we shared like last Thanksgiving when the stove broke we made spaghetti on a hot plate till the new one there. I wonder if you were sick then and maybe if the doctors checked your lungs they would have found it but they just keep saying you had a sinus infection and now you are gone. I miss you so much I truly do and now I have to go but I am so scared and lost without you I truly love you.",,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254A1WJQP
