Everybody was setting up the stuff and I ended up taking the dresses with out the husband seeing them so I could take pictures of them first. I then took some pictures of the groom men and then the bride and the bride maids. I took a few of the maid of honor and the groom together. I took some pictures of the reception and the bride and groom together where the couldn't see themselves. I then went back to where the bride was and took some of them her getting ready. I then went back in the church where she was having her wedding and waited and made sure I had my camera ready to take there pictures coming in. I then started taking pictures of the wedding party and they looked so beautiful and it was a very pretty wedding.
