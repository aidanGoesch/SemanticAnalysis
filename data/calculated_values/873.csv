It ended up being in a really beautiful place. It was in a secluded place in the mountains. I had never been to this area before, but I would like to go back. The area made me feel nostalgic for some reason. The wedding itself was small and quick. It didn't last long and the church was small but beautiful.  There were not too many people there, it was was a nice little ceremony. I wish that more people on my brothers side were there. My brothers wife had a lot of family there which is fine. The after party was nice.  There was good food that were catered. All around the people there were nice as well. I think my brother was happy so that's all that matters. I had fun at the end of the day and it was a nice experience. It kind of made me wonder if I will ever get married and where. I still think about the location and how beautiful it was.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T3CQJZ,
