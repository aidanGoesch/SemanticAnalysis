It was very memorable because it was a whole lot different than his first wedding. His first wedding was hard for me. I had to drive a few states over to get to it. It was close to a 15 hour drive and it was just draining. And by the time the wedding happened, I was done. This one with the new wife was much more simpler. I was closer so the drive wasnt bad. I also like the girl he was marrying this time. It was a small wedding and it was in a beautiful area. I think that is what I remember the most was the mountains surrounding everywhere. It was just a nice time and I know my brother appreciated me and other friends showing up there. The actual wedding was quick and to the point which was nice. The after party had good food and it was a nice and peaceful time. It was also in the mountains which was pretty. Even when I left I kind of felt sad, it was a fun time that wasnt going to happen to me for awhile. I am not sure I will get married, but I wouldnt mind it be like this. It was just a simple and fun time to be around. I miss it already.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T3CQJZ,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T3CQJZ
