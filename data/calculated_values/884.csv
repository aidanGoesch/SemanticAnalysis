It is highly upsettingfor me. Kelley was my supervisor. She was he one who trained me. She sent me a text on my day off and told me not to come in that week. She said  they were ""trying something new"". A co worker messaged me on Facebook and asked what happened. She heard i got fired. I told her that she knew more than me becasue they hadnt even told me that i was fired. I am not that upset about it. I am getting unemployment and i actually already got another job. I start next week. Even though i am getting unemployment it is still upsetting and a bit humiliating. I dont know what else to say. Even though i had more than 600 cbharacters it still wouldnt let me advance without 15 sentences.",,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJ8EZGMO
