I was flying from Vancouver, Canada back to my hometown in New York. I was in Vancouver for a Spring internship that lasted four months. So needless to say, I was carrying a lot of stuff. I had two enormous suitcases and my carry-on backpack. Unfortunately, for me, I woke up late on the day of my flight. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6 am. I woke up at four-thirty and raced to the airport. Nonetheless, it was too late. I was stranded. I had already spent most of my money on rent and food during the internship. I didn't have a credit card, only a debit card with a purchase limit of $100 and $40 in cash. This was not enough to pay a new flight back to New York. I was sure that I was going to have to spend the night at the airport until I could get a hold of my parents. I told my story to a West Jet agent, I'll call Mike. Mike was a godsend. He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket. I was so happy and grateful. That was one of the few times in my life that I've seen someone truly go out of their way to help someone in need.",,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJXR1MGB
