My husband and I were anxiously waiting for the day to arrive. We were well prepared, prepped, and ready to go at a moments notice. When we arrived at the hospital, we were overcome with nerves and excitement. Things were taking a different route than they had with the birth of my son, so we did not know what to expect. Over the course of a day, we were well taken care of by the nurses and staff at the hospital and they helped move things along. When it came to the birth of my daughter, it all happened so fast! My husband and I were overjoyed to meet her. It is an experience like no other. Our small family of three quickly became a wonderful family of four. We were able to enjoy some precious time of just the three of us before her big brother came to meet her. I was feeling so happy with the arrival of our new baby, but also feeling anxious about my son meeting his new sister. It had been just him for 3 years, I was unsure how he was going to take to this new being entering his life. The past four months have been a learning experience for all of us. I am so excited with the bond my children are forming and with how our family is together. Things feel complete; we are all happy and healthy and that's all that matters.",,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VL3ST07
