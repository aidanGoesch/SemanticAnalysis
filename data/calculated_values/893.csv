It had heated seats, a great stereo system, and new rims. It looked perfect online. I had set up a meeting with the owner a few weeks ago and was excited to look at it. We met up at a best buy parking lot and it was everything he had said and more. He said he had a few other interested buyers so I wanted to hurry and pull out the money. When I had checked my account though there was a hold on my payments from Amazon and there was nothing I could do. It was really embarrassing and difficult to let the car go. We had been standing in the best buy parking lot for awhile. I begged him to hold the car for me. I went back online though yesterday and found the same car! It is a newer model though and its grey! I was able to meet up with the girl today and buy it. We are going to go change the title into my name tomorrow. Amazon even sent me the $400 I was waiting for. Things are looking up.",,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VM5IT02
