I just needed enough in my bank account to buy car insurance. I went in to Amazon payments and I would attempt to withdraw my balance to my bank account, receive a message that the withdrawal was successful, then receive an email that there was an error and my balance was returned to my account. This was the last day I could withdraw money because deposits aren't handled on weekends. I kept trying throughout the day because I needed the money in my account to buy the insurance. Just before the deadline to transfer the money it finally went though. The next day I found that all of the attempts went through and I had more than $400 in my account that I wasn't supposed to have. I didn't know how this would be handled by Amazon and didn't want to touch the money until it was fixed. I was afraid to use the money in case it was all taken out of the account to fix the error. In the mean time the seller of the car I was trying to buy removed the listing. I was angry and frustrated that this had happened and cost me the opportunity to buy the car. Eventually Amazon let us know that they would be fixing the account balance in our payment accounts and no money would be withdrawn from our bank accounts. This was great news but I still didn't have a car. I expanded my search and continued looking for a car. I found a 5 series BMW that was in great condition and immediately made arrangements to check it out. In the end I wound up buying the car in stead of the 3 series I was looking at before and was able to keep the $400+. Driving home I was the happiest I'd been in a long time.",34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VM5IT02,
