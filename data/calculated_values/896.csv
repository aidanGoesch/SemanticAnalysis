I can't believe I still feel so depressed about all of them leaving; it still feel so painful to me when I think about it. It's been so hard adjusting to not getting to see her all the time and almost worse is not getting to spend so much time with my niece and nephew. They're at that age where they're not really kids anymore but young adults and I was so looking forward to helping through the transition into adulthood. I understand why Sis had to leave, she had a great job opportunity that would make all of their lives better, but I just really feel left behind. I did finally make that therapy appointment I promised myself I would do. I go to my first appointment in three days. I'm actually looking forward to it and I really hope it will help me put things in perspective and sort of find a new thing to find more meaning in my life. I've been going out more with my friends and that's helps a lot for me to feel connected and like I still have a ""family"" around me, even though they aren't technically family. They've helped a lot since I decided to let more people into my life and try to fill the void left my Sis and kids leaving. Ya' know, as I'm sitting here writing about all of this and thinking about it, I think I should actually just get that plane ticket and plan a vacation to go and see them. They've been asking me to see them and their new place. I've been so depressed about everything that I keep saying no, but I think I probably should go and see them. I'm sure it would be great to see them and I really want to. I guess I'm just worried that when I have to leave all feel terrible all over again. I think I'll talk about this in my therapy appointment. I'm also really open to any suggestions the therapist has on how I can turn this situation around and make something, anything, really good come out of this. I guess I do have a lot to be thankful for.",,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VV4HT08
