My aunt had given me a horrible review on the public site, Mylife. com. She stated that she wouldn't be friends with me. She gave her son tons   of positive reviews the same day. I made me feel so worthless! I was very confused because I know she has a problem, but I didn't know how much. I saw the review and called Mom. I yelled and cried. I then left home and started walking out in torrential heat because I couldn't stand to be in my home. I kept thinking about how everyone probably saw it and thought I was an evil, malicious human being. After that, I started getting sick. I passed a kidney stone and underwent depression, but I am embarking on a physical and mental makeover. I evaluated my behavior and am determined to get strong and make peace with others. I will heal once I pray and release pain. Counseling will help.",,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VV4HT08
