First my mom fell and was hospitalized. The she had to go to rehab to be able to function better but instead of getting better she had to go to a nursing home. The doctors really didn't think she could live safely at home. Shortly after she died in the nursing home. It was the day we got the whole family together to visit her. I am really devastated about this all happening so fast. I still feel like I should be able to contact her anytime. I sometimes wonder if I just speak into the sky if she will hear me. I really should know better. I have never believed in that stuff. My family has been really supportive of one another. I am really glad they are all able to lean on each other. I am happy I have my boyfriend and my son to help me keep my mind off of it. I just don't know if I will ever stop grieving.,,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMC94MDW
