I go to many concerts and it is one of my favorite things to do so I knew I could really enjoy this experience. From seeing band members at the airport when I landed to being in the same boarding group I was excited for the week. There were bands on the cruise who I had been a fan of for years and they were all very accessible and laid back that you could sit and chat with them just like they are a regular person. There was one band in particular who I enjoyed and I was really looking forward to and they were only doing one performance on the cruise the first night. It was in a small lobby area with open balconies looking down, the area was packed full and the performance seemed so intimate and special that I still get goosebumps thinking about it. The singer commented that they were just guys who like sitting around a fire with an acoustic guitar and singing so they were going to do a sing-along, he and one of the guitarists sat on the bar and sang a cover and had everyone watching join in. All the concerts I go to and this was by far one that I will never forget. One other really unique part of this cruise is that they not only have complete bands but they also have individual musicians who do an all star jam type performance of famous covers. Before going I was told to not miss those performances and I made sure to watch each time they had one and was not disappointed at all. I have talked with bands since the cruise when they came to my city on tour and they all talk fondly about what a great time they had so it's really cool that both bands and attendees all have great experiences. The other thing that I really enjoyed is that anywhere you went during the cruise; the dining room or off the boat at ports, you would run into band members who were just having a great time and enjoying their vacation as well. There were no egos at all. We have booked to go back on the cruise next year and I'm getting excited because it's getting closer. I feel like I almost planned too much for this past year and now I know that it's ok to just go with the flow and relax.",30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C6ZNZ02,
