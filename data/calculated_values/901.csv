It was the day before my birthday and I was eagerly in anticipation of the fun party that I would have with my friends, and all the gifts that I would receive. Unfortunately, along with the excitement I started feeling sick and had a massive pain in my stomach. The pain was unbearable and I was taken to hospital. After days of having tests conducted on me, the doctor concluded that I was suffering from Crones Disease. The doctor told me that this was a severe disease that would impact my life in many ways. The doctor also told me that I had to change many of established lifestyle choices in order to combat this new ordeal. I was shocked, I had never gotten such bad news before. I had always felt that I was strong and that nothing could affect me. I was wrong, I was now in pain and if I did not change my life my future would be in doubt. Instead of being happy and getting a chance to celebrate my birthday, I had to change my diet, my weight management, and my eating habit because of this disease. I had always struggled to eat healthy, but now I had no choice, eating healthy was essential. The whole change process was difficult and mentally challenging for me, but I preserved and continued because I was determined to get better. A couple of months later, the changes started to feel easier and I was starting to feel less pain. I was glad everything was working and this motivated me to work harder. Now a days, I eat much cleaner and the whole process is way easier. To be totally honest with myself, I'm glad something like this happened to me. I'm now living a better life, have a healthier life, and a better value and outlook on life. This disease really enabled and pushed me to change my life for the better, I'm happy with the way things have turned out.",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMKXMMDY
