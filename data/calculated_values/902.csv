Since my last journal entry I have been to the hospital twice, had two flare-ups, and multiple bouts of pain in the abdomen. Life changing? Yes,. Fun? No, not at all. Since I have last written my journal entry I have had panic attacks. Many panic attacks.  I know this sounds trivial but they start when a flare-up starts and it tunes me into a cycle of throwing up and pain. Thats the worst part of it all is the pain that follows and although I use medical marijuana for PTSD, I am beginning to see that it isnt quite strong enough to stop the pain. I go to the hospital when it gets bad and they have to give me strong stuff to stop it. The thing is, I honestly think I am going to need prescription pain medicine to actually keep around in these events and nowadays you have to be close to dead to get that kind of medicine. I know people abuse it, but people abuse everything and its really just, unfair? In PA, if you have a medical marijuana card, you cant get pain medicine and if I stop using the dispensaries there is no guarantee my doctor will give me pain medicine. It feels like a big mess and thinking about it stresses me even more. Why do we even regulate it?",351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMKXMMDY,
