He shoots up regularly and has damaged himself so badly that at one point doctors thought his arm might need to be amputated. His girlfriend texted me begging us to help him. At first my husband was reluctant, but I was afraid that his brother would overdose and then he would feel guilty that he hadn't helped him, so I convinced him to do it. It was a difficult time for me and my family because it's hard watching someone you care about go through such a painful experience. It disrupted our regular routine and made life more hectic. He didn't follow the house rules we set and didn't get along well with my husband while he was here. He refused to go to rehab, so even though it was hard we felt like we didn't have much choice. He got really sick while he was with us and got upset because we wouldn't help him get more drugs. He has a tendency to feel sorry for himself, which really gets on my nerves, and so the tension was high. It made life difficult for my kids, which really upset me. It was not a good time for our family and I wish now that we hadn't made the choice to invite him in because it didn't really help. He left our home and started taking drugs again and is still upset with both of us. He avoids us at family gatherings, writes unkind things about us on Facebook and acts as though it's our fault that he's still on drugs. Also, his girlfriend kicked him out and he's virtually homeless now, which he also tries to partially blame on us.",351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMMMTMDL,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMMMTMDL
