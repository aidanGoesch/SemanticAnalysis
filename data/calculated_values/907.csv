I feel like I’m on another planet. Or, maybe I wish I was. Courtney won’t speak to me at all. For the last two months I have been losing sleep over trying to figure out what I could have done wrong. Who just suddenly stops talking to their best friend out of nowhere with no explanation whatsoever? Am I that bad of a friend? I’m angry. I don’t deserve this. I didn’t do anything. Maybe she’s a bad friend. Maybe I don’t need her. She has done horrible things to me and I forgave her every time. She didn’t come to dads funeral. She stole my boyfriend. She blew me off repeatedly because of some guy she was seeing. Still though, I moved past that, and if she can’t move past whatever it is that I did (if it’s anything at all), then maybe she’s not worth my friendship. What she is doing is wrong. Childish. She could at least talk to me and tell me what I did. But I guess I’m not worth her time and I don’t deserve an explanation. Whatever it is, I hope it’s worth losing a five year friendship over. I’m not apologizing if I don’t even know what I did. If she wants to talk, she can come to me. Until then, I will be living my life as if she doesn’t exist.",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMVH7DMP
