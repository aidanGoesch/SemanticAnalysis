I remember it like it was yesterday. The pain was unreal. I was riding through the neighborhood to work at my part time pizza job. No, I don't deliver on the bike, I just make the pizzas inside the store. Well, I'm really not sure what happened. I live in a rough neighborhood, so I think my wheel hit a piece of broken concrete. Next thing I knew, I was face first into cement. The way I landed, I actually broke my ankle. It swelled up immediately, and the pain was unreal. A nice old lady sat with me while the ambulance came. I didn't have health insurance, and still don't,  so I sobbed from both pain and stress. Hospital  visit was frustrating. I was there almost five hours and all they did was give me crutches and a cast. Not being able to get around was really the worst part. I got behind on bills and paid my credit card a couple months late. That was fun. Being a part time employee meant no benefits of course. I actually had to move back in with my mom after that. But it's okay, I was able to get healthy and I actually ended up enrolling in online classes. It's going pretty well. Hopefully I will get a better job soon. My life was really going no where so maybe the bike crash was a blessing in disguise.",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMVHUDMC
