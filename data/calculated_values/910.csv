It is the longest paved trail in the USA. It is between ninety to one hundred miles long. About twenty five miles into the bike ride, I flipped over my handlebars and crashed. I cannot remember exactly how it happened. Some people that witnessed the crash say that my back tire skid on something and that caused me to crash. The only thing I remember is realizing that I'm going over my handlebars in slow motion. Before I hit the ground, my head seemed to turn off. So I don't remember my head hitting the ground, fracturing my teeth, using my hands to try to stop my fall or any other parts of the crash. According to the doctor and nurse practitioner, it is perfectly normal to not remember anything before or after the crash. I just felt really lucky that I wore a helmet. I was told that if I did not wear a helmet I would have either been brain dead and in a coma or dead. I did split open an area right above my eye and it required stitches, but I did not have facial fractures, skull fracturing or any brain bleeding. Another great thing is that I did not break my wrists or arms in the fall when I tried to brace my fall. I am really happy that the couple found me and called the ambulance to come get me. The ambulance took me to the hospital and they helped take care of me by doing CT scan and some other tests. The CT scan showed that everything was fine in my brain. I didn't have any bleeding or swelling. I ended up being released from the hospital on the same day. A few days later my right eye was swollen and my lips were swollen from being busted during the fall. I looked terrible but I still decided to go outside and handle my life affairs. People would stare at me. Some people would think that someone had beat me up. I'll never forget some people thinking that I had been caught cheating with someone's girlfriend or wife by another man.",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMVHUDMC
