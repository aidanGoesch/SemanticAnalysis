I have a sad one from a funeral director's perspective. Separated parents are mourning the loss of their toddler at the visitation before the funeral. Mom is grieving unlike any mother I've seen grieve over the loss of a child, almost fake. She proceeds to pick up the child and 'hide' him in her coat and walks out the door while no one is looking. Other funeral director is like... holy sh*t, why is there an empty lil casket. The other funeral director finds the mom running to her car where he stops her and grabs kid. Separated parents have huge blow out at the visitation. We find out two months later that the mother and her new boyfriend had physically abused the kid, causing its death. Biological father had no idea. Separated parents are mourning the loss of their toddler at the visitation before the funeral.

EDIT: The mother and bf are still suspects, no one has been charged for the death as it is still under investigation. My (completely estranged) father showed up 20 years after swearing he'd never see any of his family ever again, at my grandfather's funeral. He then asked me to step into the hall with him, during my grandfather's benediction prayer, where it turned out he had asked the funeral director to remove me from the property. The family had no idea this had happened until 10 minutes later, at which point everyone left my grandfather's funeral in disgust. While they did their best to console me, my father took advantage of the lack of people around my grandmother, and he tried to talk her into moving into a home, and to sign the family properties into his name. She broke her hand hitting him.",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKHAMH4E
