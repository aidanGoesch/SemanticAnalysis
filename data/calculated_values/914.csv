You know, that moment that you'll be able to look back on and still remember ever little detail, because it just means that much to you? I was lucky enough to be able to experience that with Cash a few months ago. A few girlfriends and I had planned a last minute trip to Clearwater for a girls weekend. Somehow both Lydia's kids and Stacey's kids came down with this god awful stomach bug, so I asked Cash if he wanted to go instead. Spa days aren't exactly a five year old's idea of a grand time, so I knew I had to come up with something that both Cash and I would enjoy. On the flight to Clearwater, we discussed what we wanted to do and decided that fishing would be such an awesome experience for both of us. I grew up fishing, but Cash hadn't gone yet, since his dad wasn't exactly the outdoorsy type.  After a quick Google search and car rental, we were off to the pier to get our fishing permits and gear. When we got to the marina, I paid for the permits and sent Cash to the coolers to look at the bait. I just knew that the live worms and other bait were going to give him quite the shock. The little squeal he let out when he realized the bait was alive gave me a good laugh. After I paid the cashier, I collected our fishing rods and grabbed Cash's hand. It was time to show Cash the joys of fishing. We sat our stuff on the bench near the edge of the dock and I showed him how to bait his hook, and then we did some practice casts. After we both felt confident that he had grasped the concept, I told him to cast off the pier and get ready to do a lot of waiting. I swear, no sooner than his lure hit the water, he had a bite. He squealed with joy as he started reeling in his line. When he finally got the fish on the dock, I helped him remove the hook and toss the fish in the bucket, and repeated the process again. Cash caught a total of twelve fish in the three hours we were there, meanwhile I only caught a measly two. My pride was a little hurt that my five year old just showed me up at fishing, something that I grew up doing, but I could not have been more proud. I think I might have passed on my love for fishing to Cash and that is totally worth it.",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKIACH45
