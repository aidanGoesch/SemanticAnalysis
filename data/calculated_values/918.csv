I was tired and fed up with the conditions of my work environment and pay on top of that. On this day, I planned on spending my entire evening looking for another job. Around lunch time I was called in for a random meeting(that was not planned). I figured I was somehow in trouble for something. Turns out, it was completely opposite of what I had expected. My superior sat me down and he had a stack of papers in his hand. It was a contract stating my terms of employment would be changing if I agreed. My title was being changed along with my pay rate. I was just stunned, because I felt like my hard work was often dismissed and not even recognized. After going through this contract, I signed my name, thanked my superior, and nearly skipped out of this conference room. My new pay rate would take effect in my next pay check. It was a fairly significant increase, so I was excited to see what kind of checks I would be making now. With my promotion, came a new office as well. Overall it was a good day. Very unexpected, but in the end I was appreciative my hard work had finally been recognized.",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKKIRH42
