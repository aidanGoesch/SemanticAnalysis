I was backing up a forklift and listening to some tunes.  I almost crushed Tom against the loading dock wall.  I was really shaken up.  He screamed at me, and the boss screamed at me.  I didn't get fired.  But I found I couldn't work any more.  My hands shook so hard I could hardly drive.  I couldn't bring myself to look at Tom or even use the forklift.  So I quit.  I won't get unemployment, and I haven't been able to get another job.  I can't get a good reference from Dynaco.    Mary will have to go back to work while I watch the kids.  We are really hurting financially.  I don't know what else to do.",,30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C71PZ09
