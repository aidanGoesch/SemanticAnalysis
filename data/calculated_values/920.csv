My husband i have been trying to conceive for about a year and we finally did it. We were very excited! We had our first ultrasound when i was about 6 weeks pregnant, we saw our little bean and saw a heartbeat which is always such a relieve. For some reason i was very scared about miscarriage even though i've never had one, i'm still young and pretty healthy. But for some reason i kept googling the chances of miscarriage. A week later i had another ultrasound to measure baby on good equipment and there wasn't a heartbeat anymore. My little baby passed away... I was in denial. I thought it was a mistake, i couldn't process it. I had 2 more ultrasounds in 2 different clinics to confirm this horrible diagnose. My baby's heart stopped beating a couple of days after we saw a heartbeat. It was so heartbreaking. One of the worst experiences in my life. I miscarried 3 weeks later in the ER. I had a horrible postpartum depression and had suicidal thoughts. I was in a very dark place but God surrounded me with so much love. I feel much better now",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKPUEH4I
