For me, this would be my 3rd graduation I'd experience, and the one that was most important to me of all: my college graduation. I'd finally done it. I've earned enough credits to get my bachelor's degree in the field of economic marketing. I couldn't be more proud. On the day it happened, almost my whole family happened to show up. They were so incredibly proud of me, probably more than I was even proud of myself. I knew that they were so happy for me because of all the wonderful amazing compliments that I got that day. I got praise from mom, dad, grandpa, cousins, aunts, uncles, you name it, and they were proud. I was the first in my family to graduate college. Nobody else had yet accomplished what I just did. We all went out to a fancy restaurant after. It was such an incredible experience. I will always remember looking back on this day so fondly. I love my family, and can't wait to get a good job offer.",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKPV24HV
