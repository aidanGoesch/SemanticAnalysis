I went with my husband to Walt Disney World. We rode many rides that weekend. I got to shake hands with Goofy. I hugged Minnie. I gave Mickey a fist bump. The teacup ride was very fun to ride on. Epcot center had a lot of neat cultures to observe. The Star Wars area was neat. I got to hug a stormtrooper. This was a great break from the daily work grind. We got to get a break from the stress of the modern world. This weekend made us relax enough for us to not worry about the daily grind for a few days. Only thing bad about it is that it ended. Normal life will be stressful again.,,354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQFYS002
