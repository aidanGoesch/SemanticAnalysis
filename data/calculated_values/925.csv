We went without the kids and it was just the two of us. I was really excited because I love Disney and have a great time whenever I go there. The first day, we landed and went straight to a park. We went to Animal Kingdom and spend the entire day there. It was really hot, but I didn't care. We went on all the rides and had all the good snacks they had available in the park. The next day we went park hopping. We went to Epcot and the Magic Kingdom. The last day we went to Hollywood studios, which is my favorite of all the parks. I didn't want to leave. I feel like there is something magical about Disney and it makes me feel like a kid whenever I am there. I especially loved that it was just my husband and I there together. It was a lot more relaxed than when we take the kids along. We got to take our time and really enjoy everything. It was also nice spending time together, just him and I. We got to get away from everyday life and stress and reconnect. We shared romantic dinners and just enjoyed each others company away from it all. It was a memorable trip and I will never forget it.",354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQFYS002,354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQFYS002
