I had a close friend that recommended me to visit Cancun, Mexico. We booked our all-inclusive week-long vacation and we were ready for our big adventure. To be honest I was a little hesitant because I always thought that Mexico was a very dangerous country. To my surprise, right when we landed, I noticed that everyone was very nice at us, I was also very impressed because most of the service providers are bilingual, so it was really helpful being able to communicate in our language. When we got to the Hotel, I loved the suite, it was very luxurious , spacious and clean. The view to the ocean was also PERFECT. We really took advantage of the all-inclusive package and I loved the fact that there were at least five different restaurants for all kinds of preferences. (American, Chinese, Mexican, etc). There were also two night clubs inside the Hotel. We loved the private beach (connected to the Hotel) the white sand, and turquoise ocean water, and our unlimited cocktails. We bought tickets to some attractions such as the Chichen Itza (Mayan Ancient City) and the Tour at Xcaret. My family loved the Mayan performance at the end of our Tour at Xcaret. It was a beyond wonderful experience. The Mexican food that we tried was delicious, there were cochinita pibil tacos (seasoned pork) and we just loved the taste. The only thing that we did not like is that we miss one of our booked attractions because we were late for the transportation, other than that it was an unforgettable experience that we can to live again.",354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQHQ7003,
