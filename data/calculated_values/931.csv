My boyfriend's grandmother passed away, and while we weren't technically family, she definitely felt like a family member to me.  She had always been so sweet and welcoming to me and I felt very close to her.  When she had to go into the nursing home after her knee replacement surgery, it wasn't that big of a deal because it was only for rehabilitation, so it wasn't like she was giving up her independence.  She was going to be back in her own home in about 6 weeks.  But she never went home.  During orthopedic rehab she fell and injured her other leg.  Of course everyone in her family was upset and so was I, but we still didn't think that it was a life threatening injury.  Then, after she was transferred back to the hospital, she developed a blood clot in the leg, it shot to her lungs and she was gone overnight.  My reaction was shock, I could hardly believe it could happen like that.  At first my boyfriend and the rest of the family seemed to be reacting the same way, in other words in an appropriate way.  Then after the funeral, things started to change.  People started making comments along the lines of how they felt relieved  that she was gone because they wouldn't have wanted to take care of her if she hadn't recovered well from the fall injury.  More and more family member started to agree with this, even my boyfriend.  They all seemed to be over their grief so quickly.  This response has been so devastating to me.  It's like I can't even turn to these people in my time of grief.  I honestly don't even know if I want to continue in my relationship after this because I can't believe he feels this way.",,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFW1UGS7F
