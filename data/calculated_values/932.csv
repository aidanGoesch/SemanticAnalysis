Her critical health condition did not surprise anyone as her health had been declining for months. On top of that she had dementia from mid stage Alzheimer's so she really didn't remember much of anything. The day she was admitted to the hospital she collapsed in her room at the nursing home. They rushed her to the hospital. The doctors said that she shattered the bone in her shoulder. They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago. She would continue to decline due to her dementia. At least she was able to pass before she progressed into late stage Alzheimer's. Regardless, it impacted me. My boyfriend hugged me as his mother cooked breakfast",,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFW1UGS7F
