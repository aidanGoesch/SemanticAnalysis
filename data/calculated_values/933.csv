It's made me question my perspective on everything from my self concept to my understanding of love and the impermanence of life. Mom had a rare form of cancer that was hard to diagnose and radically aggressive. We only found out about it when she had a body MRI and the tumor was discovered in her kidney. She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, ""I love you."" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson. This lesson for me is about grief. Grief is a hard emotion, but a necessary one. Without grief you cannot know love.",,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFW1XCS7H
