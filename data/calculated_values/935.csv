I decided to let him rest and it was very tough more me to actually go about getting him put to sleep. I know i'll see my old friend when were both in a better place. My dog was full of energy and I really enjoyed having him around. I remember he would defend me from other dogs and people who were dangerous. I will really miss him. I can't wait to meet him up in heaven. He will be greatly missed. It's going to be hard to move on. I don't know If I should get anymore dogs. I may not take dying dogs very well.
