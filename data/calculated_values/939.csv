Previously I discussed how my ex spouse was court ordered to make my car payment.  He didn't and my car was repossessed.  We later went to court because he was in contempt/ violation of the court order.   He basically got a slap on the hand.  Fast forward to today.  He continues to be responsible for the same bills, minus that specific car payment and now had to make a car payment on another car.  He has failed to make any kind of payment in the last 3 months, not even child support.  The divorce has taken over a year to finalize. I don't see an end in site.  His attorney recently requested to be dismissed from his case.  I guess my ex thinks he is above the law.  We will see if he gets a slap on the hand this time.  He is of course, in contempt again.   We will have a trial scheduled.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHJS7G,
