They told me that my car just left on the back of a truck.  I had expected that my car was going to be repossessed because  husband had been ordered to make that car payment.  He failed to do so.  I felt horrible and I felt scared because I was unsure what I was going to do. He had been ordered by the court to make the payments.  We eventually had a contempt hearing where he was ordered to catch up all bills and he would be paying the payment on a new vehicle.  It worked out well for me though because the new car I received was a lower payment.  Eventually I will have to take that payment over and when I do I will be able to afford it.  Everyone thinks my ex is a loser including myself.  I was so furious with him for not caring enough to make sure his children had transportation.   I have been in an ongoing divorce situation for almost a year.  Who would have thought a divorce would take this long to happen.   He is arguing over finances.  He barely visits the children.,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHJS7G,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHJS7G
