The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated.  It started with a very long labor for my wife who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs, and during this time she needed me more than ever.  I had to be strong, physically and emotionally, to help her cope.  Eventually she took the epidural and the labor became more of a waiting game.  But giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions.  As a result, she had to have a C section, a devastating result for her and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down.  Once that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered.  She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond to us.  I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being.  Having family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation.  It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for.  The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind.  The following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything.  Having the nurses there for support and questions was something we never wanted to give up.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWQB27S3,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWQB27S3
