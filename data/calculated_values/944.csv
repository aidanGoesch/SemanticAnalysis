His trainer bike was getting too small, and it was about time for him to learn how to ride with his Dad on the trails. We went to Target and picked one out. He was SO excited to get home and try it! Unfortunately it wasn't magic like we'd hoped. Balancing is hard, and he's not the most graceful child to begin with. I tried walking next to him and holding onto the bike, but we both ended up colliding with each other and it wasn't helping at all. We were both frustrated and disappointed and I was scared it was going to hurt his love of riding. So, I hopped on the trusty internet and started google-ing methods to teach kids to ride bikes. The most helpful advice said to start at the top of a long, slightly inclined hill and just... let go. I was skeptical. But, we had a helmet, and had a walking path with grass on either side, so we gave it a shot and he stayed upright down the entire hill! I was so proud of him. I didn't take pictures because I was so absorbed in the moment, but that was the only confidence we needed. He's a great rider now! They just finished their first trail ride yesterday and Mason loved it!",,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ0JDGYN
