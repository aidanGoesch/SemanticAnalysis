I couldn't wait to get out there and refresh myself after this past year of working, but when we landed, I couldn't help but shake the news story I read on the flight down. ""Shark mauls Toronto man in Punta Cana"" was the headlines of the ABC News article I read, describing how a man from Toronto got too close to a shark in a scuba diving adventure when the shark lashed at the man. I was planning to go snorkeling for my first scuba experience, and this really threw me off! My wie kept reassuring me that this was a one off chance, but boy was I worked up. I don't often feel scared, but this was something that really threw me for a loop. Fortunately, I was able to come back down to earth and convince myself it would be worth it to go, especially when we talked with some local divers that said that the person was snorkeling in an unsanctioned area known for shark activity and that they had not taken proper safety precautions. I knew that I would always spring for the safer option, and that's what we ended up doing. It ended up being a giant thrill! Seeing the immense array of colorful animals and the diversity below the surface really opens your eyes to how full of life our planet is. I honestly think I could snorkel full-time, it was that exciting! So much so that our planned 1 snorkeling event turned into a 3-day snorkeling tour that we signed up and which blew me away. Sure, relaxing on the beach and spending quality time was fun. But, these unique experiences really showed me what I've been missing. Honest, I can't wait to get back under the water again. Thanks, Punta Cana, I'll see you again soon.",,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ0JUGY4
