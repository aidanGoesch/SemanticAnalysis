I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.  I hope that I will not fail.",3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS
