After she was laid off she has been having trouble finding gainful employment. It's too bad, because we both really loved this house and this neighborhood. Our neighbors never bothered us and were always so friendly. They were people I felt I could rely on if I needed something. Now we're living in this horrible studio apartment and our new neighbors are up at all hours of the night. It sounds like they're constantly throwing a party. Our combined bedroom/kitchen is entirely too small and it's putting some pressure on our relationship. We had our own separate hobby rooms before so we could always take a break from each other, but now we're constantly forced to be in the same room. I'm the kind of person that needs some space every now and again, and I'm starting to realize how clingy Tina has always been. I hope she starts working soon so we can leave this horrible apartment and neighborhood, but I think she might have given up. I feel like I'm forced to give an ultimatum. That either she starts working soon or we'll have to go our separate ways. My stress levels have increased significantly since we have moved and I'm now constantly overeating. There's no telling how many pounds I've gained. I miss my old home.",,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQHJLYGU
