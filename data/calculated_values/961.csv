My normal routine of eating breakfast and then taking my dog out for a walk. My dog Molly seemed really tired. She is usually in a very good mood but for some reason she seemed off today. Anyways, I did not make a big deal out of it. I come home after the walk, and start getting for ready to work. I was running late. I couldn't keep the patients waiting. I say bye to my dog and head out. My day at work was busy. I come home around 3 pm. I call out for Molly but she wasn't there. I must have left the door open. I start freaking out and worrying. I went around walking looking for her but she wasn't there. Thankfully she came back home to me.",,358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCR2RPXVK
