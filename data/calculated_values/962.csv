I went to tell my wife, but she just said that he would be OK because his name was Molly. That just made me feel worse. I went to tell Dad, but he said the same thing. So I decided to go and look for him myself. I looked for him in the garden, but he wasn't there, so I looked in the paddocks where Mum and I had taken him for his walks. Then I went into the back yard to let the other dogs out of their kennels to look for him. I thought they might be able to help me find him, but I couldn't even find him with the other dog's help. So I gave up and put the other dogs back in their kennels, it was getting dark anyway. I had my dinner and went to bed. In the middle of the night I heard something scratching on my bedroom door. I got up and turned on the light, and what did I see? I saw Molly. I let him into my bedroom and I hugged him and I patted him. I love my dog Molly, he's the best. I felt relieved and so happy to see  him again.",,358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCR2RPXVK
