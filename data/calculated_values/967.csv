He did, however, show up to see the kids in a 2019 Cadillac that he could afford. In addition to this, he was arrested for drug trafficking when they raided his house and they ended up seizing the house and allowing him out on bond. At this point, he got arrested again eight days later for dealing drugs in another county. They also released him on bond. Then ten days after that, he was pulled over and arrested again for driving on a suspended license and drug trafficking again. At this point, he is denied bond, so I can not get my money or any child support from him.  He can't seem to pay me, but the payments on his new car are still being made. In addition to this, he has managed to pay for a personal attorney in all of his cases. He has also paid for a different lawyer to try to get him bond, but if he gets bond, I know he will not end up paying me. As of this point, all of my joy over him being required to finally do something for his children has been squashed by the fact that he will not be paying us anything. The only thing that I have to be happy about the situation is that I know that he will not die because of drugs, and he will not be around my children, making their lives miserable. They won't have to see him constantly on drugs or be disappointed in him any more than they already are. So unless he is granted bond, I am forced to cut my losses. The only way I can do anything further is if he is able to get bonded out of jail.",358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8GVXW,
