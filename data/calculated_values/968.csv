He has been abusive over the last few years and left myself and the children with nothing. I was pinning kitchen towels on my son because we had no diapers. He had been ordered to do things over and over as our marriage went on and decided not to abide by any of the agreements we made that were turned into court orders, but no one ever did anything about those things. I finally was able to take him to court and get justice for myself and my children. We went to court last month on a Rule to Show Cause for why he had not done the things that were in the agreement. He got a lawyer, but I could not afford one, as it took me 10 months to save up the money for filing for the hearing in the first place. When we started testifying, his lawyer kept breaking in to say that the things that I was trying to tell her were irrelevant, but I needed to get the information out there to prove why they were relevant. He also lied to the court regarding what I was testifying about and had lied in many cases in the past and always won based on those lies. In one case, he lied in a child support case to the extent to where the judge wouldn't listen to anything I said and even went so far as to deny me child support in the case, leaving the kids and I with nothing at all from him but what we were able to talk him out of at holidays, which typically was not much. But for some reason, this judge was different. She actually listened to me and let me present my evidence and connect the dots in the case. I didn't have an attorney, so I wasn't really sure what I was doing and I was scared that he would be laughing at me on the way out the door again, as he always did when they won. But she was patient with me and gave me a chance to locate the information that she needed in order to decide what she was going to do about is. There was one part of the case that he should have been responsible for paying for that she dismissed, because of an error at the courthouse that caused his attorney to not have all of the documentation that she needed, but the judge said that she would allow me to bring that case back with the proper paperwork, so that they could fix the error and she would decide on that separately. When it was over, she ordered him to comply with the order and pay me everything that he owed me within 45 days or go to jail. This was extremely emotional for me because myself and my children are having a hard time living with no income and we were at risk of having some of our utilities turned off. Now we are doing a little better and have been getting some payments from him, which is nice, considering that we were getting nothing at all prior to the court case. Before we left, my heart sank a little because his attorney threatened to appeal the case which would mean that I would have to wait even longer to get anything done or get some help with the kids, he was not able to and had to start paying me.",358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8GVXW,358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8GVXW
