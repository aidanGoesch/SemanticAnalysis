I followed my parents rules as a good kid. I used to  study permanently. I also had a good relationship with moneys. I used to be a good saver. All of this continued to happen until I met my boyfriend. From that moment I started spending a lot of moneys. We were students together and we studied together. The problem was that I didn't saved anymore. We used to go out every night, and started shopping some expensive clothes. I didn't asked my parents for more money, cause I would have been ashamed in front of them. So I made a decision. I knew I was the one to save my self. I started of having some debts from my cousins. If I could't stop I would have been going deeper and deeper. I started a job. It really helped me on my finances that I needed for my studies. I'm glad I didn't ask from my parents.",,358UUM7WR0PH0DFOIP3D02A0FUXR7U
