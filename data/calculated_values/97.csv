With public school out of the question (poor quality and too much liberal propaganda, thank you very much), I had to homeschool. Now, having to homeschool was something I dreaded even before my children were born. I hate teaching. I think everyone should do their job, the one they trained for.  Well, I never trained for teaching, and let's say I'm not a natural. Anyway, somehow I'd made it through the year. I learned to enjoy some parts of it, and my children made progress, but for the most part, I still hated it, and I'm afraid it showed. So when the year was over, I sat there and wondered what I was going to do next school year. I couldn't imagine homeschooling AGAIN, yet there seemed to be no other options. I checked other Christian and private schools in the area - way too expensive. I kept thinking about it, same thoughts circling in my mind. I went to get mail - and there was a letter from my kids' old school in the mailbox! At first, I thought maybe it was about some old bill I forgot to pay. I opened it... and I couldn't believe my eyes! It said the school was re-opening! With slightly lowered rates, too!! How do I describe this terrible weight instantly lifting off my shoulders? No more darn teaching!! My children will get to experience a normal classroom, teachers, and schoolmates. I was SO happy.",30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C72D0Z0,30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C72D0Z0
