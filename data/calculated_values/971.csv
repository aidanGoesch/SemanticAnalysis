It is one of my most favorite times of the year as it is a great time where I can bond with my family. The problem is that because of the poor weather around our area, sometimes it's hard to figure out a date where everyone in my family can get together and have a fun day at the ponds. My Aunt usually checks the weather one week ahead so I got the invitation only last week. It didn't bother me at all though because I would clear my weekend schedule for this, it's one of my favorite things that we do each year. I also love the fact that my Aunt caters the derby with Cracker Barrel as it is one of my favorite restaurants. She also has a few carnival games set up and we do some field day type games like the egg toss and a potato sack race. It's basically a really fun time where our family can just forget about all of our problems. There are prizes for the top 3 biggest fish that are caught. I actually got 2nd place this year which is my best finish ever and I got a $50 Gift Card to Amazon! My cousin ended up finishing first and he caught a bass that weighed 7 pounds. Sadly, my fish was only 6.4 pounds so I was close but I'll try better next year. First prize was a $100 Gift Card to Amazon. It wasn't about the prize for me though, the experience is worth way more than the gift cards anyway. I love getting to spend time with my family and this event is the most fun we have all year long. I look forward to it each year and hope it never ends.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS21XAVZ5
