I had not seen or heard from him in the last 3 years. I knew that it must be bad news or he would not have called. He spoke of his regrets of missing out on my childhood and my children. Myself and my children ranging from 5 to 25 all drove together the 7 hours to his town. We visited him in the hospital and he was able to see and spend time with his family. I felt very emotional. I had so many regrets of the years he missed in mine and their lives. I felt fear. My father told me that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I saw all the hope I have always had that one day He would be a dad and grandfather disappear. I have spent my life filled with this hope that one day he will come and love me and be a dad.  We visited the next day and we came back home. The next week my dad was hospitalized again and then was being sent home with hospice. I set up care for my children and family, and I drove to my father. I brought him home. I got to spend one week, seven day in total with my father. I was his daughter. I was his caretaker. I now in detail every regret he has ever had, I know his pain, and he knows mine. I held my fathers hand and told him how loved he is and always will be. I was holding his hand as he passed away. His last words to me were how much he loves me. I can't write anymore.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2AVNZVR
