We were going about 70-80 mph. I was so shocked and after coming to a complete stop, the car next to me gets SLAMMED into the car in front. I was super shocked to see the car just crumble and the sound from the accident was gut wrenching. They were in the very left lane. I pull my car to the side and dial 911. As I am dialing 911 I step out of the car and try to help the guy who got sandwiched. He had a bloody face and broken shoulder. His seat belt was stuck so I take out my safety blade for car seat belts and cut the belt. The guy is free from the restraints! I help him out, give him a bottle of water that I had in the trunk of my car, and I go to help the next guy. The guy who started the accident was pretty badly messed up. Bloody face, possible broken ribs, legs were wrecked, and all airbags deployed. I did not trust myself to help the guy get out. I couldn't risk any chances of getting him out and paralyzing the kid. He was no older than 18. A brand new driver. The guy at the front of the accident was already out of his car but looked like he was in a daze. The paramedics arrive, I explain to them what happened, gave cops my statement, and headed back to the fair.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2AX8ZVG
