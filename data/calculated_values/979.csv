Our love, bond, and loyalty has only grown with every year of new adventures and exciting times. We have had ups and downs, high and lows, ebbs and flows. The good times have made our love deepen and the hard times have only made us stronger. We have two beautiful children that have completed our family and our lives. We have supported each other through jobs, stresses, monumental events, family deaths, etc. We were proud of our journey and relationship and wanted to celebrate the enormous milestone of ten years of a healthy and happy marriage. We decided to renew our vows in front of family and friends. We wanted it to be a joyous occasion marked by love, fun, dancing, food, and great memories. We invited friends and family from all over the country to join us for dinner and dancing. It was a lovely weekend that everyone is still talking about! I wore a gorgeous dress and my husband looked handsome in his tuxedo. Our children attended and got to share in the love of our marriage. We made amazing memories that we will never forget. Most importantly, we remembered how and why we have lasted ten years and made a promise to last another ten and beyond.",35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z88VZN,
