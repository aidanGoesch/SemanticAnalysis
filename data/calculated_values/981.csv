We got to Denver and got ourselves a suitable place to stay. The following day when we were fully relaxed, we visited the breweries, where I and my boyfriend was able to see and learn a little on how beer are produced. Later that same day we went to a game station, where I and my boyfriend was able to play hockey. Though I didn't know much about hockey but he taught me and it was fun. Then a day after, I and my boyfriend went out to see our friend to catch up on old time. We all had fun and they also show us around. Denver is one of the most beautiful place have ever been to. It has the most beautiful stores, mall, eateries one can visit. Denver also have different varieties of food one will want to taste. I and my boyfriend also tasted all the delicacy there. We and our friends also went for shopping, we had a small get together party, where we talked about our Jobs, families and some places we would all love to visit. Later that day we had to say our goodbye because that was the last day of our stay at Denver. It's a trip I and my boyfriend will always remember. This is one kind of trip that I will never forget. It is a memorable one spending time with my boyfriend could be fun and lovely. Through our friends we get to know more people, get to mingle with other and also get to have more friends",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z9UVZB
