I proceeded to go   into the kitchen made my lunch then fed my cats and off I went to the office. Traffic  was very bad that morning stop and   go. As I sat in traffic I got so sleepy I could hardly keep my eyes open. The longer I stayed in traffic the worse I felt,, I couldn't keep my eyes open. I finally got a block from my office and came to a stop light and don't remember going through the red light and hitting another car. After  I hit the car of course my air bag went off and knocked the air out of me leaving me having a hard time breathing. I then heard the sound of an ambulance  approaching. Two medic got out and tried to get me out of my car but the could't because   my leg was badly messed up and bleeding. Needless to say I broke my ankle  and had to have pins put in it plus a compound fracture of my leg and all my ribs on my right side broken. I stayed in the hospital for about two weeks and had a lot of physical therapy. This happened about six months ago and I am still having a little trouble walking but little by little I'm getting better.  The accident was indeed my fault, I'm so  glad the other person did not have any injuries . I since learned I have sleep- apnea and that is why I fell asleep at the wheel. I worry about driving and at times very nervous but with time I know things will get better.  I had to drive with my son to get the courage  to drive again and even then I was very nervous and shaky . You never know what will happen when you leave home to go to work so always try to be prepared.",,35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K82E8X34
