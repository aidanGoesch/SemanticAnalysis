The other team was winning until my daughter came up to the plate. I saw her hit a double and this caused a couple of runners to make it to home plate. This double made my daughter's team win the game. They were jumping up and down in excitement. I was very happy and yelling in this victory. I celebrated by taking her to a pizza place. We ordered a meat lovers to share. She was hungry and ate half of it. I ate the other half the pizza. We both burped at the same time. This made us both have a good chuckle. This day will be remembered forever. We both went home with big smiles.",,35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8S1O3XQ
