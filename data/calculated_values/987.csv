However, I still think about that big hit that she had during an important game. I was so proud of her and I could tell she was proud of herself. Her team was down by two runs and it was her turn to bat. As a parent I was nervous and excited. I didn't want her to fail and this could be a good confidence boost. She walked to the plate while her favorite song played Motley Crue ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and took her position. For the record, her best friends grandpa is Mick Mars from that legendary rock band and she picked it. Anyway, while up at bat she had a couple of strikes and a ball before she finally got a piece of the ball. She hit the sweet spot on the bat and the ball soared into the outfield. She was able to make a double and a RBI to win the game for her team. She was so proud of herself and I was too. I don't think she knew that she was capable of getting a big hit. It was a defining moment for her and something I still think about. I am hoping she will want ot play softball again next year.",35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8S1O3XQ,
