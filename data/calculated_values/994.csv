Dog's need that, you know? I like to take care of my little buddy. Unfortunately, things didn't go as planned. I brought her in, left for a little bit to go eat lunch--suddenly, I get a call. Apparently my dog has an issue, I ask what. The vet doesn't sound too optimistic. She tells me about her enlarged Lymph nodes, and my concern suddenly dwarfed any other concern I had in life. I couldn't eat. I talked to the vet and she gave me my options. I wrapped my little buddy up and went home. I couldn't sleep, I was so worried about her. I went to work tired and worried, the stress was immeasurable. I waited two weeks for another call from the vet, and she told me there was nothing to be concerned about, perhaps she was just sick or it was a exceptional mistake or error in judgement. I was happy, but now possible issues are always in the back of my mind when taking my dog anywhere.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F
