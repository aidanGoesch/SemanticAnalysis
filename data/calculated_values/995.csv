I was shocked and confused. The vet advised me to have a test done to rule out any diseases or cancer. It was quite scary.  After researching the test online, I realized how dire this situation is.  I felt like I was in trouble and the anxiety and fear set in.  The test results took at least a week to get. I was an emotional wreck the entire time. I didn't sleep very much.  When they finally called and I heard those words ""she doesn't have cancer"", a weight suddenly lifted and I felt such relief. My dog wasn't going to die.  I could go back to being happy again. I realized I need to make the most of her time here with me. They have such short lives.  They deserve to have a happy life while their alive. This changed my life.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F,
