This was  a routine visit where they put her under anesthesia and clean her teeth.  As soon as I arrived back home I was contacted by the vet.  she proceeded to tell me my dog's lymph nodes were enlarged. I had no idea what this meant.  She proceeded to explain to me that it doesn't mean anything good. there's something wrong with my dog. Her lymph nodes are working hard and that's why they are so enlarged.  She suggested I get a find needle aspiration done to her lymph node to have it tested right away.  I had to wait a few days only to find out it was inconclusive.  I had to bring her back in for minor surgery so they could pull a piece of lymph node out and test the tissue.  One full week later and a lot of worry and sleepless nights I get a call. she's not sick.  She doesn't have cancer. She has a rare deformity that even the vets can't even explain fully. I was told it doesn't mean anything bad.  I've never felt so relieved in my life. One of the best days ever.,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F
