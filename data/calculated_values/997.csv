She'd  been away working in another country and she just moved back to our city earlier this month. The first thing I did that morning was text her and see where she wanted to go. She recommended the local cafe that we used to go to for lunch all of the time before she left. Best of all? This was going to be a girl's day, just the two of us, NO BOYFRIEND ALLOWED. I drove to meet her at 12:30 p.m. and we met in the parking lot at about 12:45. When I saw her, I almost started to cry and I think she did, too. She was my best friend, my person, my soul sister, and we were finally reunited after what felt like 10 years. We hugged each other in the parking lot and neither of us wanted to let go... until we realized just how hungry we were. Letting each other go, we were already starting to catch up on things when we entered the restaurant, and we even got our favorite table: the one right next to the window. It finally felt like everything was falling back together again! I asked her about her time away and she spent time asking me about Cory (my boyfriend) and I, and if we had finally tied the knot yet. I told her we were thinking about it, and as soon as he popped the question, she would be my maid of honor for sure. I told her I couldn't imagine a wedding without her in it, and then she started to get quiet. She was tearing up, and I didn't know why. I thought I said something to offend her? Maybe she was upset that I brought Cory into the conversation? I asked her what was wrong after a few minutes of silence and I already knew something major had happened before she spoke... and then she told me the truth. The reason she had moved back home is because she was diagnosed with colon cancer. She wanted to begin her treatments at home, surrounded by her close friends and family, because she didn't know how effective they would be. The cancer had already progressed before it was diagnosed. I wanted to cry, too, but I didn't want to make her upset. I promised her that day that I would fight with her every step of the way, and no matter what happened, she wouldn't be alone.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J7LA3ZM
