I hadn't seen her in over a year. I flew to her hometown with my boyfriend and met my friend early so I could go out with just her and so that he could sleep in. We got brunch. She took me to a place (Snooze) that she was really excited about for me because of the great food and decor there. She was absolutely correct that I would love it - I did love it. We ordered separate entrees, hers being sweet and mine being savory. She told me that she thought pomegranate arils were unnecessarily extra on pancakes and I agreed with her. We loved the food we ordered and shared our food with each other to appreciate how good the other person ordered, as well. We ordered boozy breakfast cocktails. We caught up in a way we hadn't been able to for years because it was the first time we had spent any time alone in years. I had seen her the year before when we went, or maybe it was the time before that, but I was with my boyfriend. My best friend is someone I share a lot of similar thoughts with, and it was nice having that time together to remember why we got close to each other in the first place. I still think that is the favorite thing I've done all year. This includes when I went to Sonoma with a group of friends that my best friend wasn't a part of for wine tasting.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J7LA3ZM
