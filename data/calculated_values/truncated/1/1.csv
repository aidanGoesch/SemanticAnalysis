Two months ago my brother and his lovely wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and they name her Claudia after our great grandmother. I was so surprised when they told me they were going to have a baby. They tried for a long time and really had thought they would never be parents. So many times they had to go to the fertility clinic and they would get their hopes up just to be disappointed.  But finally our little miracle arrived. I was so proud of my brother and how he handles the birth of his child. I was lucky enough to be invited into the delivery room. It was really amazing to watch the birth of little Claudia and Jill my brothers wife was so brave. She really did a great job. Claudia is now two months old and she is just amazing. She is so beautiful and sweet. It kind of makes me feel bad I never had any children of my own and probably never will. I chose to have a career and didn't really give much time to my personal relationships. But I absolutely love being an aunt. I have kept her on a few occasions so my brother and Jill can go out and get some much needed couple time. I do have to admit I like that I can have baby time then they pick her up and I have me time.,,3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R83I2T4O
