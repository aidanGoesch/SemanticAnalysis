Two months ago in May, my sister-in-law passed away. It was sudden and very tragic. She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate. It feels like I was just talking to her and planning our next get together. We'd planned to go to a concert with my brother and sister in July. I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February. She had been waiting to go that concert for years but hadn't been able to because our work schedules didn't line up. I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are. She'd been there for my wife and I through some hard times and was always willing to lend a hand to help us with the children. I can't believe that she's gone and I know that it's tougher on my wife. This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives. My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time. The funeral was difficult, but it was attended by so many people and my sister-in-law would've really been happy to know how many lives she touched when she was still here. I think that if anything good can come out of this is that we'll be more of a bonded family. We know that's what she would've wanted us to do and we'll honor her in this way. But I don't think I'll ever stop missing her.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G
