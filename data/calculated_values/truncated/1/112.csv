Seriously! Dad was paralyzed for over a decade. He had lost all hope and joy in his life. I can't blame him. I can't imagine myself being in that situation. I am quite sure i would have reacted the same way. Four months back his situation worsened. We were all informed that it was going to be over. I still remember the look on his face when he got the news. Lifeless. Motionless. Everything stopped. Doctors say that he was dead for 12 minutes. Is it a medical miracle or was it the power of Mom's prayers? I can't say. But he came back. Mom insisted it was Jesus, and surprisingly Dad agreed. Did he see something while he was dead? I don't know. He passed away a week from then. Hopefully he is at a better place now.",,3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1ABA3XK6
