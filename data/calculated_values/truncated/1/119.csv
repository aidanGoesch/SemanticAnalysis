It is on the new combat team at work. We Do different Drills and save people during 1 disasters. On this team i will be able to travel the country with friends that I have known for a very long time. A few of my childhood friends made the team as well and we are going to have so much fun together. To get on the team I had to pass a physical and mental exam. They made me run for hours and tested my 3 chest with a machine while I ran as well. I also had to take many test. I had never actually taken the one with the ink that you see on TV but i did this time. It was weird doing it in real life but felt fun. I also had to take a math and reading test.  After receiving the news that we were all accepted we went out for drinks. My friend met up with a girl he likes but we will see how that goes. I cannot wait until our next trip. I think we may do China this time around.",,37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZU7AAJ9
