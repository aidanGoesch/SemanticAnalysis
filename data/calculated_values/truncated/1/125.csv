I'm 24 now, and as I grew up, my family usually went on some type of trip each year, whether a smaller one for the weekend or a week-long vacation. This one was different though, both because it was my first vacation since moving out on my own as an adult, and because it's the first one I've gone on since my parents divorced. I grew up with my Stepdad, I don't remember a time before he was my acting father, and so it was just very strange to be going on a vacation without him. My brother didn't go either, so it was just a bit of a shock overall, I suppose. Everything was so different and I didn't expect to be so emotional, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking about how everything just felt wrong, lonely almost. From the activities we now couldn't afford to do on just my mom's salary (she wouldn't let me help pay), to how I just didn't have my brother to sit and talk to once the parents went to bed. He's close to my age, and we always used to have sort of a mini-vacation of our own on these trips, bonding in a way we never did at home. My mom, sister and I had a good time, maybe even a more relaxing one without the boys complaining, but I couldn't keep my mind off of how it just seems lately like my family fell apart. I know my parents never wanted that, but it's been a rough couple of years. I barely speak to my dad now, and sometimes it's just a painful reminder that I guess he never really was technically my dad. I spent a lot of time laying on the beach cabana, letting the sun warm my face while I just took it all in. I feel different since coming back, like maybe I developed a new understanding for things, maybe got a bit of peace about the situation. But I can't help but feel sad when I think about how my little sister is growing up in essentially a different family than me; she won't remember much of us all being together and happy. She'll have memories of going  back and forth to mom's house and dad's, and I hope she just finds stability in that somehow the way I'm struggling to find it in this situation, even as an adult.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9ASH5GFO
