The thoughts go out in my mind every time I think about it. Every few minutes this hurts even more. I really can't stop thinking about it and I use God to get away from it. For that hour or more in church, I am me again and don't think of anything else besides my love of God at the time and that is all. I hope one day I will have the power to stand up to my step father in prison and say I forgive him. I want it to happen but I know I need time. Time is of the essence because as he rots in there, I am free. He took my freedom from me for a bit but slowly i am getting it back. It is hard for me to get in relationships with everyone because of the emotional frustrations I am caused. Mr Smalling is the light in my life to help fight through the pain. He is a person I trust and can go to whenever I can. I really think about the good times when talking with him and how patient the man is. I will be healed one day but for now I fight the fight. Another day in the books and another day closer to being myself again. Bye Diary.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKJW1HA6
