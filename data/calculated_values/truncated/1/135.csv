I really, really hated it there. Every day was torture, and I was miserable. I had a 45-minute commute each way, and I had to work at a backwards Protestant college, which had me hiding beliefs if not telling outright lies to survive. I somewhat hid that I was Catholic, and I hid that I am liberal on a lot of economic issues. I had to not confront racism and bigotry. Students wrote papers about how Frederick Douglas was an agitator, and the LGBTQ+ community was vilified. I couldn't risk losing that job and not feed my family. I put all my energy in getting another job, and it was a struggle to care about something again. I did get out and started to be me the moment I got the offer. Now I am making a lot more money and have a better future. I cut my gas costs to a third of what it was. I have more than an extra hour now that my commute is shorter. I can even go home for lunch. I really feel I have left that place behind. I hardly even have any contact with anyone from that area any more.",3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1UIT50EO,
