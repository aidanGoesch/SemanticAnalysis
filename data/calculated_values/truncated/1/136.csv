I felt that it had been long enough to heal up a bit and start moving forward but it's still so hard.  I see their families trying to process things and move passed it.  I can't even get passed this, how can they possibly be doing it?  I know when i lost my sister i couldn't move for months.  literally couldn't get myself moving.  it was miserable.  i still have hard days, and it has been what....three years now.  Another friend of our family passed since i wrote my last entry.  she had a young daughter.  i've been seeing her pictures from christmas and new years.  surrounded by love but she'll never get her mommy back.  life is TOUGH.  She was really young and had a huge life ahead of her.  at least, she had plenty of years to watch and grow.  she died from drugs.  another young life taken because they wanted to have more fun.",3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943678MMU18,
