It was about a ten hour long car ride. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of road trips so a ten hour car ride is not that bad, or so we thought. His sister and her boyfriend seems like okay people to travel with, they were family so I was like why not. The first few hours were not to bad they were a little loud, almost like having children in the backseat. Then a couple more hours in to the trip their true colors started to show. They started to argue almost every second, which made the trip pretty miserable. They are also huge chain smokers so the ten hour trip gained a few hours due to the frequent stops and long stops for them to smoke their cigarettes. At every stop it would take them about thirty minutes to do their business. In the car it would just be moments of silence followed by yelling followed by making out. It was one of the most uncomfortable trips ever. At the wedding they got into more fights which only made the trip back home even worse. There was more fighting more yelling and due to their stress over arguing we needed to make more stops so that they could smoke even more. It was so uncomfortable, I could not even look to the back of the car because I did not want to see them either arguing with each other or making out. By the end of it I wanted to jump out of the car. Who knew that people in their twenty's could still act like teenagers.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,
