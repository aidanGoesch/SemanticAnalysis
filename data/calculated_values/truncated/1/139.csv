We used several different tactics/questions to figure out what to order for the couple, without them knowing anything.  It was fun picking out the food.  We talked to the concierge about having musicians come also.  We talked with them and discussed the type of music we were hoping to have as well.  We went to a bakery.  Had them prepare a special dessert.  It was personalized with their names.  We had stopped at a florist.  We obtained flowers to put on the table.  We did this prior to the couple's arrival time.  Everything was in place and went smoothly.  We watched for a few minutes in the beginning.  We saw that she was extremely surprised and happy, which was the goal.  We were also to take several pictures from where we were hiding.",31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DLPYY,
