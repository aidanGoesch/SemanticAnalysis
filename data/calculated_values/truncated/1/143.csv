I lived in the USA, and she lived in the Philippines. We made plans to meet up together and to start a life together. When the time was right, and I had lots of cash saved up and a passive flow of income, it was time to go there to the Philippines and meet for the first time. I was so excited. She seemed so excited also. She made plans for us to meet at the airport when I got off the plane. We were going to go out to eat with her family, and I was going to drop her off at her home, and go find a hotel to stay at for a couple nights. We were going to go find an apartment together the next week after spending more time together in person. We knew each other very well, or so I thought. We had been together for almost 5 years, talked everyday on skype and messenger. She kept track of my flight as I was flying, and we talked when I was able to. When I finally landed in the Philippines, got my luggage, got through customs, and immigration, I didn't see anyone. I looked and looked, and didn't see her. Her messages stopped, I tried to call her and she didn't answer for a long while. When she finally did answer, she told me she was sorry she could not come to the airport, and to just go find a hotel and we would meet up the next day. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and found a hotel. The next day, she called me and told me we could not meet up that day. She never gave me an answer as to why. Her friend, her cousin, and brother called me to break the bad news to me that she had a new boyfriend, and was pregnant. That's why she didn't want to meet. I ask her if it was true. She said it was, and was upset at them for telling me.",36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J707KY7,
