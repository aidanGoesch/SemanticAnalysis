My fiance envisioned me as his future wife and laid out all his feelings about me. He asked for my parent's hand in marriage and everyone did a great job keeping it hidden from me. I felt very special and like the most beautiful woman in the world by my man.  Following after his proposal I immediately told those closest to me including my best friend who recently got married. I told her now it is her turn to become a bridesmaid. Everyone around us expressed s o much joy regarding upcoming nuptials. At the moment I am halfway done with my wedding planning, the bridesmaids and flower girls have their dresses picked out, the venue where the ceremony and reception will take place.  I am buying decorations, looking for a photographer, for the event, including the type of food/drinks served. I am very excited yet nervous for our wedding to happen. We also  snapped engagement photos shorty after the proposal. My fiance has helped me get things done on his end I am so happy and grateful marrying my best friend and partner. He brings so much joy in my life and he makes me feel the same way the first time we fell in love. The love never went away and hope it stays that way forever. I can't wait to call him my husband in the near future.",39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGE67YYF4,
