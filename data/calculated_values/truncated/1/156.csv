I had NOT been feeling well the last several months so I didn't think that I would be able to finish the race.   I started off very slowly and I felt bad as the race started.  There were several moments where I considered dropping out.   At about 1/3rd of the way through, my stomach was hurting and I felt nauseated.   However, I kept telling myself that if I could find a good pace, I might be able to complete the entire race.   For the next 1/3rd of the race, I found a good pace but I also knew that I wasn't pushing myself.   For the final 1/3rd of the race, I seemed to find a sudden burst of energy and I started running faster and faster.   I actually passed a number of participants that had previously been in front of me.   I felt as if I had found my second wind and I continued to push myself as hard as I could for that last portion of the race.  When I crossed the finish line, I felt elated that I had completed as I wasn't even sure if I was going to be able to complete the race.   I felt very emotional when I finished as I knew that my health had not been the best in the previous months and being able to complete this race felt like I was conquering my health restrictions.   I felt as if I proven to myself that I could persevere and will myself to finish.   At the finish line, I shared my joy and excitement with several other friends who had also run the same race with me.   I also decided to remember this event for future times when I feel as if I want to quit or stop.   I know that perseverance and grit are important characteristics to possess and I believe that improved myself in these areas as a result of this experience.",3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7QQFNRM8,
