I had to go to HRA the end of September to get help with paying my rent. What i have learned is, even if times are rough and you are going through something, do not leave you job so fast. This has been a very hard time for me, catching up with my bills. I was able to get snap (food stamps) but I would very  much prefer getting back to work. I find myself spending more money then accumulating it. In order to get help with my rent by HRA, I had to got to this place called America Works, It's suppose to help you or equip you with the skills to get  a job, and to recognize the areas you need a little push in. I was lucky enough to be able to absorb some of the information, revamp my resume, and hope I find a great company to work for. So since the incident of me leaving the job. I have been reflecting on how I can improve myself. I have been listening to people who have conquered the things I am trying to get through. I have learned that I need to leave toxic people alone. People that don't have my best interest at heart. I also learned maybe it's time for me to go back to school. Come Monday, I am looking at a free training course to become a Medical Assistant. Wish me luck!",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFR8PDDOT,
