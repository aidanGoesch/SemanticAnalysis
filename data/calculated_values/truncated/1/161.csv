It was hard because of my disabilities but I managed to get through it. I worked hard and studied a lot. I almost gave up in the middle of it but I pushed through remembering why I was doing it in the first place. To be a working member of society instead of feeling sorry for myself with my disabilities. Even if my disabilities become too much of a problem at least I could be proud of finishing college. Finishing college has always been a dream of mine. Even finishing the first semester would have been enough for me a long time ago. However,  after getting high grades the first semester I knew for sure I could pursue this dream entirely. I had understanding professors. Which helped a lot. The subjects weren't too hard. I am now in my second semester and it's become a little harder but a little easier too since I've learned so many studying habits from the previous semester. I think this experience has made me grow as a person very much. I am lookig forward to what happens next.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDCJPDE7,
