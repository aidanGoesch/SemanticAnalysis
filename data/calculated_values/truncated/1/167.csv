My brother wife woke up early to use the toilet. I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. I heard her screamed and i rushed straight to the bath room. She already broke her bottle. She was ready to deliver. My brother also rushed in to confirm what was happening. We quickly prepared for the hospital. My brother was already shaking. We got into be car  and drove straight to the hospital. Immediately we got there, the nurses attended to us. She was taken to the labor room and after some minutes, the doctor came out to congratulate my brother. It was a boy. I was so excited.
