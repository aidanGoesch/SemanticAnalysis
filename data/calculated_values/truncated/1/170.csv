It took place on a breezy and cool May afternoon.  It was a beautiful ceremony attended by friends and family.  There were tears shed as they gave their vows.  Afterward, there was a nice assortment of food served.  I was able to enjoy some of the best burnt ends I had ever had.  The wedding cake also tasted great.  It was was made by one of the brides who has great cooking skills.  As for the women, they are very happy right now.  They both work hard at their jobs.  They also love each other very much.  Their relationship feels like a template and a good example to follow.  They get along very well and are able to communicate.  They also play well off each other in conversations.  Overall I'm happy that they found each other.  I hope I'm able to find something like that in my future.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,
