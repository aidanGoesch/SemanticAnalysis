We had left from our home that morning ready to embark on a two week vacation which would take us from Portland to Seattle to Vancouver. Upon arrival to Portland, we got our baggage from baggage claim and ordered a Lyft. Our Lyft driver picked us up, and we directed him to our hotel in downtown Portland. Once we told our driver where our hotel was located, he informed us of the protest that was occurring near our hotel. He informed us that liberal protesters, members of a group named Anti-Fa, and members of Gay Pride groups were violently protesting near where we were staying. He assured us that this was normal for Portland. After our Lyft driver dropped us off we entered into our hotel and walked to the front desk. The front desk attendant reiterated the ongoing protests. My Wife and I got to our room, and opened the windows in time to see trucks carrying officers from the Department of Homeland Security speeding down the street toward the protests. News stations on the television were also covering the protests. Later my Wife and I left the hotel, in another Lyft in the opposite direction from the protests. By the evening the protesters had left. The very next morning, My Wife and I walked to the site of the protests, and it looked as if nothing had happened. We ate our breakfast from a food truck, sitting the in the very square where the protests had occurred only hours before.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QT3XJF3,
