I thought I did something wrong and was going to be reprimanded. The auditorium had balloons and lots of decoration. There were managers and directors from our head offices. I wished they had sent me an email regarding what the event was about. I remembered quite well, how my heart was pounding. Eventually I was called at the podium.  I was then told of my promotion. Everyone congratulated me on the hard work that I have done. I was overwhelmed and immediately thanked my lucky stars. A promotion like that was well earned and my salary would be increased.  I am looking forward to seeing HR. I would like to know the percentage of my salary increase. I made the company proud and I am very eager to represent the company. They had lots of refreshments as well.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFILG12J,
