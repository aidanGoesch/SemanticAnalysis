We went out for a romantic dinner at our favorite restaurant then came back to our house to have drinks and spend time with each other.  This one was special because we hit 18 years, and they weren't all easy, but we always stuck by each other's side. This was something that we were both looking forward to for weeks, mainly due to our busy schedules.  My wife and I both work full time, plus we have 3 kids, 2 who play multiple sports.  With all of this going on we never get date nights, even though we talk about them.  We never have time to get away and just have alone time.  We got to the restaurant, sat down, and put in our drink order.  We were instantly transformed back to the kids we were when we first fell in love.  I starred into my wife eyes and tried to say things to make her smile.  I love making my wife laugh, we sat there making each other giggle and reminiscing until our food came.  Afterwards we stayed a bit longer after paying the check, then went home a had a few more drinks, hanging out and laughing.  We get very few date nights and I always look forward to them.  Our anniversary is definitely something that can't get put off, so it's a time when no matter what comes up we make time for each other.  We made a goal to not make these nights wait for our once a year date, we need to take time for ourselves and our relationship more frequently.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRBIUTJD,
