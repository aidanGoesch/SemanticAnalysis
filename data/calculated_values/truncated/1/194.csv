We enjoyed the flames licking at the logs and the warmth spreading out from the fire. We made smores and had a few drinks, spending most of our time just talking laughing and joking about life. At my house I have motion sensor lights. One night when we were sitting in the back yard around the bonfire one of the motion sensor lights kept going on and off. The odd thing about this was that it had never acted that way before. Talk around the bonfire went to ghosts and spirits, we joked that there may be a ghost trying to get our attention. Laughingly she said ""We see that you are here and recognize your presence."" After that the light did not go on again. This was something that we both found interesting, it's like she acknowledged whatever was going on and it was happy to be acknowledged it. The night was uneventful after that but it was the topic of conversation for the next few days, even though we had bonfires after that, we didn't experience that situation for any of those other bonfires. The other thing we enjoyed tremendously was going to Ren Fest. It was hot and humid that day but we both dressed as different Steam Punk characters. There were so many different things to look at and enjoy, we got to experience the fire whip, the jousting and the comedy troop. We spent hours just going through the different shops, enjoying the wares that were sold. And the food, don't get me going on the turkey legs, we spent so much time stuffing our faces with the different specialty foods that when we came home we both joked we would need too go on a diet. The sights, sounds and flavors that assaulted our senses were something that I will never forget.",3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC,
