He could hear hissing behind a board. He came in to tell me what was going on and I told him to leave whatever it was alone and bring the dog in. Well, as it turns it out, it was a small kitten. Later, when he let the dog out, he went crazy again. Again, my son went to check what was going on. The kitten did not take the opportunity to leave when the dog was inside. So, my son decided to help this kitten, he removed the board the kitten was hiding behind and pick up the cat. Once the dog saw the cat, he went crazy again. This spooked the kitten and it clawed up and bit my son. My son came inside with cat scratches all over, including a deep one on his lip, and had a rather deep puncture bite wound on his hand. We went to the ER, my son ended up on powerful antibiotics and a few stitches in face. The kitten was captured and sent for quarantine and testing for rabies. Not long after, my son's lymph nodes in his groin area started swelling. We went to the urgent care and they put him on antibiotics. The lymph nodes did not go down, but instead more started swelling.  Our regular doctor put him on a second, more powerful antibiotics. That didn't help and now lymph nodes in his neck started swelling. Doctor sent him for an ultrasound and the lymph nodes were extremely swollen and it was recommended to get a CT from waist to neck. Lymph nodes from groin to neck were all swollen. Our doctor told us he was 85% certain he had cancer. Not just cancer, but an extremely aggressive cancer. The surgeon removed the first, extremely large lymph node and told us it didn't not look like cancer, that he thought it was cat scratch fever, but we had to wait for the results. Our regular doctor was still certain it was cancer. Turns out my son had a massive case cat scratch fever.",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXALB4X,
