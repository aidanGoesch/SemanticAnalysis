We are still very close and have kept in touch. Her first husband died. I was so happy she found another great guy. When she asked me to be a bridesmaid I was so excited! I spent the whole weekend with her getting ready. We had such a good time! We went to get our nails done and have massages. We went out to eat with her family and the rest of the bridal party. I met some new friends and had a great time. The day of the wedding was actually a lot of fun. The pictures were beautiful and we had fun doing them. It was pretty relaxed getting ready. The wedding itself was beautiful. I read some scripture at the wedding. Afterwards the reception was so much fun! The food was wonderful. We had a lot of fun at a photo booth as well.,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K,
