My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side. That's how I'm dealing with the aftermath of my eviction currently.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,
