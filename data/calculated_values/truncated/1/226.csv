Our bodies are wonderfully designed with complex pathways designed to eliminate toxins. As apart of my self-learning, I began to research the supplement, alpha-lipoic acid. Convinced that this supplement could be beneficial, I began taking this common supplement. If one believes the hype, one could expect miraculous improvements in one's health if detoxification is impaired.  Upon taking the supplement, I noticed unexpected physical responses that were not in line with improvement in health. This caused me to dig deeper into this supplement. In the process, I came across the knowledgeable scientist from Quicksilver Scientific, Dr. Christopher Shade. It was during one of his presentations that I learned how the body can have blocks in detoxification as a result of exposure to toxic mold. This surprising fact caused a light bulb to go off in my mind. I had personal experience with toxic mold exposure, and this fact led me to believe that my unexpectedly lackluster response to alpha-lipoic acid may be due to a mold-induced block in my own detoxification system. Thankfully, there are good strategies for dealing with this sort of block in detoxification, and products designed carefully and comprehensively to assist in maximizing activation and functioning on the detoxification system. I encourage any reader to explore the Quicksilver Scientific range of detox products, and especially the Push Catch System, as well as to take advantage of the available teaching resources and seminars presentations available online from Dr. Christopher Shade.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N,
