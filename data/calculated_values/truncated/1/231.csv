We were in our rental car and driving around the town of Brisbane. Brisbane is a fairly navigable city, but of course being from out-of-town tourists, we were bound to get lost.  We got lost and were very confused as to which way to go because we weren't used to international traffic signs. Also in the area we were in there weren't a lot of road signs navigating us back to major points of interest. I was exceedingly nervous as the area we were in didn't look very safe. I was driving and my mom was navigating us. I was getting more and more upset because it was getting late in the day. My mom kept telling me to call down but I couldn't. She finally told me to pull the car over and we were trading places. As She got into the driver's side, she actually drove off and left me there on the street corner! She figured out where to go and came back and got me, but I was completely freaked out by that point. My mom was cracking jokes and asking me if I really thought she would leave me there! I told her I was so out of my mind I didn't know what to think. I can laugh about it now but then I thought I was going to die.",3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7ESLZ2KV,
