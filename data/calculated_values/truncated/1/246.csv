We do not get to see these friends very much because they moved to Riverside a couple years ago.  It was great to be able to spend a three day weekend with them. I do miss them a lot. My kid really misses one of her best friends, their daughter.  We drove up to Perris Lake from where we live in Southern California. Let me remind you that was one of the hottest weekends there this summer.  I think the wind was the only thing that saved us from getting too hot.  It was nice to set up our tent, enjoy the lake, and enjoy a good campfire for a couple of nights. On our last night there on Sunday, there was a magical thunderstorm.  I say magical because you do not see many of them in that area of California.  We got a great lighting show, We got lucky with the rain not actually hitting us. I did stay up most of the night watching this with my husband and one of our friends.   We got to let the kids and us grown-ups enjoy the lake everyday. We got have to make great meals everyday.  We made a campfire every night and made Smores one of those nights.  I think I just enjoyed kicking back and relaxing before life got crazy with school starting that Tuesday.  I was happy that we made so many memories with this camping trip. It was a great ending to the summer.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZWXMNJO,
