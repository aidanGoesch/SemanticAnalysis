My husband sat on the one side because he was in the wedding ""unofficially"" and my daughter was one of the flower girls. During the ceremony, my son, who has autism, was being happy, making noise, being loud, but he also wanted to get down. My husband had him at the time. He happened to be sitting right behind the groom's father and step mother. My husband was trying to keep him entertained and get him to be quiet, but he's little so he didn't understand. The father and his wife kept giving side eye glances to my husband and son because they were annoyed. I tried to avoid the camera and go around to get my son because they were getting upset that they couldn't hear. I took my son to the back of the ceremony area where he couldn't annoy them anymore. He kept making noise and wanted to run around because he just didn't understand. I ended up missing a lot of the ceremony because I was busy entertaining my son and making sure he didn't run into the ceremony where they were filming. I guess I was surprised that someone could get that upset about a little boy making noise. He wasn't even crying, he was just having a good time. I was hurt that they could treat my son that way and that someone thought of him as an annoyance. I just felt bad for my child.",3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6K572CI,
