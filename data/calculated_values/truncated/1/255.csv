A former coworker, who I had a great working relationship with, reached out to me. She told me about how her new company was a leader in the industry. In addition, she mentioned how she was excelling in her current role with them and really enjoyed the work. She mentioned that I would be a great fit for an open position that they wanted to fill. This company was over 3,000 miles away from where I live. However, the most surprising thing is that they were willing to let me work remotely! This was definitely a surprise to me, especially since it is uncommon to have a full-time employee work remotely in this specific industry. I was shocked and extremely grateful for the opportunity. This experience was significant to me because it helped me be more grateful with my current circumstances. I also felt a closer bond to my former coworker and felt a sense of thanks, especially since she helped connect me to this position. I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me. I also learned about my specific feelings around work and my circumstances. I really need to reflect more and learn to count my blessings. We have limited time to live, and it is important for health and longevity to reflect on the good in life.",3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS5VZ9KZ,
