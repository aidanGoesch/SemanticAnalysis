After her very bad experience at the last dentist, where she had a severe syncope episode, she still needed the dental work done. She found a dentist who was much more expensive but/and more expensive. This dentist knew how to coax her through the process without terrifying her. He also was very wise and used the short acting milder numbing agent and Belle got through the procedure with no problems whatsoever. What a relief to her, me and the dental team. Now we just have to pay the bill. >__<  That was not the end of her issues however. Belle had recently landed a very good job, right after high school graduation. It had a starting wage of $15 an hour, which at 17 is fantastic, plus it had room for advancement, also great! She had had two jobs prior, a grocery checking job and a restaurant job, but she'd never worked a full 40 hour week. This proved to be a challenge. One week into the job, she started having syncope episodes at night before bed and during work.  We had to take her to her pediatrician which didn't look good, we felt, to her employer,  for her second week on the job.  Belle felt like she was going to die. We were actually scared that might happen, though I never let her know, how I was feeling, in this regard.",3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6,
