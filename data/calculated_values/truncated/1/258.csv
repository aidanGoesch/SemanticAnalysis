I honestly wish I could read what I wrote one more time because I know the pain has faded and I can talk about it without tearing up now. My boyfriend and I moved in together and he ended up being a person I hoped he wasnt. We'd already agreed we would end things after the summer and I wanted to have one last good day tpgether. I took acid and we were going to go to a museum, something we'd done before and I loved. Once we were outside he was clearly mad and started going off on me, yelling at me in the street. I was starting to peak and all I could see was the absurdity in this. Why was he so mad? What did this matter? I don't even remember what pissed him off, it was so stupid. I couldn't help it, I laughed. That made him furious and he grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me back to the car. I could think of nothing worse than an hour drive home with him yelling at me, then being trapped in an apartment in the suburbs with no where to go and him yelling at me. I shook free and said I wouldnt be going. He said he was going to force me, and I pointed out how bad that would look for him. So he left me in the city. I watched his snapchat location, while he texted me things about how horrible I was, and saw him drive off, leaving me alone in a low cut dress. I had no wallet, no friends in the area, just my phone. so I started to walk. I walked and just tried to look like I wasn't lost and about to sob. I wonder how strong those feelings felt now",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLNHG84Z,
