As I was laying in bed, I got a random message on Facebook Messenger. When I opened the message, I noticed it was from somebody that I didnâ€™t even know. The messages were very rude and racist threatening to kill me and my family. A few years before that, my dad was involved in a shooting (he is a police officer). The person that was messaging me was claiming to be the girlfriend of the guy that my father had shot and killed 3 years previously. I then proceeded to send a text message to my dad to ask him advice on what I should do. He advised me that I should call the police and put in a report. The police ended up showing up and  I put in a report, then we determined that the profile was a fake profile. I decided to do some investigating on my own and messaged a few people to see if they knew who owned the fake profile. Eventually, one of my friends confirmed that the owner of the profile was an old friend of ours. Then I called the police back up to give them the new information. A few days later, the kid that was sending me the threatening/racist messages was arrested on a domestic violence charge involving is father and ended up admitting to sending me the messages when questioned about it. He ended up getting my charge dropped, but he is currently in prison for probation violation on a robbery charge. This situation has stuck with me for the last few months and I think about it every day. The part that stuck with me the most is that he threatened to kill my 1 year old child.",,
