My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be. It was a rough couple of weeks but I'm glad we could get justice for Eric.",,
