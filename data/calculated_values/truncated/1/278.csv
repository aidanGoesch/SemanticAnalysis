My now husband has the ability to surprise me when I least expect it.  He proposed on the balcony of our backyard over the ocean looking at the sunset.  We have been renovating his house for quite a few years so it was a special time for him to propose.  We had actually been broken up for several weeks and we were just starting to talk again.   I wasn't expecting us to do much for my birthday, but when I got there after he asked me to dinner he took me up to the balcony and proposed.  After we engaged we decided that we want to get married in Washington DC. This was a special place for us since we had visited there the previous year.  We instilled in the services of an elopement company to help us with our wedding.  We decided not to take any of our family and elope.  They weren't too happy with us, but we wanted to get married (it was the second for him and third for me) so it was more special for it to just be us.  We got married at the DC War Memorial in Washington DC right behind the Washington Monument and next to the WWII Memorial.  It was a gorgeous venue. The government was shut down so we had the opportunity to get married at a monument without a lot of people around, which was amazing.  Our pictures were gorgeous.  It was snowing and it was freezing, but it made for such a memorable event.  I was super excited to be his wife.",,
