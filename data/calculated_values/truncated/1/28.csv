I just couldn't figure out the method I wanted to use. I mean, if I showed my face on you tube, I would have to consider my make up, what I wore, how I looked and my mannerisms. I thought by doing a podcast, I wouldn't need to worry about those things. I was right! I am surprised by how successful my podcast was. I wanted to discuss Implied racial bias and how it affects our police force. I also included the fire department on this. I don't think anyone else has done a podcast one this subject. I was frustrated by the bias I was seeing here. I mean, none of us can help the color or race we were born. SO why is this such a common issue? I really dived into it for the research I did. I could not believe some of the information I found. Getting ready to record the podcast was kind of exciting too. Figuring out what I needed, how to create the podcast and how to promote it. I really learned a lot.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO
