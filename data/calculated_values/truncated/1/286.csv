This was earlier this month of May. My son was a student of Washington State University. Earlier May, he graduated. His graduation day was a major ceremony for me and the family. We prepared for the graduation for almost a month. The graduation day served as a reunion for a lot of people. Since he grew up in Washington, a lot of friends were able to attend the ceremony. This was to my delight. I was also surprised at how far he has come in life. I know that I have been with him all the way, but this was still surprising ( similar to how surprising it is for parents as they watch their children grow). The day of the ceremony was pure delight. I was introduced to some of his college friends which was a bit shocking to me as he has always had a private and compartmentalized life. I also talked to his girlfriend, whom I had never met. It is necessary to understand why I was so happy. My son was depressed in high school, and had attempted to commit suicide. Seeing him graduate college was overwhelming and crazy for me. Seeing him overcome obstacles made be the happiest person on earth that day.",,
