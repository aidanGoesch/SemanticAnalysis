I feel that the most appropriate thing for you to do would be to call the bride and explain your situation, and offer to have them over or take them out when your situation improves. As far as pressure from your parents, unless they are providing you with the money to attend and the money to give the couple, they should let it rest. I would consider sending a card wishing them well. it was an nice experience i had ever. i wish them live long and happy. they both are made for each other. i had a great time in my lifetime. she is my bestie. we had lot of memories. we are childhood friends. she was very special to me. we are family friends. we always going outing together. we had good and bad memories. i am very happy. and proud to have a friend like this. it was very pleasure to share this. still we are very close to each other.",,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PKW8H8C
