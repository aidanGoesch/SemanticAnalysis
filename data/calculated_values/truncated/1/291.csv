We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her. I approached it like how my counselor told me to, and she said I have to realize that it may not go the way it is intended to, and she was right, and that is why it hurt all the more.",,
