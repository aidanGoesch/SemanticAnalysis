I was in the car with him and I was driving and this black male came running at my car on the passenger side with a gun at a stoplight. The windows were down and he stuck the gun in the car and told us to get out. My boyfriend Hunter said no and he stuck the gun in his face so he grabbed it and pulled down and got shot in the foot. I know this didn't happen exactly to me, but it has made a huge impact in my life. I have PTSD and I don't even feel comfortable being in the car that it happened in. My ears ring to this day and every loud noise freaks me out. I am still continuing to figure out parenting on my own while he's recovering. I never got to mentally heal or physically heal since it happened two weeks after I gave birth. Not having my boyfriend at home was really tough because I had to do all the feedings all the diaper changes, figure out a schedule and do all these things on my own while he was at the hospital. Now that he's home, my source of income is mTurk and it's stressful trying to do everything I can and still not make enough money to support a family of three. My boyfriend can't pick up my son without being in pain and it hurts me to see. Every time I close my eyes I can see the look on his face when the bullet hit him. The bullet was a hollow point and destroyed his foot. I suddenly had to become a nurse and get taught how to give him injections for the pain medication and learn how to change out his IV bag at home and change the dressings on his foot until it closed up. Being a young mother and now becoming a caregiver as well drains me. I am very depressed, very anxious, and losing hope. I don't sleep because I'm terrified that my boyfriend will stop breathing because he's in so much pain. And on top of that, being paranoid about my newborn son stop breathing in his sleep.",,
