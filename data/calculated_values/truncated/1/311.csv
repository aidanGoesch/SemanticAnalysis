Even though he is our second child, I felt many of the same emotions as when our older son was born almost five years ago. However, the circumstances were different enough that even though the experience overall was just as life-changing as I expected, it was more even in terms of emotional volatility. With our first son, we learned late in the process that he would have to be delivered early -- basically up to six weeks early, due to a spike in my wife's blood pressure. This made for a great deal of uncertainty. This time, we anticipated the baby to be induced early, and as such we were calmer throughout the process. Even so, the birthing process is a primal one, even for me, a spouse whose job is to provide support rather than actual physical labor. We went to the hospital at around 7 in the evening, expecting the process to take 24 hours or more as it had with our first child. Ultimately, however, our new baby was born healthy only about 12 hours later. There were some frustrating times during the labor. We did not have a proper ""labor bed"" because we had to switch rooms due to some non-functioning equipment in the initial room. The nurses did not notice this until my wife was about to deliver and it was too late to get a different bed. This made me slightly anxious, but I was calmed by the reassuring demeanor of the medical team. Prior to that, we managed to feel something -- anger -- that we had not expected. The doctors and nurses were very busy because of a full load of patients and multiple births happening at the same time. Because of that, the doctor who was supposed to come to our room to discuss pain relief options, including an epidural, arrived too late to have a meaningful impact on my wife's comfort level. In fact, his callous demeanor made us quite frustrated and upset. Ultimately, though, that faded into the background when our healthy baby boy was born.",,
