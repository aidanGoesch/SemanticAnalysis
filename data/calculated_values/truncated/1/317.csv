I have witnessed two seizures when he was with his mother, my daughter.  But I have never been his sole protector and advocate during one.  I have prayed that I would never see the day that I would be alone with him when one happened. But that day came. My husband and I went to their home to babysit so my daughter and son-in-law could go to an evening wedding of a friend.  As my grandson stood at the window waving goodbye to them, he turned slightly towards me and became rigid. I knew that he was about to go into a seizure. I laid him gently on the carpet and turned him onto his side. I told my husband to run outside and try to flag them down. I grabbed my cell phone to note what time the seizure began.  I made sure he was breathing. He jerked slightly for about a minute, and then his body relaxed and he gave a big sigh.  It was over. My husband had been able to stop them, and they all came in around that point. My grandson was very confused, and then became  sleepy, so my daughter held him for a long nap. I was very emotionally drained afterwards.  When someone has a seizure they are totally defenseless and helpless. My grandson's frailties and vulnerabilities was driven into me that evening.  It was a traumatizing event for me.   If someone near you has a seizure, you must act to help them. Get them safely to the ground, otherwise a fall could be very injurious or even fatal. Turn them to their side to keep the airway open. If they have been eating, clear the mouth. Note the time, and call for help if it goes over two minutes.",,
