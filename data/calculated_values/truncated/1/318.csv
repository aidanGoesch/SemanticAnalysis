On the 22nd I went to New York with my partner. They are going back to school at Cornell University and  I have been missing them dearly. But that is not all I have been pulled around by people who want to hire me to work for them, but end up telling me at the last minute that they are going with someone else. It happened with a job I was very excited about. I updated and designed my resume and cover letter for it and answered all of their questions and made it to the final round of the hiring process. They wanted to me to contact them after I talk to a seasonal job I was working at about whether they could accommodate me with having a full-time position as well. I did what they asked and contacted them only to wait two weeks to hear back and nothing. I had almost complete certainty that I had gotten the job so I had already out in my two weeks notice at one of the places I was working at. O guess I jumped the gun since after messaged the new job again did they finally get back to me saying that they were gonna go with other candidates. I was heart broken to be honest. I felt awful for a little bit. I felt like I was never gonna find the job of my dreams. I still kind of feel that way. But I can't let bad luck deter me from keep trying because if I am sad too long and accept what happens then maybe I could miss out on it.",,
