It has been 2 long weeks! I can't even believe how different life is without power. We have been hit with tons of hurricanes over the years. But when this hurricane hit we knew it was different. The wind was so strong I thought the house might blow down. The trees across the street were snapping. It was really scary.  After a few hours the power went out. We figured it would be back within a few hours. The next morning when we woke up the sun was shining but the power was still out. The power company said it could bee 7-10 days before it was restored! The entire area had been destroyed and the power lines had to be rebuilt. My neighbor was nice enough to leave a generator for us to use. We came home to find it in the driveway with a note attached. They didn't want all out food to go bad in the heat. It was really difficult not having power but the kindness of our neighbors and family really helped. When I woke up today and the power was back I did scream from happiness. It was a very long two weeks. But we survived!,,3WETL7AQWUUAU7G3J6NKKKTO0FV53Q
