My job had to cut back my hours, so income has been tight and I have been running a little behind on bills. I have good credit and have never needed to take out a loan before. I figured now may be a good time to try, so I can pay down my outstanding debt before it gets out of hand. I was very nervous to apply. It took me a few days to get up the strength to do so. But then... my application was denied. At first, I felt guilty. Worthless. Like a failure. After a while, I started to feel frustrated and helpless.
