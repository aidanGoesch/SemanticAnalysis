Last year, I decided to take my chances with dating websites, and see who was out there for women my age. I am a little unusual, in that I am a professional musician, and keep strange hours. I am also looking for someone who is not your run-of-the-mill person. After going on many dates with different people, and meeting mostly alcoholic ne'er-do-wells, I met a very interesting man who was a blues musician. We instantly were attracted to each other, and embarked on a 4.5-month-long, very passionate relationship. It just ended two and a half weeks ago, because he went back to his old girlfriend. I discovered that was his plan pretty much all along. I believed dating at my age would be easy, because I thought people would know what they want in life. What I found was that people have an inordinate amount of baggage, much more than they do in their 20s and 30s. Maybe I'll meet someone else; I sure hope so. Falling in love over 60 is rough. This is because you aren't sure it will ever happen again. I don't want to grow old alone. I believe I have a whole lot to offer someone.",,
