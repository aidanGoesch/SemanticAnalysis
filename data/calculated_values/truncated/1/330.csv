I took on a side job that lasted for over 3 nights. My side job included me planning and managing an exciting extra event  of the planned show. The event was organized to happen in different locations of the show area. In the locations there were settings made to surprise selected fans attending the show by deceiving them. One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.",,
