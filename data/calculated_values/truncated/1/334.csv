I was going shopping for a birthday present with my little cousin(she's 8). So we went in, and spent about 45 minutes just browsing around the store, trying to pick a toy that she would like. My little cousin wasn't sure which toy to pick, but I told her that it couldn't be more than 20 dollars. However, she insisted that she wanted this miniature action figure that was well beyond the price range we had agreed on. When I firmly told her no, she began throwing the biggest tantrum I had ever witnessed. She was crying her lungs out, and no matter what I did, there was no quieting her. Given that I detest when children do this, I forcefully grabbed her by her wrists and got her out of the store empty handed. Not only did she not get the toy she wanted, but I told her that she could forget about getting anything else. She looked at me with eyes of rage, and just stopped talking to me for a few days after that. My aunt wasn't particularly happy with the situation but she took my side that it was the best thing that I could've done. That doesn't mean that I felt happy by the outcome, but I think teaching kids at early age that throwing fits like those are not going to solve problems. A few days before her birthday, I went and had a serious talk with her explaining how what she did was wrong. She eventually apologized, and told her that if she still wanted a toy. She ended up just going for ice cream, saying that she didn't want anything else. Fortunately, her birthday was a success, and seemed quite happy for having all her family and friends with her. I did ended up buying her that toy that she wanted because I think she showed maturity when she apologized for what she did, and wanted to reward her for that.",,
