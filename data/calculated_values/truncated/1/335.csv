It is a time I look back on fondly, and many good memories were formed during that time. I went to the beach and I walked around, relaxed, and enjoyed the sites. The weather was not too hot and not too cold, there was also a nice breeze and the water was just right. I think the fact that I had enjoyed myself so much on that day signaled a sign of a good summer. There were a lot of fun things that happened on the beach. I played with my dog. We both went swimming and I laughed at the way he swam. I had also remembered to bring my fishing pole, as there is a dock there. I was not lucky enough to catch anything. However, I still appreciated the meditative atmosphere of the act of fishing in itself. Even though I was not able to catch anything, I still had plenty of various snacks and meals for my dog and I. The sunset at the beach was very beautiful. I enjoyed the wide array of colors, and the sounds of the birds as they wound down for the night. I left after dusk, and I did not encounter anyone there the whole day. I slept beautifully that night as I was plenty tired after a full days outing that I had just taken. I still think back on the day often and I plan to make it a yearly trip to enjoy and signal the beginning of summer.",,
