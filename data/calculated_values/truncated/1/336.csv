I think that I would like to talk about graduation day.  I have four daughters that I adopted from China. They are beautiful girls turning into beautiful and very special women.  As the school year for 2018-2019 was winding down, I was getting ready for my second daughter to graduate. This was an exciting time. She was very excited and could not wait to walk onto that stage. I was so proud of her. I couldn't contain myself. She exuded confidence and held her head up high.  She was always quite the go-getter. She signed up for many clubs and ran some of the clubs as well. She was always willing to help someone out and was liked by her teachers. I was proud of the way she carried herself. When she applied for college, she was accepted at every one she applied for. Of course she took the one that was at the top of her list. I write about graduation because right now I am getting ready to take her to college. She has had a jam-packed summer. She started her first real job and just completed it this week. She will always have that retail experience under her belt and will always be able to find a job in this field. If that wasn't enough, she took on a second part-time job as well. She also purchased most of the items for her dorm herself. Okay and if that's not enough, she has also accepted her first job at college. I digress. Watching her walk down the aisle at graduation was amazing.",,
