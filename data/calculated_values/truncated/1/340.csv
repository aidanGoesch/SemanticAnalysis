I was going to my brothers wedding i was so happy and excited for him.  I remember when he always talked about getting married.  This was such a big day for him to get married.  I remember going to the wedding which was in my parents back yard.  I remember my brother had a very big smile on his face since he was getting married.  It was a very great time for our family and friends to get together for this big event.  I remember my brother walking down the aile.  I remember shortly after the bride came down  the aile after him.  It was a very exciting time.  SHortly after the ring boy came down and this was very funny because he fell over.  The end of the story is that they finally said there vows and got married.  After my family met for food.  It was a very fun time to say the least.  Everyone seemed very happy on this day!,,
