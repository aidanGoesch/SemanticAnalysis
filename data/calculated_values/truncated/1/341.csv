It was a very emotional event, as it became clear to me that my life was going to change in many different ways.  In fact, it's changed in ways I didn't even realize until now!  When we exchanged vows, it became real and when we were united, I felt that my life belonged to someone else.  We understood that there would be difficult times, but there would also be joys.  I believe we're both strong enough to get through the rough times.  It was emotional seeing her walk down the aisle, knowing that she too was vowing to change her life forever to be with me.  With all our family and friends around, it was a major event in our lives.  The well-wishes and happy thoughts we received from people were very touching.  Seeing everyone come together for our special event was a moment I won't forget.  The excitement and jubilation of everyone was infectious.  The planning was difficult but it was all worth it on that special day.  I hope that we can keep that feeling going through the rest of our marriage.  I know that with the help of our family and friends, we will.  Our love will get us through.",,
