This was a sad moment because he always seemed to be strong. Kidney failure began a few years ago until they no longer worked without the help of a machine. The news totally shocking as we thought he had more time and also hoped he would recover without needing this machine.  Its bee a few months since he started this process and he has lost a lot of weight. It makes me really sad but I know this is all a part of life and I´m thankful we have the technology today to have him with us for many years to come. Its been several months of changes but in the end we will support him and be there for him with positivism and with a lot of energy as we know this will make him better. My siblings and I talked long about this and about the necessary course of action and we all agreed to be strong for my dad. We need to be there for him, help him with his medicine. My dad is stubborn and doesn’t like others to help him. We need to find a way to be there for him without triggering negative responses. Its been a couple of months filled with challenges. I think about all the families that have similar struggles some of them early on. I am happy to be with my dad, to have him with us. I hope he gets better and we will be with him every step of the way.",,
