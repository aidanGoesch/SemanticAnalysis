I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I had my family back together. The feelings I felt that whole day up until seeing him is just something I could never forget. He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish.",,
