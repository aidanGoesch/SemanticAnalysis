I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the ""sinner's prayer"" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except ""self help."" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this ""metamorphosis,"" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.",,
