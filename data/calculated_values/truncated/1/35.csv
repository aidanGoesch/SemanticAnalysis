I go to his place regularly on the weekends. Sometimes it's for specific get togethers and sometimes just to hang out for a bit, to grab a beer, watch sports on TV, etc. Among my circle of friends it's a regular meeting place for us so this BBQ was nothing out of the ordinary. I left my house for the 30 minute drive in the afternoon and made a couple of stops on the way to get some gas and then stop at the store for some food to cook and to get some beers. I wasn't more than a few blocks from his house on that Sunday afternoon and my car got T-boned. Another car came out of a driveway into a main road from my right side and plowed into me as I was driving under the speed limit at around 40 MPH. My car spun around in traffic due to the impact and by the time I got my bearings I found myself looking at an exploded air-bag, a crumpled front end and my engine steaming smoke. I was disoriented and sore and it took me some time to realize what happened. I ended up with a broken arm and a concussion from the impact. For the first time in my life I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. While things could have ended up much worse for me physically, it was still a scary incident and I ended up missing some work due to it. It turns out that the driver that hit me was uninsured and that ended up complicating things for me. My insurance took care of a lot of what I was covered for medically but my car was a total loss and the compensation I received for the damage wasn't enough to keep me form having to go into my own pocket for a replacement vehicle. Since the other driver wasn't insured, it wasn't surprising to me that I wasn't able to go after them for additional damages since they basically had no money or assets themselves. In addition to the physical pain I went through,  was a very frustrating experience that eventually caused me a lot of anger over the situation. I wanted more compensation for my troubles than I received and I didn't get justice.",,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC3J3WZ6S
