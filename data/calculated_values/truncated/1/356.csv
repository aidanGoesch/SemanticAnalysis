I was alone in a remote area of northern Wyoming and heard a terrifying sound at about 3AM.  I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!  I have never seen a mountain lion in the wild, and the sound that it was making that night was otherworldly, something I'll never forget.",,
