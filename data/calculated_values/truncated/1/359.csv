I used to stay in a basement area and it was really dirty and gross, and had lots of mold. The man upstairs who rented it to me was an alcoholic and he would play his music at stadium level volume and it was very awful to endure.  After almost a year of that, including being harassed non stop for not speaking Spanish, I was able to find another place in a different city away from the man and his awful habits. It only took a day to move out, since I do not have much stuff. I was able to move in with a friend, and my boyfriend and things are much better here. I have personal privacy now, whereas I did not before. I didn't even have a bedroom before in the basement. I had to sleep on the concrete floor with spiders and centipedes around. I hated it and I am glad I was able to move. I am not as depressed and anxious as I was before. I was always getting harassed by Hispanic people for being American and not speaking Spanish. There is no one here that harasses me now. I am currently trying to save up for my own place so that I do not have to deal with roommates ever again. It is very hard to find a place of your own in this economy.",,
