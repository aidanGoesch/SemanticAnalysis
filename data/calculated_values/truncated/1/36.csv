One of the residents of the halfway house he manages was harassed by an individual about bringing a service dog to the F.R.A. . This was terrible because he is one of the most vulnerable people in our fellowship and was made to feel less than and unwelcome. A then was given a statement by the person with the dog that went into great detail about the event. He had to leave because he was made to feel very, very uncomfortable. I told the manager that I would follow through. I realized the seriousness of the event. When my manager talked to the person doing the harassment , he minimized the encounter. He seems to have no idea of the wrong he committed. I was angry and at first wanted to sue. It was an open and shut case. There was nothing done right. t was disgusting. It was terrible and it was unlawful.",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJNC611R7
