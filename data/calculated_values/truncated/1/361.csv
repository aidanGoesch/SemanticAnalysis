Everyone in my department had an opportunity to participate in a contest. You had to come up with ways to make a new production line run more efficiently and also cost effective. There was about 12 people who entered the contest including myself. I didn’t really expect to win. I just tried my best to come up with good solutions. I worked on it in my free time for two weeks. Finally it was the day to see who won. There was going to be a first, second, and third place winner. Everyone in the department gathered in the break room for the announcement. card.  Finally they read the first place winner. It was me! I didn’t react at first because I didn’t think I heard it right. Then everyone looked at me and clapped. I couldn’t believe it. I was so shocked. I had to get in front of everyone and they gave me a $300 gift card. I didn’t know what to say. It was a great day for me. Everyone congratulated me.",,
