They were visiting from overseas so I was showing them around. We went to a place of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in San Pedro. The location is called Cabrillo Beach. There is a pier and a long jetty alongside it that leads to a lighthouse. It was a very dark night and you could see the lights of the port and the homes shimmering on the hillside, but it was so dark that you could not readily identify the people that were walking along the pier. As we were walking along the pier, I could see the bonfires on the nearby beach, it was a surreal look because of the contrast of color due to the darkness around us. There were occasional fireworks shooting off from a park above on the nearby hillside as well, it all gave me a surreal feeling, the colors clashed and really created a festival like atmosphere. I also saw the colors of the fishermen's lures on the water, people walking along the shore with the light from their phones visible, I heard music in the distance. It was a unique type of night. I would talk about the things going on with my family and how this was such a unique experience. The most memorable part however was when a large cruise ship came into harbor. It was off in the distance and got larger and larger until in entered the harbor. The various lights of the ship were glistening, it's reflection on the water lit up the whole area. As it came in I was able to see the passengers on the balconies waving, although we could not see each other I felt the human connection of all the people around me.",,
