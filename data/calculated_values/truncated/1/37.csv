She was the light of my life.  I thought we were soul mates.  The year that followed was wonderful.  We laughed, and had so much fun together.  I did not see the signs.  I assumed after she said yes , and excepted the ring, that I would have nothing to worry about ever again.  I believed she would be mind forever.  About six months in I noticed a few things were different. She seemed to be drifting away.  I felt like she didn't understand me anymore.  I shrugged it off as many of us do.  I assumed she was stressed.  She had a lot going on at work.  These are the red flags I shouldn't have ignored.",,3L4PIM1GQU20FXBP5YTDDFUX7E8YRY
