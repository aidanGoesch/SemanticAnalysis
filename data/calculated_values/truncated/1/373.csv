When I turned the key it was apparent this was not going to be a normal day as I was greeted with a ""rrrur rrurr"". After a few more futile key attempts I popped the hood and noticed corrosion on battery terminal. No big deal, I'll just remove the corrosion and will be good to go, which I did and I was, until the next day. To my frustration I was greeted with the same ""rrur rrur"" the following day. Again, popped hood took a look not really any new corrosion, but i thought maybe the inside of the terminal connectors needed cleaning. While removing said connector it broke, not good. The corrosion had weakened the metal causing it to be brittle. No big deal, i'll just go get a new connector, which I did. Installed new connector and all was well in the world again, or so i thought. Three days later was again greeted with the too familiar ""rrur rrur"" when attempting to start the car after walking out to said car with groceries. Had to get a jump and limped back home. Back to the drawing board trying to decipher the car code. Decided the cheaply made recently purchased battery terminal connector was the issue, so got a stronger and better made one. Unfortunately while in the process of replacing said connector a small cable from the battery was accidentlly severed. After replacing the connector we now had to trace the small cable back and replace that. Finally done with all! Until I went to start the vehicle and heard the frustrating ""rrur rrur"". Stumped, frustrated, angry, happy, sad, all emotions under the sun, finally decided to replace the battery (that was tested by a shop that said it was a little low but ok). After replacing the battery peace was once again restored to the kingdom! All told, 7 days to fix the issue. Why not take it to shop some may ask? That takes money and we had none. The end.",,
