This day was a crazy night for me. It was the first time I have ever been to V.I.P. at a club. It was about 4 months ago, my friend was throwing a party at a club downtown from where we stay. He hit me up and told me he was going to get V.I.P. ,for his birthday and buy two bottles. I was like okay, I'll be there. I chilled at the crib for the day and started to get prepared around 8pm. Left my crib around 9 30, and prepared to drive above the speed limit since I didn't want to be too late. As I'm driving, I play my favorite tracks to get me hyped for the club. The club was about 1 hour away from my crib. I get there around 11, due to traffic and park my car. Walk to spot and see 2 people I know. One of them was a friend who played on the basketball team with me and high school, so i shook his hand; the girl I knew from science class back in high school so, I gave her a hug. I waited in line for  about 15 minutes and got inside. The party was lit. So many beautiful woman around. I walked upstairs swerving through people since it was crowded to get to V.I.P. I gave my friend who was his birthday, shook his hand and said happy birthday bro. It was a crazy experience, girls where just walking up to me while I was in V.I.P. ,like I had money. I dance with them and we party all night. I got too drunk to the point that i threw up everywhere and had to leave early cause of it. I left the club and sat in my car until the drunkenness went away and drove home after that.",,
