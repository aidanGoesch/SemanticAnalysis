Being his best man was a great honor and I am very grateful that he chose me to be so. My brother has a number of really close friends who could have easily performed the duties of first man, but he chose me. The wedding was beautiful. Family and friends came from all over to be there. Amber, the bride, looked stunning and her bridesmaid's also. We rented a farmhouse next to a lake as the venue. The weather was perfect, which is a rare occurrence in the deep south. Not too hot and not too cold.  The only potential problem was me. I have a terrible fear of public speaking and the best man is required to do a lot of that. But it was my little brother's wedding. I had a duty and the great honor of being the best man. I could not fail him or let my anxiety rule the day. In this case, being the best man also afforded me the opportunity to be there for my family and little brother and to work on myself as a human being, conquering my anxiety about public speaking and rising to the occasion. I learned that most anxiety is anticipatory, and that once the speech has begun, things are easier. So the speech and toast went off without a hitch. Dylan, my brother was happy, and, most importantly, Amber, the bride, had a happy day.",,
