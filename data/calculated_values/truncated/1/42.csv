My friends were performing songs off of a new mixtape that they had just released. Everything was going well into a group of about 5 or 6 people rushed through the front door in a very aggressive way. I was sure what the problem was but it was enough to take the attention off of my friends. After careful observation, it dawned on me. One of the members of the group was the ex of one of my friends. They broke it off a few months prior and the ending wasn't pretty. I decided to take matters into my own hands and boo them out of the building. The crowd started to get into it as well with a few boo's of their own. Unfortunately, the group didn't care and continued to ruin the show. My friends were pissed and the concert was eventually shut down. I felt pretty bad. It upset me that there was nothing I could do about it. After we all went home, I received a call from an old friend in Brooklyn. He told me that every member of the group was arrested a few miles from the event for a DUI. I didn't mean to laugh but I couldn't help it. I told my friends and we all laughed together. I was relived. It was good to know what goes around, comes right back around.",,35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45UJMMN61
