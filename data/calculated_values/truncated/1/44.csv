I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge. I'm ready for what's to come and whatever life throws at me. I know it'll be a tough next couple of months and it's going to get even tougher until the next opportunity comes along, but I'm ready to fight with all I've got.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5UNNBIV
