It was and has been the most emotional part of my life; and one that I am still learning to deal with everyday.  My dad has always been a significant part of my life - he was not only my parent. but he was a friend, a mentor, and a kind-hearted person.  My dad was home on the morning he passed away with my mother and he had been outside doing yard work, which was strenuous for him, because he had a previous heart attack.  When he came inside, my dad experienced the heart attack and passed away within minutes in my mom's arms - we were surprised, shocked and confused.  As the ambulance arrived and my dad was transported to the emergency room, my sister and I were asked to come to see him immediately.  We said our goodbyes,prepared his funeral and it was gut-wrenching. My dad's funeral was not typical because in our culture, we invite friends and family up to talk about the significance my dad on had on their lives, which was very touching.  My dad not only had significance in my life, but in so many people around us.  As these past few months have gone by, I am still very much reminded of how great my dad is; in fact, I get random calls from family and friends just telling me that they are thinking of him.  A few months later, my sister got married and we felt our dad's presence that day in so many ways - a speech he was starting to write for the day that my mother finished off, birds flying overhead, and a song that randomly popped up! Tragedy has taught us to embrace the loving people around us and through time, we will heal. We are reminded everyday that our dad is in a good place and we are surrounded by his spirit. I miss my dad very much and pray that he stays with me each and everyday.",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1R8RLB87
