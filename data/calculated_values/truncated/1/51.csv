He was the best man I have ever met. Although he was not particularly fond of anniversaries, he was keen on celebrating our ten year anniversary. Three month ago, we had the best time of our lives (I can say it was sweeter than my wedding itself). We have been planning for weeks. I got a nice hall and got a decorator to make it colorful. We invited friends and family through word of mouth and on phone and everyone was eager to grace the occasion. On the d-day, he took me to a nice restaurant for breakfast. My sister later came in that day. He assisted with the cookies I was making. I already negotiated with a restaurant to supply us a nice meal. Around 4 pm, family and friends were welcomed with love genre songs to which everyone flowed. The elderly ones holding their spouse and swinging to all directions slowly. The younger ones eyeing each other and making advances. We watched from a corner as everything was unfolding. My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out. It was my turn to say something about my husband. I couldn't manage a minute before tears of joy started rolling down my cheeks. I was greatly overwhelmed by how awesome he has been in our first ten years together. We took the vows and everyone found their way home.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z88VZN
