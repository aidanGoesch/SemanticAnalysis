Because the process of submitting a proposal had taken place such a long time ago and because we had not heard anything from our publisher, my colleague and I felt certain that we would either have to re-submit the proposal to another publisher or abandon the project. We had spoken about the future of the project only a week or so before we were offered a contract. At the time, we were quite discouraged and planned to speak about our potential next steps shortly. Thus, when I opened the email, I was shocked. I immediately sent a message to my colleague who was travelling with her partner to share the good news. We were both very relieved and excited. Once we had had a chance to talk, we drafted a letter to the publisher expressing our gratitude. We also wrote to our contributors, thanking them for their patience. As we began to hear back from the publisher with details and from our contributors with excitement, I began to grow nervous. Though I had written several chapters for publication in similar volumes, this would be the first time I would also be editing the text. My nervousness and anxiety heightened my sense of excitement and I felt a new desire to work. What surprised me most was not hearing back from the publisher after having practically abandoned hope. Rather, it was the sense of renewed scholarly motivation that engulfed me that I found most surprising. Now, I am much more focused on my work. I feel grateful to enjoy this new energy, which has also carried over into my teaching as a general sense of purpose.",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2YE5T33
