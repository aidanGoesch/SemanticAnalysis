College didn't seem like an option. But I persevered. And I graduated. It was quite fun overall. Some definite stress, but knowing I was working on something with value made it worth it. I felt I got along with the student great. Even with my age. I liked all the instructors. The curriculum was proper and difficult where it needed to be. I felt it was very engaging courses. While I do miss it, I am glad I succeeded and am ready for the next stage in my life. I often joked with others that I was too old for it. But they laughed along with me and we all helped each other. I'll keep in touch with many.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZCNU7ZT
