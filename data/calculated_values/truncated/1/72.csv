Four and a half long, hard years and I can finally call myself a college graduate. The ceremony was weird, it felt different. I was expecting it to be like high school graduation; some bittersweet emotions, lots of crying, long huge. This was different. It felt transnational, like I was waiting in line at the bank. I think that's because in high school there's more to look forward to. ""I'm going to move out of my parents' house, make new friends and party every day for 4 years."" College graduation you're jut staring into the abyss. ""I need to find a job and work 40 hours a week otherwise I'm going to starve to death."" The stakes are high. Despite the fears, my friends and I were ready to take the plunge. We had our goodbyes and heart to hearts last night at Dave's house so there were fewer emotions today. We all promised to keep in touch, and I know a few of us will. A few of us brought our parents back to the house we rent. Grilled burgers and pasta salad is a far cry from the parties we used to trow there. I got to see my parents interact with my friends parents; immediately bonding and becoming friends with people they barely know. It made me confident that when I move away from this little insulated bubble of college life and enter the real world I can make my own friends and forge my own path.",,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K9EI37Z
