It was their 50th wedding anniversary. I haven't seen them for four years. It's been a very long time and I had missed them. We had a lot of catching up to do. So maybe the first few days there I didn't get much sleep. We had some of the best conversations parents could have with their children. I even had the chance to get a few pranks on them. During my time away I did a lot things like growing up and becoming I am today. I was really into making arts and crafts. So I made them a picture collage. It had pictures of my family when they were younger. I also framed it as a gift. After spending a bunch of time with them and having experienced things I haven't before it was time for the anniversary. The day of the anniversary we spent it together as a family and had a lovely time.,,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZCT8SVF
