I didn't see it coming.  I didn't imagine that it would happen so quickly.  One moment he was here, the next he was gone.  Seven months isn't very long, and my heart still feels broken into a million pieces.  People say that time will heal things, but at this point I don't know that I believe that saying.  Those million broken pieces of my heart seemed to have been scattered by some unknown wind and I have yet to find them.  I can only imagine what my mother must be feeling right now.  My father had suffered some strokes previous to this all deadly one.  But, he came through them before and was still his cheerful self.  However, the day this deadly stroke happened was awful. My mother was home with him and they were getting ready to go on vacation to Yellowstone.  My father was a nature enthusiast and loved getting away to places where he could be closer to nature.  He always told me that it made him feel at home and brought to his heart a peace like no other.  As they were packing for this trip, the deadliest of strokes slammed my father.  My mother noticed the symptoms of previous strokes, but this time they got worse.  She dialed 911 and the paramedics arrived.  They loaded him into the ambulance and rushed him away.  My mother was able to ride in the ambulance with him.  The paramedics worked furiously on him during that drive to the hospital, and then, silence.  He was gone.  The phone call came.  It was my mother.  Her voice was full of the deepest sorrow on earth as she told me that dad was gone.  My heart sunk, and broke, and tears flowed down my face like a never ending waterfall.",,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87K9OEMK
