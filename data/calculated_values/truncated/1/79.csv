Hard to believe it's been that long already. Time really does fly when you get older. Anyway, the wedding took place the beginning of June this year. They had planned to have a summer wedding since the beginning. They're both outdoors people so they love the warm weather. The day arrived and tons of my family flew in from around the US. I was kind of anxious to see everyone again. It's been years for some fo them. Luckily everyone gets along. We all arrived at the venue which was a really nice local garden. It was really impressive even from the very start. I was really impressed how much work they out into it! It was a wonderful day and I was so happy that everyone seemed really relaxed. Everyone seemed to be in a great mood and very friendly. The more casual vibes made it a great and enjoyable celebration of their union. I wish all weddings could be as enjoyable as this one was!",,3L6L49WXW1JVC3Z7JKS3UPLUF90549
