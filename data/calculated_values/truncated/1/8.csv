It was about six months ago, when I had her. It was a big blessing and I was so happy. I did not know if I could have the baby in a natural way. However, my husband was next to me all the while. This made the process so much easier. I was in pain, but his presence made it easy. He has always been a supporting rock. He held my hand through it. I pushed and pushed. The baby came out and she was so pretty. We named her Juju. This was a name of our good friend. She was happy and honored. We went home happy with our new bundle of joy. We love getting her in our arms.",,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4CFHWVJG
