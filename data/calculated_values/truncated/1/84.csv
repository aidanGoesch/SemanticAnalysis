We did everything together! We dated twin brothers, we went to the same college. We were so close, we even moved into the same house together. As soon as I got a boyfriend after college, we started to fade away from each other's lives. I wish that we had kept in contact, but people drift away. I was shocked when my now husband asked me ""Didn't you know Janet?"" and I said ""Man, Janet! Yes! Why?"" and he told me that she had passed away. I was shocked! I went to her funeral and talked to old friends of ours. They started talking about how we all went for coffee and donuts before it became a huge fad with teens. After the funeral, I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a dozen donuts and a large coffee. I sat in the parking lot eating and crying. I wish I could say that that was the only time I did that. It wasn't. I did this every week for months. Sometimes, when I got really sad, I'd do it multiple times. In 3 months, I gained 25 pounds. I knew I had to get a hold of myself. I ended up just getting a donut and a small coffee and eventually cut it down to none of them.",,323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLBGF4HFF
