I was working on a big project and spilled coffee all over my computer. My computer stopped working. None of the normal tricks would restart it. Everything was lost. I had just started a new job and really needed that computer in order to work. I did not have much money saved up because I had not gotten my first paycheck. It was super embarrassing, but I decided to reach out and ask my family for help. Luckily, my parents were able to help me. They gave me money that I needed to buy a new computer. They are always so loving and kind. I don't know what I would ever do without them there for me. I definitely would not have my job any more. I was able to get the perfect new computer. I was able to finish my project in time. I am always thankful that my parents could help. I hope to never be in this situation again. There's little chance I will. I've learned my lesson and keep the coffee far away. No way do I want to have to ask for money again!",,39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTGNSIU8
