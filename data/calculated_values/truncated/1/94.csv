It still doesn't feel totally real, but the amazing part is that I'm actually coming to terms with it a lot quicker than what I expected to. This woman was my hero. This woman helped raise me and steered me towards the direction of success. But lung cancer took her away from me. She was so stubborn though, and put up one heck of a fight. She tried her best to last as long as she could. She beat the odds every time it felt like and at times I thought she was simply invincible. Only way mom was going was kicking and screaming. I think the reason she held out for so long was because she felt like her family needed her. She wanted to make sure they were taken care of. She wanted us to feel safe, just as much as she had her entire life. Two months ago she felt safe with this knowledge and left for those big clouds in the sky. It does still sting. But I'm so proud of her, and I hope she's the same for me.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK
