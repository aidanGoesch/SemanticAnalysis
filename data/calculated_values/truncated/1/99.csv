Because i got better job in another state. It was very tough to relocate one state to another state. We have to change each and every small things to another place. Like we have to change our passport address, license address, and etc. But i have to change my location. Physically it was very hard to relocate with our things. and also financially it cost very much to our budget. But i can handle this situation very smart. at the end i was sell my home products and big things in my house to local mart. After i sell it i can get a enough and reasonable money. Then i relocate with small things. It was slightly easy than moving with lot of things. I can buy some new products in my new place. It could be less amount for transport charge.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EBB6WYU
