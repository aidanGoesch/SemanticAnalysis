He had just arrived in town from overseas to visit for the summer. The day after he arrived, we were driving to one of our favorite taco shops to have lunch. On the way there, we were driving through an intersection when another driver ran a red light. We were t-boned. The other driver hit us on the passenger side, where I was sitting.  Fortunately, no one was seriously injured. My brother's car, which he loves dearly and only gets a chance to drive when he comes to visit, had some body damage. The other driver's car took the worst of the damage. Its front end was badly damaged. I had hit my head on the door frame, so I went to the hospital to make sure I was okay. It turned out that I had a minor concussion. There were no complications, aside from a bad headache, some diziness, and a lot of soreness. All things considered, we are lucky that it was not worse. Unfortunately, I have a lot of anxiety about driving and riding in cars from past experiences. This event brought all of that back. I have been especially anxious while traveling in vehicles lately. I hope that sensation improves soon.",,3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA7JL95M,0.0

Two months ago my brother and his lovely wife gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and they name her Claudia after our great grandmother. I was so surprised when they told me they were going to have a baby. They tried for a long time and really had thought they would never be parents. So many times they had to go to the fertility clinic and they would get their hopes up just to be disappointed.  But finally our little miracle arrived. I was so proud of my brother and how he handles the birth of his child. I was lucky enough to be invited into the delivery room. It was really amazing to watch the birth of little Claudia and Jill my brothers wife was so brave. She really did a great job. Claudia is now two months old and she is just amazing. She is so beautiful and sweet. It kind of makes me feel bad I never had any children of my own and probably never will. I chose to have a career and didn't really give much time to my personal relationships. But I absolutely love being an aunt. I have kept her on a few occasions so my brother and Jill can go out and get some much needed couple time. I do have to admit I like that I can have baby time then they pick her up and I have me time.,,3YMTUJH0DT2XX5AXKGA1X5R83I2T4O,0.0

My job has been a total disappointment, I feel like I'm getting no where and my boss really treats me disrespectfully.  I am just working to get by and pay the bills. I've tried to figure out something I can do to help the community and also satisfy my budget needs.  After talking to a career counselor, I've decided to get my TEFL certification. I feel like this will make a big difference in my life.  I enrolled last month and am going to be starting my first class in a week. I am a little nervous to be making such a big change in my life, but I am optimistic that this will be a better change for me. The course will be taken at the Daytona State College which is not too far from my house.  I also think I may sign up for a couple of extra curricular activities.  Some of the groups include helping immigrants settle in their new lives in America. I will be helping to navigate around the city. Showing how to use the bus system and make local appointments and shop in the main stores in the area. I also get to help plan parties and celebration in honor of our new friends.  I am already feeling so much more positive and happy about my life. I hope I can really keep moving forward in life and fulfilling my needs to help and actually help people in return.",,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19M9PKD4Q,0.0

I suffer from clinical depression. It is difficult to put into words how deep and dark that place can be. Everything that I typically enjoy doing faded away. Food tasted less delicious. My interest in sports faded. It seemed as though the light had gone out of my world. The people I am closest to became less important to me. I didn't want to get out of bed in the morning. I would either sleep too little or too much. I couldn't find any semblance of peace or enjoyment in my life. I talked to my doctor and he increased the dosage of my medication. It took almost 3 months to pull out of that deep depression. To people that have not experienced depression, it is absolutely crippling. Mental health is a topic that is not well understood. People think you are ""just down"" or ""blue"" but it goes much deeper than that. By the beginning of August, I started to feel like myself again. Light had entered my life once again. The experience made me so thankful to be out of that dark place. I have experienced 4 other similar episodes in my life. The most recent depression was the worst of the 5. I am just thankful to have it behind me and I pray it is a long time until I am afflicted again.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPXE7Z42,0.0

I called immediately, and shocked to be told the test result indicate that my baby may have Downs Syndrome. While still trying to process that news, the doctors told me the best thing I could do is to terminate the pregnancy. I was stunned. How could this be? I have been taking meticulous care of health. I had no statistical markers for risk of have a Downs child. I cried for day, not knowing what to do. Finally, I asked the doctor's office to send the test results indicating this diagnosis. It turns out, the test I took was not even for Downs. There was no way for the doctor to make that determination. The stress of this situation caused me to go into labor 3 months early.

It was in the next town and I do not own a car so I had to take a very early bus. There was a bad ice storm that day and it took a lot longer than I expected to get there.  Since I was running late I did not have time to get anything to eat before the deposition. During the deposition I was asked a lot of questions about my memory of the events (which I do not want to get into too much detail) and they continually made me feel like a liar and incompetant. They kept on implying that I was a bad person and it was a big pain in the ass. Afterwords I had to catch another bus back and only had time to get a hot dog from a street vendor. It must have been a bad one because on the ride back I was throwing up the whole way.  Luckily a kind person in the next seat helped me and gave me water and some baby wipes to clean up with.  It was a horrible experience overall but could have been even worse without the kindness of that man. I have developed a hatred for busses.  I no longer feel so great about hot dogs either. MY advice to others would be to not trust street food, especially if you are already stressed out. The stomach can do nasty things to you if it is not treated well. Hopefully I will never go through that again.",,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS93IHQCX,0.0

Today I got my 60 day chip for being sober. I feel pretty good about the fact that I was able to get back on the wagon, but I'm also pretty disappointed in the fact that I fell off to begin with. I'd say that's 8 years wasted, down the drain, but my support group says that I need to consider that addiction is an illness that never actually subsides. It will always be there with you, so it's important to be weary of triggers for relapse, but I was still an addict for those 8 years so it's not that I've failed. As you know, a year ago, my mother passed away. After she passed, her house was seized by the bank and that's where I had been living while I try to get my life in order. Karen came to the funeral and when I told her about my issues, she said she had just the thing to pick me up. I shouldn't have been hanging out with her to begin with, but with the passing of my mom, it seemed like she just wanted to reminisce about the good old days and I was really feeling the nostalgia. So, I went to the party with her and in my desperation, started drinking while we were there. It was a wild night, and I really wasn't in a good head space. I ended up passing out on the uber ride home and she had to practically carry me to my bathroom. We tipped the uber pretty well. I woke up on the bathroom floor and immediately regretted my night, but thought.. 'to hell with it' and went to the liquor store right away and stocked up. I drank for about 3 days straight thinking I'd be able to get back on the wagon myself, but those few days of acceptance led to months of acceptance and I found myself at work trying to hide my vodka in a water bottle. When my brother came to visit, he noticed all of the empty bottle in the trash and convinced me to take a week off and go to a rehab facility. I agreed and my time there was nice, they really helped me understand my triggers and forgive myself while taking responsibility for my actions. Since my release, I've been going to AA meetings and tonight I got my 60 day chip. I'm confident in my progress but I am still a little ashamed of the fact that I fell so far off the wagon after 8 years. I'm hoping things will get better with my new job and apartment.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5PHEIX,0.0

I have finally graduated from college and received a Bachelors degree in Accounting.  It took me five long years to complete that degree. Two years in community college and another three years in the CSU system. I had to fight hard for all the classes as registration filled out very quickly on enrollment dates.  For the first time I was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. All my hard work paid off and I can finally say I have a accomplished one of my biggest goal. It was my graduation year and I felt very happy about it. My family and friends showed up to celebrate my big accomplishment. My significant other also came along to celebrate such a big event. They brought me thoughtful gifts and colorful flowers. We went to dinner with the whole family. They showered me with love and appreciation, which is what mattered the most.

We absolutely loved it. The building, inside and out, is beautiful, classy, and impressive. The woman we met with that gave us our tour was excited, personable, and relatable, and she answered our questions easily as we walked through the venue. The history of the place is magnificent, and the view of the mountains and river out the windows of the spaces were breathtaking. We loved everything about it, except the bathrooms. When we asked about the bathrooms that would be available to our guests she told us they would have to use the ones in the lobby of the hotel. It was fairly far from the rest of the spaces, but not an insurmountable problem. When we used these bathrooms after our tour though there was a problem. They were so tiny! It was difficult for me, a larger guy, to close the stall door behind me. There was no way a group of 100+ people would be able to use only those bathrooms. We bumped into our tour guide and asked about other options and she said she would get back to us about using the bathrooms on the level below the lobby, via elevator. We weren't really satisfied with this but continued looking around. We happened upon some super nice and roomy bathrooms as we were walking around the 2nd floor and realized they were just as close as the lobby bathrooms to our event space! Only a short walk and up a flight of stairs, or one could take the elevator. While still not overly convenient, it was certainly a better solution than the lobby bathrooms. I recently went back and visited again with my fiance's parent and sister to show them the venue and work out the nitty gritty details. We are very excited.",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHP2XDPL,0.0

His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.",,3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,0.0

I was boiling water with my hiking stove to prepare oatmeal for breakfast. A gust of wind blew over the windscreen set up around the stove and toppled the pot of water off of the stove. The water was forced out of the pot and onto my abdomen. Fortunately, I had cell service and called 911. I was instructed to put cold water on the burn while I waited for the ambulance to arrive, but the only thing I had available was a cold bottle of Gatorade. I held the cold bottle to my abdomen while the dispatcher was trying to figure out exactly where I was located. My call had hit a cell tower in a different county. It took the ambulance 30 minutes to get to me and another 30 minutes to get me to the hospital. The wait seemed like an eternity, and I was feeling the worst pain I ever felt in my life. The emergency department doctor told me I had second and third degree burns over 45 percent of my abdomen. I passed out immediately after they gave me a shot of morphine. When I woke up, I no longer felt pain. They put a special ointment on my burn that totally relieved the pain. I needed to get back to my campsite, where my vehicle was located. The hospital called a taxi for me, and I was sent back to my primitive campsite. I felt very weak and could not pack my camping gear into my vehicle, so I ended up sleeping in my hammock. I spent two days in that hammock, trying to get the strength for the two and a half hour drive home. When I finally arrived home, I had to go to another emergency room to have my burn cleaned. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life, and I am still recovering from my burn both physically and emotionally.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZBZOVS9,0.0

I had always been big into cars and spent a lot of time going to car shows with my dad. Once I had my first full time job and paid off my student loans, I had my eyes set on an Audi A3. It really was my dream car. After saving and being thrifty for a few months, I felt comfortable enough to take the leap and buy the car. I was so excited with it, I wanted to drive it everywhere every singe day. I had the great idea of taking it on a road trip with some friends, to really break it in. So 6 months ago we set off from Cape Cod and decided to drive up to Vermont for a nice weekend in the wilderness. The four of us got into my new Audi A3 and hit the road,a  big smile on our faces. The car drove like a dream. It was responsive, fast, and incredibly smooth. The several hours drive simply flew by, with each of us taking a small shift. We all agreed that this was one of the best cars we ever drove. I left the road trip that weekend happy as can be. Not only did I have an awesome weekend away with friends, but I had my dream car. I could not be happier.",,34HJIJKLP6ICAXEMPBAGYNFT90O4VO,0.0

They reported to my location almost immediately. I was able to call my family, but I couldn't speak so they couldn't get told til a paramedic arrived. They hauled me to the hospital where they luckily got me taken care of. My whole family was there which made the process a lot better.

When I got good grades, she always joked that I had copied someone. I was doing okay on all the subjects she didn’t teach me. I blame myself for not doing anything and not talking to the dean the second time she made me fail. On my last practical test, I went to take the test soon after I had been involved in an accident. An old woman who could barely walk rear ended me when I was getting out of the parking lot. Should people this old even be allowed to drive? When I got to the testing center late, that evil woman refused to even listen to me. She completely ignored me when I asked if I could be tested on another day.

I wasn't expecting much, honestly, because we are not rich by any means and usually birthdays are a pretty simple affair. After a delicious home-cooked dinner, my husband and I were just about to dig into some cake when he slipped away to our bedroom to receive a wrapped gift. I was already so surprised, since we don't typically do gifts. He looked so excited giving it to me, I couldn't help but tear into it. Inside I found concert tickets! This was really thrilling because we haven't been out to see anything live in years and I've been dreaming of doing something just like this. What really got me, though, was when I noticed that the tickets were to go see Paul McCartney! The Beatles (and Paul) have honestly always been my favorite since I was a child, but I never imagined I'd go and see one of them live. I was so touched, and my husband just had the cutest smile on his face. I didn't want to say anything, but I know that the tickets must have been pretty expensive and it would have taken him a long time to save up for them. I just think it's one of the sweetest things he has ever done for me. The next night we went out for dinner before catching the show and the whole thing was just a dream. We had so much fun and I felt ten years younger! We danced and sang along together, and when we went home we both couldn't stop talking about how great the show had been. I don't think I will ever forget this birthday, it was such a delight.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J5E8JIDA,0.0

Also all the ingredients were easy to obtain. I immediately saved the page and made the list. I proceeded to go to the store for the items. The ingredient list was simple and short. I was more shocked that the total cost was less than expected. I carefully followed the instructions and made a batch. I was surprised at how well it turned out.

I was a bit nervous about it and around March I received my first acceptance from UC Riverside.  I was excited that at least one college accepted me for I had some doubts that any would.  But over the course of the next month and a half, it seems like my whole life changed.  I ended up getting acceptance letters from every UC school, including Berkeley and UCLA.  I remember when I got my acceptance to UCLA, I was sitting in a quiet study room so I couldn't really react loudly.  But I definitely started to reflect on the hard work it took and what I'd been through to get there.  I feel like I beat the odds making it to this point.  I was definitely emotional as I'm a first generation college student and my parents were proud that I had gotten into such good schools.  After the fact I feel like my whole life has changed for the better and I have so much ahead of me.  I believe I had no reason to doubt myself in the first place and realize now that that was irrational.  I am definitely looking forward to it all.

It was memorable and something that I think about often, especially when I go into any other caves and desire to explore passages that are a little tight. Getting stuck in a cave, even thought it was only for about 30 minutes was somewhat terrifying when I think of it. Though I tried to keep my cool and I knew that I would be rescued since there was a large group of people with me, it still makes me think twice every time I see a tight spot in any cave.  With that being said, it began like any other caving trip in Florida, going through various squeezes and crawls into new areas that I have never been before. I followed my friends all the way to the furthest back room that I could reach; they could all fit through without much trouble, and I only had to exhale a little bit to fit through. The back room was interesting, don’t get me wrong, but it was not worth what came next. I tried to fit back through the small opening that I came in through, but going headfirst at such an angle was not going to be the easiest. Seeing another route out that everyone else was going through made me also think that I could just crawl headfirst through that short passage. While I could get my chest and upper body through with no problem, that is where I ran into the problem. My hips just would not fit through! I called to the guys that were with me, who thought I was just joking and soon realized I was not. They pulled my arms to help and I was stuck in tight! They were making slow progress, but it was steady progress. Inch by inch I was able to wiggle my hips while they pulled my arms till finally I got out! It seemed like 30 minutes total, but it was probably much less in real time. After getting out my muscles were shaking all over, but was I ever thankful to get out of the beautiful and somewhat terrifying cave!",,3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CHK8HTL,0.0

My girlfriend, and I went to the Columbus Zoo about a month ago. It happened to be one of the hottest days recorded in July in the city! We had been planning this trip for weeks, so despite the weather, we decided to stick to our plans. Ashley and I have been working on spending more time together as we both work full-time jobs that prevent us from having date nights. More recently, I have been asked to work overtime on weekends, but this weekend I knew it would be more beneficial to spend time with her. We got to the zoo early before many of the large groups came and grabbed a snack from the snack bar so we could get a head start on seeing our favorite animals. Ashley really enjoyed seeing the elephants and giraffes, while I wanted to see the tigers and lions. The giraffes were running around playing with their young babies who looked as if they had just learned to walk. We were really lucky to see the penguins who were out swimming in the afternoon, but not for very long. It looked like they had gotten full from all of the fish they were being fed and went back into their private area to nap. I couldn't blame them for that! It felt like a much needed day together with my girlfriend. It meant a lot to me personally, as I have been stressed at work and Ashley finds a way to get me talk about some of the things I've been holding in. It was truly a wonderful experience. What was really neat is that the zoo offered free lemonade to their guests once the temperature got above 95 degrees. Ashley must have had a gallon of lemonade that day! I think Ashley had a great time also, as she talked about the animals on the entire drive back home.",,304SM51WA4QG34IRAVFYVE1S8XNSBV,0.0

It was a 7-days Caribbean cruise. I was so excited to go! The only thing I was worried about was leaving my cat Cornelius at home. I have made arrangements for my neighbor Mary to check on him every day. She is such a sweet lady and she agreed to do it right away. She promised she would make sure that Cornelius has fresh water and food and she told me there was nothing for me to worry about. So, I went on the cruise and it was amazing. I didn't have internet access nor phone service, which was great, but I was a little nervous, because I couldn't check on Cornelius. I had the feeling that something bad might happen to him, but my friend kept telling me that I shouldn't worry that much. But I was right. Something did happen while I was away. Apparently, there was a leak under my bathroom sink and Mary reported it to the landlord. He stopped by my apartment later that day and repaired the leak, but left a hole under the bathroom sink. After he left, Cornelius, being the curious kitty he is, went into the hole to investigate it and got stuck in it. I don't know how much time he spent in that dirty dark hole, but Mary realized that he must've went inside when she didn't find him in my apartment the next day. Long story short, Mary had to call the landlord and her nephew and it took them the whole afternoon to rescue Cornelius, but thankfully they did it and he is ok.",,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGONI772OH,0.0

This was a big deal because I have not spoken nor seen my father in over 10 years. The last time we spoke, we were not on the best of speaking terms due to some differences we had when I was still living in the same area that we had. I was pretty stunned that he had even called me and wanted to do something with me. Even more, he had invited my girlfriend of 6 years who he had never met. I never gave him a direct answer during the first call because I was shocked. I wanted to talk it over with my girlfriend and my therapist to see if this was even a good idea. I was slightly worried that it could conjure up some past animosity that I have harbored since I was a kid. Both my girlfriend and therapist said I should definitely follow up with my dad and agree on the trip. The next several weeks were very nerve wracking for me and I could not stop thinking about how the trip would go. When we finally met up in Cheyenne, Wyoming, my emotions were all over the place. I was so nervous my stomach hurt. My dad gave me a hug and said he was excited to ""get the show on the road"".  We had a great trip and talked for hours each day while driving to a new destination in the park to check out. My dad and I rekindled our relationship and it was a week that I will never forget. I now finally feel like I have a father and it makes me feel happy.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQS3UYV,0.0

My second wedding to my most wonderful husband ever.. our 10th anniversary.  Maybe people think I should have waited another 10 years but there are key people in my life I wanted to witness us renew our vows and as morbid it may sound, possibly will not be with us another ten years. Added addition to the ceremony is  our lovely 6 year old daughter who were our flower girl. I bought a simple, yet pretty gown and my husband got a tailored made suit. Our daughter got the prettiest dress ever and we set the date over the winter on the beach in our local city, Miami.  The ceremony was beautiful and my husband and I expressed our love to each other and the blessing,m our daughter we have created. We had a small gathering following the ceremony in our backyard where our guests can mingle. Everyone goes to our home and good food, music, and drinks is  served. The open bar was a hit, maybe too much of it as few of the guests, including my husband got sloppy drunk. While others danced with drunk(ness) on the dance floor, including my husband, one, my ""lovely"" uncle step it up a notch and started to flirt with other women, while aunt is present and gotten rowdy. I was somewhat embarrassed and my aunt came to me to say she will handle it and taken my inebriated uncle outside to calm down. Luckily all this transpired shortly after my daughter went inside the house  with a older cousin whom we asked to babysit my daughter. Aside from my husband who could not remember half of the night and my crazy uncle who had to sleep away his liquor, overall the wedding was beautiful and everyone enjoyed themselves. I got another chance to celebrate my 10th wedding anniversary and once again fall in love with husband. That night also serves a reminder why I am once pregnant again months later.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLY7GNOVC,0.0

I couldn't stop talking about my son to everyone I know. Even my friends got bored of listening to talk about him all the time, the joy of fatherhood was just overwhelming. After about two years, my wife and I were advised by some friends to start potty training. We didn't have any idea on what to do, as he was our was first child. We decided to talk my parents to get some tips on how to go about. Once we were about to start potty training him, we made a time-table, which mostly based on when at first it was fun.  We thought everything was going great, we were having fun introducing the potty to him and demonstrating when he is supposed to use the potty. After the first week there was no improvement, we still were highly motivated to keep going, as were still had other methods and processes to try. After two more weeks it became clear that he was not improving in anyway, no matter the process we tried, even when we tried rewarding him he still did not improve. My wife and I then decided to go online for some updated information about potty training, because at that point we were already frustrated. We found some information which we applied. After the application and there was some slight improvement, but it was far from the main goal. We finally caved after about two months and we had to higher a professional. Hiring the professional was not cheap, but we had to make the sacrifice, also we were already emotionally exhausted. After about two weeks of hiring the professional there was some significant improvement. Till today we still wonder what we did wrong.",,3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ8BTZQ00,0.0

He was so very liked by many people.  His down to earth and jovial personality will certainly be missed.  The rumor was confirmed to us by his wife and family and everyone at worked was sad to hear the news.  We did get together and reminisce about all the good time we had together; including giving him grief about his beloved sports team. We got news of the funeral.  It was not too surprising to hear that the funeral will be informal.  In fact, we heard that we would be encourage to wear jerseys of his favorite sports team.  This took some of us by surprise. We wanted to show a formal amount of respect.  But I guess this is the way he wanted it.  It was nice to see everyone show up wearing sport jersey.  Not everyone joined in on the informal attire.  I think they felt uncomfortably overdressed.  Ha ha ha, John was probably laughing in the casket! The ceremony was nice.  We all paid our respects during the ceremony and at the grave site.  Afterwards we were all invited to a reception at a local sports bar.  Here, we all told our stories of John and the experiences we had with him.  Although there was much laughter, there was also some somber moments.  I for one will remember all the good times I had with John.  I will miss him dearly. The following week at work, a number of us talked about Johns service.  We filled in some people who were unable to attend.  Our management decided to have one day a month where we could wear our sports jerseys.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY78SVH0J,0.0

Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. I was felt some pain in the armpits or breast that does not change with the monthly cycle. Also pitting or redness of the skin of the breast, similar to the surface of an orange. A rash around or on one of the nipples and discharge from a nipple, possibly containing blood. So I confirmed that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor will check the breasts for lumps and other symptoms. Several tests can help detect breast cancer as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The main treatment are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy, or targeted drug therapy, hormone therapy. But  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment. If surgery is necessary, the type will depend on both the diagnosis and individual preference. A lumpectomy can help prevent the spread of the cancer. This may be an option if the tumor is small and easy to separate from its surrounding tissue.  A simple mastectomy involves removing the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, nipple, areola, and some skin. In some types, a surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes and muscle in the chest wall. A person may undergo radiation therapy around a month after surgery. Radiation involves targeting the tumor with controlled doses of radiation that kill any remaining cancer cells. A doctor may prescribe cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells if there is a high risk of recurrence or spread. When a person has chemotherapy after surgery, doctors call it adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes, a doctor may choose to administer chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor and make its removal easier. Doctors call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The entire process was very exhausting and emotional draining.",,3WI0P0II62EXHMGY926Z0UKWR9KDRR,0.0

It was only about 1200 square feet and three bedrooms. We were very close. But about three years ago, my parents took out a second mortgage on the home. They had been nearly done paying for the house. The original monthly payment was just $600 a month. Unheard of anymore. But with the second mortgage, it quickly ballooned to $2000 a month. My parents tried, but they just could not keep up. The house went into foreclosure and about three months ago, we were evicted. At 18 years old, I'd lost everything I ever knew. My brother and sister, just 17 and 19 respectively, also lost everything.  We were all now homeless. We went our own separate ways. I found a place to stay with some friends. As did my brother. My sister moved in with her boyfriend. Mom and dad disappeared on us. It was the darkest period of my life.",,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9LS2V91,0.0

My husband had been applying to many different jobs. The one he had was not really cutting it for our finances, and money was really tight. We found that we were spending more money each month than we were earning. It was a very stressful time for us. My husband found a great job that paid almost three times his previous salary. He also got a signing bonus that allowed us to put down a down payment for a larger vehicle. We had to take two cars to get our whole family somewhere, and now we can all fit in our (new to us) van! We bought a 2012 Honda Odyssey and the color is a gorgeous deep red. We got a really good deal on it, and while I never really wanted a minivan, I'm glad that everyone can finally fit in one car. I was surprised how much I loved it! We were also able to catch up on our electricity and gas bills. We weren't behind a whole bunch but it was refreshing to finally be able to reach a balance of zero! It is so refreshing to be able to pay the bills. We have some money saved up now to get the kids some great gifts for Christmas. We won't be taking our newly found financial freedom for granted. I plan on being frugal with my household purchases and contributing to a large emergency fund.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A18S0UFV,0.0

We figured it would be back within a few hours. The next morning when we woke up the sun was shining but the power was still out. The power company said it could bee 7-10 days before it was restored! The entire area had been destroyed and the power lines had to be rebuilt. My neighbor was nice enough to leave a generator for us to use. We came home to find it in the driveway with a note attached.

I go to his place regularly on the weekends. Sometimes it's for specific get togethers and sometimes just to hang out for a bit, to grab a beer, watch sports on TV, etc. Among my circle of friends it's a regular meeting place for us so this BBQ was nothing out of the ordinary. I left my house for the 30 minute drive in the afternoon and made a couple of stops on the way to get some gas and then stop at the store for some food to cook and to get some beers. I wasn't more than a few blocks from his house on that Sunday afternoon and my car got T-boned. Another car came out of a driveway into a main road from my right side and plowed into me as I was driving under the speed limit at around 40 MPH. My car spun around in traffic due to the impact and by the time I got my bearings I found myself looking at an exploded air-bag, a crumpled front end and my engine steaming smoke. I was disoriented and sore and it took me some time to realize what happened. I ended up with a broken arm and a concussion from the impact. For the first time in my life I had to be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. While things could have ended up much worse for me physically, it was still a scary incident and I ended up missing some work due to it. It turns out that the driver that hit me was uninsured and that ended up complicating things for me. My insurance took care of a lot of what I was covered for medically but my car was a total loss and the compensation I received for the damage wasn't enough to keep me form having to go into my own pocket for a replacement vehicle. Since the other driver wasn't insured, it wasn't surprising to me that I wasn't able to go after them for additional damages since they basically had no money or assets themselves. In addition to the physical pain I went through,  was a very frustrating experience that eventually caused me a lot of anger over the situation. I wanted more compensation for my troubles than I received and I didn't get justice.",,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC3J3WZ6S,0.0

Also, it has been awhile since I had seen some in my family. The fact that I had fun at the wedding made it memorable. Also catching up with some family members made it memorable. The wedding was significant to everyone in my family. Especially to my sister of course. This significance was also something that made it more memorable. The reception was of course more memorable then the ceremony. This is because the ceremony was pretty standard. Therefore it was easy to forget. The reception however was fun and unique.

I didn't have all the details but they're getting on in years and going back to Jamaica. They were incredibly nice to my family since they moved in, so I'm going to miss them. And had some misgivings about the new people, you know because it meant another black family leaving the neighborhood and another rich yuppie couple coming to further gentrify. Plus there's the fact that there's basically not space between our houses, it can get a little too intimate. It turned out though that my new neighbor is Cara, my very first ""girlfriend."" That's what I called it, but we were 3 or four. I played around with her in her place or my backyard, and for a while, probably until she moved away we exchanged Christmas gifts every year. It was a cute relationship. She lived next door probably until I was 10 or so, I should have put it together sooner that she's related to the Parkers. This was pre-social media so we just completely lost touch. We're connected on Linkedin now though. She's a web developer, just like me, so we had a bunch to talk about. She's got a kid now, a toddler, but I didn't notice a ring when we talked. And she's looking pretty good these days. It was great catching up with her, and it'll be cool to actually get to know her as an adult. We'll see what happens.",,30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7BBFDHWQ,0.0

I'm sure they don't know the depths of how miserable they've made me over time because my feelings never really mattered to them. They liked to put on a facade that they cared about me, but their actions always told a different story. They were both heavily into drug abuse for as long as I can remember. Always thinking they're keeping me in the shadows of their activities and discussions. They're trying to ""protect"" me from that world and that life they were leading they'd tell me. ""Why should I care? We've never been close."" I'd tell that lie to myself almost every day to try to push down the feelings of love that were still buried somewhere deep down. Over the years it's always been the same story. I try to help them both in any way I can. I would preach for hours and give them advice on how to move forward and break out of the kind of life they were in. I'd set them up for success just to see them fall back into the same routine they've always had. They never wanted to get better. I see that now. ""We're family after all. We have to look after each other no matter what."" The event that ended my abusive relationship is when I gave them a place to stay when they had nowhere else to go and they ended up stealing from me. That day just broke me. After everything I've done for them over the years how could they do that? I saw clearly for the first time. This isn't what family is.

My friends were performing songs off of a new mixtape that they had just released. Everything was going well into a group of about 5 or 6 people rushed through the front door in a very aggressive way. I was sure what the problem was but it was enough to take the attention off of my friends. After careful observation, it dawned on me. One of the members of the group was the ex of one of my friends. They broke it off a few months prior and the ending wasn't pretty. I decided to take matters into my own hands and boo them out of the building. The crowd started to get into it as well with a few boo's of their own. Unfortunately, the group didn't care and continued to ruin the show. My friends were pissed and the concert was eventually shut down. I felt pretty bad. It upset me that there was nothing I could do about it. After we all went home, I received a call from an old friend in Brooklyn. He told me that every member of the group was arrested a few miles from the event for a DUI. I didn't mean to laugh but I couldn't help it. I told my friends and we all laughed together. I was relived.

I asked ""What kind of things?"" and the hotel clerk said ""Just footsteps, laughing, ghost noises."" I laughed and ignored that. I don't believe in ghosts so whatever. That night, I was laying in bed after taking a shower and had just turned the tv off. I got comfy and started to doze off when I heard a ball bouncing. I opened my eyes and the noise stopped. I flipped over and saw nothing so I assumed it was my imagination. I closed my eyes again and hear a child laughing and the ball bouncing again. I sat up and turned the light on.

There are so many Ricardos - more than one hundred and fifty! - so I don't get to see many of my family members for years at a time. There are some family members I've only ever seen at our reunion, which we have every five years. But, every five years, every Ricardo, young and old, gets together at a big park in Wyoming. There are a few branches of the family living in Wyoming, and it's the easiest state for most of my family to travel to, so that's why we always hold it there. Everyone brings lots of food - tons of Ricardo home cooking! It always seems like, somehow, everyone leaves with more leftovers than they initially brought to the reunion. The youngest Ricardo is my cousin Jimmy; he's about six months old now, but he was only three months at the time of the reunion! In a few weeks, there'll be a new youngest Ricardo - with a family this big, ""the baby of the family"" isn't the baby for very long. The oldest Ricardo is my great-grandmother Rosa. She turned ninety-eight years old right before the reunion! She has so much family knowledge stored in her little old brain. Tons of Ricardo family recipes, stories, and it seems like, somehow, she has the entire family tree memorized. At the reunion, the kids ran around the park and played while the parents chatted and caught up. We all ate a big meal together at the picnic tables under some trees. Afterwards, we all gathered around great-grandmother Rosa. She always spends hours at every reunion telling us old stories. It was a wonderful reunion, and I was so glad to get to spend time with my great-grandma! Ninety-eight is a long time to live, but she keeps surprising us! I can't wait to listen to more of her stories at the next reunion, when she'll be one hundred and three years old!",,31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDSW0I5I,0.0

It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge. I'm ready for what's to come and whatever life throws at me. I know it'll be a tough next couple of months and it's going to get even tougher until the next opportunity comes along, but I'm ready to fight with all I've got.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5UNNBIV,0.0

It was and has been the most emotional part of my life; and one that I am still learning to deal with everyday.  My dad has always been a significant part of my life - he was not only my parent. but he was a friend, a mentor, and a kind-hearted person.  My dad was home on the morning he passed away with my mother and he had been outside doing yard work, which was strenuous for him, because he had a previous heart attack.  When he came inside, my dad experienced the heart attack and passed away within minutes in my mom's arms - we were surprised, shocked and confused.  As the ambulance arrived and my dad was transported to the emergency room, my sister and I were asked to come to see him immediately.  We said our goodbyes,prepared his funeral and it was gut-wrenching. My dad's funeral was not typical because in our culture, we invite friends and family up to talk about the significance my dad on had on their lives, which was very touching.  My dad not only had significance in my life, but in so many people around us.  As these past few months have gone by, I am still very much reminded of how great my dad is; in fact, I get random calls from family and friends just telling me that they are thinking of him.  A few months later, my sister got married and we felt our dad's presence that day in so many ways - a speech he was starting to write for the day that my mother finished off, birds flying overhead, and a song that randomly popped up! Tragedy has taught us to embrace the loving people around us and through time, we will heal. We are reminded everyday that our dad is in a good place and we are surrounded by his spirit. I miss my dad very much and pray that he stays with me each and everyday.",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1R8RLB87,0.0

I did not sleep at during the night, I tried but I could not. My girlfriend has been away for three days now, I have been calling her in vain, her phone rings and she sends me straight to voicemail. I scratched my head several times those past few days wondering what I did wrong so I could apologize but I could not place my finger on anything, I tried to assume that being Easter Holidays she must have traveled to her home town. But why did she not tell me? Anyway, I got up and showered quickly and went and picked up my friend and on the way to the hospital he could tell something was off. I decided to open up since we rarely kept anything from each other, I told him how we had spent Christmas together with my girlfriend, for the first time I did not go home to my parents home to celebrate because I wanted to spend it with her, this was also her idea, she did not have to convince me much to do it, I was in love. My friend felt disappointed, he tried to encourage me to just hang in there and everything will be work out for the greater good, this sounded like Greek to me at this point, I just wanted her back. Halfway to the hospital she called, I asked her to call me back in hour after I had checked my friend in the hospital and was free to talk. My heart was racing all the way to the hospital, anxious of what she was about to tell me, were we breaking up? where was she?. Questions and all sorts of reasoning clouded my mind and I could not wait to hear what she had to say. Finally, I was free to call back. I dialed her number and an unfamiliar male voice picked up the phone, I apologized and hang up assuming I had dialed a wrong number, I tried again and got the same voice, I tried to contain my composure and asked him if I could speak to my girlfriend, his answer ripped my heart in a million little pieces! He calmly told me ""his"" fiance was on holiday and he did not appreciate me calling her all the time. I am safely back home now. I just have to rest my head and my heart! It has been a long and stressful day and there is nothing I can do to forget about it. I just hope that tomorrow when I wake I will be level headed and start my healing and moving on journey. I do not know whether I will have the strength or the courage to fight for this love. Only time will tell, I highly doubt it though. Matters of the heart are very complex, no matter what age one is. All in all, life has to go on and I have to keep my head high, I will try however hard it is. Maybe next time I will love with my head and not my head, there could have been red flags but I was too blind to see.",,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2S31727E,0.0

She had the biggest house ever I thought it was a mansion; six bedrooms two an half bath, a swimming pool, a game/movie. We had so much fun and bonding in there. We go hiking in the mountains, catching fish on the rivers nearby and we have had so much activities there. It was so unforgettable.  We were so happy with my family.  It was really a blast for me.

We invited friends and family through word of mouth and on phone and everyone was eager to grace the occasion. On the d-day, he took me to a nice restaurant for breakfast. My sister later came in that day. He assisted with the cookies I was making. I already negotiated with a restaurant to supply us a nice meal. Around 4 pm, family and friends were welcomed with love genre songs to which everyone flowed. The elderly ones holding their spouse and swinging to all directions slowly. The younger ones eyeing each other and making advances. We watched from a corner as everything was unfolding. My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out. It was my turn to say something about my husband. I couldn't manage a minute before tears of joy started rolling down my cheeks. I was greatly overwhelmed by how awesome he has been in our first ten years together. We took the vows and everyone found their way home.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z88VZN,0.0

Thus, when I opened the email, I was shocked. I immediately sent a message to my colleague who was travelling with her partner to share the good news. We were both very relieved and excited. Once we had had a chance to talk, we drafted a letter to the publisher expressing our gratitude. We also wrote to our contributors, thanking them for their patience. As we began to hear back from the publisher with details and from our contributors with excitement, I began to grow nervous. Though I had written several chapters for publication in similar volumes, this would be the first time I would also be editing the text. My nervousness and anxiety heightened my sense of excitement and I felt a new desire to work. What surprised me most was not hearing back from the publisher after having practically abandoned hope. Rather, it was the sense of renewed scholarly motivation that engulfed me that I found most surprising. Now, I am much more focused on my work. I feel grateful to enjoy this new energy, which has also carried over into my teaching as a general sense of purpose.",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2YE5T33,0.0

I had broken one of my molars while I was asleep, and the pain was so bad it was radiating through my jaw. To make it worse, it was the weekend, so there were no dentist's offices open near me. The pain only got worse through the day until I was curled up in a ball with my eyes squeezed shut. I finally found some Aleve and took it, which relieved the pain enough that I was able to think straight. Still, I couldn't manage to do much that day, I couldn't bear to eat, and I couldn't sleep that night. The next morning, I went to the dentist as soon as they opened and asked if they could fit me in. I didn't expect much - perhaps some painkillers until I could make an appointment - but they were shockingly nice and understanding, and the receptionist had me sign in for an emergency appointment right away. The dentist examined me, said I would need a root canal and a crown, and offered to fit me in that morning. I was amazed at their willingness and ability to fit me in, especially after the last dentist I had been to where I was always waiting for an hour at minimum and treated more like a problem than a patient, so I jumped at the chance. I paid for the root canal, he numbed me, and I spent the next two hours getting the gentlest and most careful dental care I'd ever gotten in my life. The discomfort was minimal, the dentist and the hygienist helping him were friendly and frequently making sure I was alright, and the procedure went smoothly without delay, even though I was a last-minute patient. I was so stunned at how nice and conscientious they were without sacrificing efficiency in their work. I'd never been to a dentist like that before, and I'd honestly been dreading going to a dentist because I was waiting to be scolded or shamed for my tooth problems like previous dentists had done to me. Between their kind treatment, the horrible pain being gone, and how tired and loopy I was from not eating or sleeping, I was almost in tears thanking them when they were done. I made an appointment to get fitted for my crown and walked out feeling relieved and uplifted, which was the last thing I expected to feel after a root canal. It was obviously expensive, but it was worth every penny.",,3F1567XTNXRL2VOHK7CX98R1EYJ9QN,0.0

I didn't have the chance to really until just recently. About four months ago I took the plunge. I decided to visit a friend who I had known for a while and felt comfortable flying across the Atlantic for. I traveled from the US all the way to London, England. Traveling this distance was a bit nerve-wracking, but at no point did the nerves outweigh the excitement I had for this event. I seriously just was so excited and I couldn't imagine backing out now. After a lengthy flight, I met the friend and even though I had nerves meeting them too, I was still really excited to hang out with them. I wanted to hang out with them for a long time. I just couldn't believe it was happening. When we met, it was exciting and fresh and new. I couldn't believe I was so fortunate to be in the position that I was in. I got to see all of the sights, experience the food, and just spend some time in a culture that is different than mine. I encourage everyone to go through this if they can. It's an experience not soon forgotten.",,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GQ91UDJ,0.0

A guy parked his car in a disabled spot and got out to go in to the store.  At the same time a lady pulled up next to him and shouted to him out of the car window.

The lady was disabled and was asking him to do so as she needed the spot.  The guy ran in to the store and the woman waited for him.  By the time he came out she was, understandably irate.  He just lost it and started calling her all sorts of horrible names which related to her being unable to walk.  It was just unreal to see such anger and hate in the world.  I decided at that point had to intervene.  I got out of my car and walked over toward where they were arguing.  I sided with the lady, of course.  I couldn't keep my emotions in check though!

For an all-ages show, guests of all ages are welcome with an admission ticket. Children age 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult. Most of the concerts at the House of Blues Orlando are general admission. General admission means that there's no reserved seats in the audience; in fact, on the main concert floor, there are no seats at all. Concert-goers simply stand wherever they can. There are a few seats around the perimeter of the floor Located 4.9 miles from the Orange County Convention Center, House of Blues accommodates 15 to 2,500 guests, and our talented staff handles every detail, so you don't have to! On any given day, guest attire ranges from business suits and dresses to fashionable jeans and t-shirts. House of Blues would like to thank you for not wearing tank tops, sleeveless shirts (men only), gym wear or casual shorts, which are not permitted in the Foundation Room. Dress shorts are acceptable. Disney Springs. Disney Springs (previously known as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village in 1975, Walt Disney World Village in 1977, Disney Village Marketplace in 1989, and Downtown Disney in 1997) is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near OrlandoGigs usually last between 2 and 3 hours, it depends how many supports there are and how quick at setting up they are in between. Most gigs with doors of 6.30 start between 7 and 8 and finish between 10 and 11....The House of Blues is an American chain of live music concert halls and restaurants. It was founded by Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, and Dan Aykroyd, co-star of the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. A new band might only have 10 songs, while a band like U2 has dozens at least. I'd say if you have 3 or more albums, a 90-minute show should be the minimum. But I remember being disappointed the first time I saw Depeche Mode, as well as a NIN concert I saw, each of which were only 90 minutes. If you've got a 30-45 minute set then I'd say about 7-10 songs, depending on how long your songs are, and how much stage banter you do. If you arrange a gig, the venue or promoter should tell you how long your set will be, and if they don't, there's no harm in asking.",,3Z4GS9HPNWW7IUV99B57VLJ05MJ77Q,0.0

I ended missing 2 days of work due to not feeling up to interacting with people. I remember thinking what a waste of my vacation days since I could not even do anything fun with my time off. Even though he wasn't home with me during the days I missed, my significant other played a key role in me getting better. He came right home after work and did not go out with friends or run any errands. He must have sensed my surprise since I kept asking him why he was so attentive. I was not expecting a response from him, but was surprised when he responded. He admitted to me that he felt a need to be more attentive and decided it was best if he was home to take care of me. It was a nice surprise to hear and made me feel even more at ease knowing he was doing it because he wanted to and not because he felt forced. The best part of the whole thing is when he made me soup and dinner. It was nice being taken care of for once and not being depended on to do everything. I think he also understood it as well. He commented to me afterward how much work it is to take care of others and how time consuming it can be. If anything I think it made him appreciate me more and also appreciate how being in a relationship is a two way road. Though it would have been nicer being taken care of on a normal day without being sick, I will take what I can get. If being sick was the catalyst for things getting better between me and him, then I am ok with that.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI,0.0

A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.",,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G9K5MNA,0.0

I was involved in a freak car accident that happened after I had just dropped off my brother at the gym. I was driving straight and heading towards target. I had the light and was listening to my favorite music, I was so focused on what I was going to get at target that I guess I wasn't as aware of my surroundings. I was driving and crossing the intersection, as a car ran the red light from my left side and sent me into a spin. They made contact on the rear of my car, causing me to not know where I was heading and leaving me unable to control the car. I was lucky enough that the car tried to stop and swerved so much that I was hit with the side of the other car instead of the front of the other car. This was very striking as it was something that nobody expects, especially since I was just heading to the store. This left me in awe as my car came to a stop a little past the middle of the intersection. I was thankfully left unhurt and as soon as I was able to come to come to my senses I stepped out of my car. The other driver was also unhurt besides slight soreness and jitters. The driver made sure I was ok and called the cops to the scene, luckily there were witnesses at the scene to give a different perspective. I then called my spouses and parents to let them know what happened as I was the one who was running errands. The whole situation showed me that unexpected things could happen suddenly and change how you continue your day or change it overall. Luckily my car was not totaled and just needed some work on the rear side to assure that it was drive able. Overall, from this day I became very thankful for the things that I take for granted and make sure that I am always paying attention to my surroundings. I now am very cautious when driving and more so since I would not want to get into another accident.",,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG49ZMTK7,0.0

I had my coffee and made my breakfast.  I ate outside as it was sunny and cool at 7am and wanted to enjoy the view.  Everything was going perfect until the phone call.  I received a call from my boss asking if I had a few minutes to talk.  I said, ""of course"" thinking she might be asking me to work overtime one day next week, or possibly come in later that day.  That's when things went sour.  My boss advised me that he was not happy with the quality of my work.  He said that he is getting pressure from upper management and that he needed to put more pressure on his staff.  He said if I did not clean up my act that I would be out of a job within a couple weeks.  He was blunt and quick with the conversation and hung up before I could ask him any questions.  Just like that my perfect day took a turn for the worst.  I immediately starting thinking about my mounting bills and student loans.  I could feel my blood flowing through my arms and my chest.  I started to sweat as I thought about my rent, car loan, student loan, insurance cost and utility bills.  Before I even knew what was going on, I was slouched in my chair and having a panic attack.  I thought I was going to faint.  I was sweating and breathing heavily.  I ran to get a glass of water and was shaking and could barely drink it.  I called my mom to come over right away.  5 minutes felt like 5 hours as I thought about the mounting costs of going to the hospital.  The bills and cost of medication to help me through this time were going to pile up.

About a month ago, my family and friends threw me a birthday party to celebrate two very important milestones in my life. The first one, of course, was my 23rd birthday. The second was that I celebrated my first birthday as a man instead of a woman! Last year was the first time I told anyone that I was transgender. When I first told my family and a few close friends, I was really worried that they would reject me. It took a lot of soul searching to go through with it. But except for my oldest sister, my family has accepted me as an evolving man and supported me. I did lose a couple of friends who just couldn't accept me as a man, but I've made new friends in the transgender community who went though the same things (or worse) that I did. I started my hormone replacement therapy this past January and love the changes! My voice is deeper, I'm actually growing a beard (I get to shave my face every third day!) and I'm working out in the gym a couple of times a week to build my muscles.  What's really special to me is the new bond I have with my dad. I was more afraid of losing his love and acceptance than anything, but he took the news surprisingly well. We're forging a new relationship and finding that we have more in common with me as his son instead of his daughter. I love living life in a male body.

He bought all the supplies I would need to start the job, gave me money for gas, and even bought my meals for a few weeks. I had never done anything like this for him. It really shocked me how willing he was to help me, nobody had offered anything like this to me before. He really helped me out and allowed me to use the money I made on all the bills I had backed up.

He even went to bat for me with the boss when they tried to take advantage of me because I was the new worker. Even when I got injured on the job he made sure that they treated me right and that I got the treatment that I needed.

I'm actually still shocked as to how amazing the entire evening went. Me and my boyfriend went to this beautiful Mexican restaurant, I had cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans while he had  steak chimichangas. The dinner was amazing and I'm sure the waitress was really happy too for the big tip she got. For months we had waited for this night. Tonight was the night that one of our favorite artists would be in town and we had bought tickets a long time ago. The artist was Electric Light Orchestra, and now that we were done eating we were heading to see the show. Tonight would be the last night I would see my boyfriend for the entire summer so we wanted to make it special. Me and my boyfriend absolutely love live music, one of our favorite things to do is go to shows and I'm so glad we went to this one. We couldn't believe it, Electric Light Orchestra opened with most favorite song! We spent the entire night listening to good music and eating food. We were in love and nothing could change that not even a summer apart from each other.  We didn't worry about a single thing all night, just enjoying ourselves and each other's company.  I don't think this is a night i'll ever forget the rest of my life and it's already been four months since it happened. My boyfriend is going to be back soon since summer is almost over, I can't wait. I usually don't wait this long to write into my diary but it's taken me this long just to process how magical this night was.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFCI8UOO,0.0

She told me that my grandmother has not been feeling very well lately, and I should see her. It sounded like a good idea, and I changed my plan. Instead, I visited my grandmother in the hospital, and decided that I would stay there for a week. Doctors told me that due to her diabetes, she has been feeling very unwell. However, I thought it was because of loneliness, since she also used to live alone. She was very happy to see me, and even happier when she got to know that I am there to stay with her. I brought over some books, which I used to read it to her. She had been showing a tremendous positive progress since I had went to her. After a week, I had to go back to my home to meet my family. I felt really upset on leaving her alone like that. After some days, the doctors told that her health is declining again, and it would be very difficult for her to survive. The news was indeed very saddening, however I was thankful that I got to spend her last days together.",,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBS08LX,0.0

We walked down a dirt road in my neighborhood where I knew we would see many interesting things including an old cemetery at the end of the road. This cemetery was what I would call a ""farmer's cemetery"" as most of the people listed on the tombstones were related and multi-generational and it was built on some old farmland. My grandson and I read some of the tombstones and discussed some of the ages when people died and were buried there. We came across a tombstone of a boy who died at age 5, the same age as my grandson. My grandson had a difficult time understanding how someone his age could have died. He said he thought only old people, like me!, died. I explained there were lots of reasons why a young person could die, such as an accident, disease, illness, etc.  He seemed to be surprised but also enlightened to his mortality. I was surprised that he believed only old people could die. The only people he knows who have died were all elderly, so it makes sense. It was also surprising that he considers me old. That never came up before. I don't like to think of myself as old, but to a five year old, I guess I am. It made me think about my mortality too.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE7LUAX0,0.0

Although my older son was in school the past two years, part time and then a full day, I always had my youngest with me. I can't remember the last time I was consistently alone, well I can but it was about five years ago.  Their dad works full time and is almost never home, and never does anything related to school activities. The first day was crazy for me. I drove to my oldest son's school and got him settled with her and made sure he was comfortable and confident starting Kindergarten. I hightailed in out of there back to the car and got my youngest back in his seat and booked it to his school. Of course we live in a ridiculous town which hasn't done construction work all summer, yet they chose the first day of school to close down the roads surrounding two of our biggest schools. I was already rushing because my sons are supposed to be at their school 5 minutes apart and that's not even humanly possible, although I'll still always try. Finally got to my second son's school and got inside to find his teachers, get him all signed in and I just made it in time. I said goodbye and felt bad for all the parents whose kids were screaming, crying, hitting and straight losing their shit because they didn't want to leave their parents or go to school. My son just stood in line and walked out with his class and as he leaves he turns around and goes, you're going to come back right? What of course I'm going to come back I'll be here when the day ends to pick you up and then we'll go get your brother from his school and then get home. He walked out with his class and I left the building. All these other parents were crying and visibly upset about leaving their kids at school, I literally walked out the door, stood still for a moment and took a deep breath. I finally was alone, and it was going to happen again tomorrow, and the day after that, and the day after that. I felt guilty all the other moms were looking at me like I'm a lunatic because I'm relieved and not bawling my eyes out. But honestly to each their own, and if they had my kids instead of theirs I can tell you they'd be the one breathing a sigh of relief. For the first time in five years, I have time alone.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKJV9AH5,0.0

I decided to take a few weeks off from work and just reconnect with myself and nature. A friend had suggested I go to Alaska, it was far away and desolate, it sounded perfect. After much research I wound up agreeing to go dog mushing around the interior of Alaska with a native of the area. I was nervous for sure, but it sounded like the chance of a lifetime. I needed to break from reality badly. I had been working 7 days a week for months and felt like my brain was about to explode. After a few days of riding around the lonely outskirts of Alaska I really started to feel better. I stopped thinking about work. My mind totally cleared and for the first time in forever I really felt at peace. The scenery in Alaska is amazing. It is hard to explain. It is so plain and vacant, but is is beautiful. It looks untouched, like no one has been around to destroy it like the rest of the world. My favorite moment of the entire trip was when we took a short break to let the dogs rest. I was sitting in the snow and I looked over and saw 2 moose walking across the ice. I had never seen a moose up close, it was breathtaking.

I appreciate that a lot as a woman who is not knowledgeable about cars and who always is afraid that mechanics are going to take advantage of me. The only thing I don't like about this auto shop is their parking lot and location in general is very cramped. There is not a lot of space to pull out or move. So I go to pick my car up and as I'm trying to back out of the parking space I left it in, I hit the dumpster behind. Immediately my car starts making a horrible noise. I can't believe it...I got into an accident right after fixing my car, before I even leave the mechanic shop! I go back inside in tears and tell them what happened. Get this...they look at what happened and fixed it for me, for free! I was shocked and amazed at their kindness and generosity. I wanted to pay them back, but I had to borrow a small amount of money for it, so I went home and talked to my sister to ask her to borrow money. I went back the next day with cash for the mechanic who fixed it, because I hate to be a damsel in distress.

Four and a half long, hard years and I can finally call myself a college graduate. The ceremony was weird, it felt different. I was expecting it to be like high school graduation; some bittersweet emotions, lots of crying, long huge. This was different. It felt transnational, like I was waiting in line at the bank. I think that's because in high school there's more to look forward to. ""I'm going to move out of my parents' house, make new friends and party every day for 4 years."" College graduation you're jut staring into the abyss. ""I need to find a job and work 40 hours a week otherwise I'm going to starve to death."" The stakes are high. Despite the fears, my friends and I were ready to take the plunge. We had our goodbyes and heart to hearts last night at Dave's house so there were fewer emotions today. We all promised to keep in touch, and I know a few of us will. A few of us brought our parents back to the house we rent. Grilled burgers and pasta salad is a far cry from the parties we used to trow there. I got to see my parents interact with my friends parents; immediately bonding and becoming friends with people they barely know. It made me confident that when I move away from this little insulated bubble of college life and enter the real world I can make my own friends and forge my own path.",,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K9EI37Z,0.0

It was their 50th wedding anniversary. I haven't seen them for four years. It's been a very long time and I had missed them. We had a lot of catching up to do. So maybe the first few days there I didn't get much sleep. We had some of the best conversations parents could have with their children. I even had the chance to get a few pranks on them. During my time away I did a lot things like growing up and becoming I am today. I was really into making arts and crafts. So I made them a picture collage. It had pictures of my family when they were younger. I also framed it as a gift. After spending a bunch of time with them and having experienced things I haven't before it was time for the anniversary. The day of the anniversary we spent it together as a family and had a lovely time.,,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZCT8SVF,0.0

My favorite pet ever, Ashton, passed away from old age. Her vet said it was likely to happen this year but still I was not prepared mentally for this. She was the best possible cat ever, and everyone I know absolutely adored her. She would always rub up against other people's legs when the came to my house. And boy did she ever love her tuna! Despite owning more than 10 cats in my life, I have never seen another cat as social as Ash was. It's truly a huge loss for me and my family. My grand daughters especially loved playing with her when they came over to visit. Thankfully I will always have the images and videos of her running around and being hilarious, but it's not quite enough. I know some people have asked me if I will be getting another cat to keep me company, and I'm not sure. In some ways I cannot imagine having a cat who is better than Ash. Or maybe I just need some time to pass so I am not so emotional. It's been more than two months and I'm still struggling to hold back tears over it.

That stay at the hotel changed my life. I met my now girlfriend there and we spent the week together in California. We had such a wonderful at Coronado beach and San Diego. We went to the zoo, saw seals laying near the ocean, went bike riding along the beach and shared countless meals that week. I truly believe that I met my soulmate three months ago at that bar in the hotel. We shared our thoughts, memories, stories, struggles, hobbies, families, childhood stories and just about everything else. I don't think I stopped smiling since I met her. When she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, which required me to move across the country to California, I was hesitant at first but I couldn't say no. I knew that I would lose her if we tried to do a long distance relationship. She said she would support me while I find a job out in California and while that was nice, I was still very worried. What kind of person just quits their job and moves across the country? Well, I decided that since I am young to go for it. If the relationship did not work out, I always wanted to live in a warmer climate anyway. Lucky for me I ended finding a great job in my field right away and drove across the country to live with her. Our time together so far has been a dream. I look forward to every minute we spend together. Sometimes I wonder to myself what would have happened if I decided to not trust my gut.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EB6MYW2,0.0

She almost killed my husband and herself! My husband and I went over there for a quick dinner and to help her fix her plumbing issues. She wasn't paying attention and poured some sort of chemical down the toilet that reacted with the unclogger my husband had used. Immediately it caught fire and exploded a few seconds later. The seat of the toilet was completely shattered and went flying! If my husband and his mom were standing a little bit closer they could've been killed! I heard the explosion from the other room and came running. Thankfully my husband only had a slight cut on his back from the debris, while his mom was untouched. We all stood there in shock at how lucky we had been. Then we could only laugh at how ridiculous it was for her to pour chemicals down the same toilet we were supposedly working to fix. She always forgets stuff like this now that she's getting older, so it's scary to think about her doing this when we aren't there. Luckily my husband is a handyman and was able to rig a new toilet seat on, but not after some real trial and error.

I didn't see it coming.  I didn't imagine that it would happen so quickly.  One moment he was here, the next he was gone.  Seven months isn't very long, and my heart still feels broken into a million pieces.  People say that time will heal things, but at this point I don't know that I believe that saying.  Those million broken pieces of my heart seemed to have been scattered by some unknown wind and I have yet to find them.  I can only imagine what my mother must be feeling right now.  My father had suffered some strokes previous to this all deadly one.  But, he came through them before and was still his cheerful self.  However, the day this deadly stroke happened was awful. My mother was home with him and they were getting ready to go on vacation to Yellowstone.  My father was a nature enthusiast and loved getting away to places where he could be closer to nature.  He always told me that it made him feel at home and brought to his heart a peace like no other.  As they were packing for this trip, the deadliest of strokes slammed my father.  My mother noticed the symptoms of previous strokes, but this time they got worse.  She dialed 911 and the paramedics arrived.  They loaded him into the ambulance and rushed him away.  My mother was able to ride in the ambulance with him.  The paramedics worked furiously on him during that drive to the hospital, and then, silence.  He was gone.  The phone call came.  It was my mother.  Her voice was full of the deepest sorrow on earth as she told me that dad was gone.  My heart sunk, and broke, and tears flowed down my face like a never ending waterfall.",,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87K9OEMK,0.0

I was kind of anxious to see everyone again. It's been years for some fo them. Luckily everyone gets along. We all arrived at the venue which was a really nice local garden. It was really impressive even from the very start. I was really impressed how much work they out into it! It was a wonderful day and I was so happy that everyone seemed really relaxed. Everyone seemed to be in a great mood and very friendly. The more casual vibes made it a great and enjoyable celebration of their union.

Veronica and I had dated since high school. I thought she was the woman I was going to marry. 4 months ago, totally out of the blue, she broke up with me. I was devastated. We did everything together. Not only was she my girl friend, but she was my best friend. I thought we had the perfect relationship. We liked the same things, we had the same friends, we could even finish each others sentences. When she broke up with me, I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After the break up, I stayed in and didn't talk to anybody. I didn't want to go anywhere, or do anything. I fell in to a really deep depression. My mom finally convinced me to go see a therapist. Little did I know, that therapist would change my life. She made me realize how much I had to offer and that the break up was not because of me. I didn't see it at the time, but Veronica and I were just comfortable with one another, we were not soul mates. We had just been holding on to something because we were afraid to move on. I'm finished with my therapy and I feel better about myself than I have in a long time. As a matter of a fact, I'm going on a date next week and I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time. Several weeks after my therapy ended I realized that I could not get my therapist out of my mind. I called her up and asked her out and since I am no longer her patient, she said yes.

When the doctor saw that he couldn't move his foot, he sent us to the ER to have the foot looked at. Everyone at the ER was very nice. One of the nurses was actually the father of one of my son's friends. It was a small world! We did have to deal with the bad news that he needed to have surgery on his foot. He had smashed the top of his foot and a few of the bones was shattered. We had to explain to the nurses and doctors that the teacher told us that him and a few other boys were playing with desks and one fell on his foot. We got the surgery scheduled and our son was a trooper and didn't really seem phased by it. More than we can say about ourselves because we were scared out of our minds about this! This was our first experience with a surgery of any kind and to have it done on our son made it worse! I cried so much while he was getting his foot worked on!

I was unaware he was so keen to what is going on in my personal life. His father passed away about a year and a half ago and it has been really rough on me. I try to hide this from him but I guess he picked up on it. The poem he wrote seemed to be in the style of dr seuss. Part of my suspicion is confirmed by the fact that the picture on the front shows both of us in a tall striped hat. The poem read as this. ""Sometimes mom cries, and thats okay, because I love her on mothers day. Shes a good mom and makes me food, shes a girl but a real cool dude."" I was shocked to know that he sees me crying or is at at least aware of it. It made me re think how i show my emotions and my abilities as a mother. I want to show him i am strong but feel so weak. I very much wish he had a good male role model. My father passed away long ago, and my husbands family lives across the country. I need guidance but dont know where to look. I'm thankful for my son, and all he does to keep me going, but I worry I might not be doing enough.",,3R6BYFZZP8YEC2G6977HDC95415FXG,0.0

I went to her funeral and talked to old friends of ours. They started talking about how we all went for coffee and donuts before it became a huge fad with teens. After the funeral, I went to Dunkin Donuts and got a dozen donuts and a large coffee. I sat in the parking lot eating and crying. I wish I could say that that was the only time I did that. It wasn't. I did this every week for months. Sometimes, when I got really sad, I'd do it multiple times. In 3 months, I gained 25 pounds. I knew I had to get a hold of myself.

I was the only xray tech/ct tech working that shift and it was pretty slow.  Being 8 months pregnant with my first child, I got tired very easily. As I was sitting at my desk, nodding off from boredom, I felt my hospital pager buzz in my pocket.  I was instructed to call the emergency room where they informed me that we had a 'John Doe' coming in and  that they would be wheeling him directly to cat scan from the ambulance.  I ran - more like wobbled - to the cat scan room and prepared for the unidentified man to come in. My heart was beating a bit faster, was it from the run down here or the anticipation of the trauma? The EMS team arrived with the emergency room lead doctor following behind. On the count of three, we pulled Mr. John Doe over to the CT table and I could start my exam. Code stroke - a passerby found him unresponsive for who knows how long. I looked down to exam my patient and I'm sure at that moment my face went white.  My throat instantly felt like there was a ball in it and I wanted to freeze, hug him, and cry. This was life threatening and I needed to move on quickly. ""I know who your John Doe is"" I said to the emergency team. It was a friend of mine, a very close man that I looked up to throughout my life. He was a father of 3, he was an ""uncle al"" to my stepson, he was maple syrup enthusiast, a member of our church, he was a ball player on my husband's baseball team; He was not just a john doe, he was our Al. After 3 days of life-supporting machinery with weeping family members at his bedside, uncle Al passed away. Every morning during that 3 days towards the end of my shift, I would be required to take a bedside chest xray to track his progression. During that time I would reminisce on our memories together. We still don't have answers to why he had a heart attack in the first place. His heart malfunctioned, and then his organs followed behind and shut down as well. At only 46 years old it was a shock to us all. I like to think he had another, more important, place to be.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950T136BP,0.0

I was trying to complete a project at the office while everyone else was enjoying the Christmas party. Jan kept coming into my office to ask me to drink with her and to dance, it was obnoxious. She was obviously drunk,. I asked her several times to leave me alone and she would not stop touching me and harassing me. After an hour of the constant annoyance I snapped. I told her exactly what I thought of her and how terrible she was. Everyone just stood and watched. No one joined in or had my back. I was distraught. My supervisors watched me be harassed and did nothing. After my outburst I knew I was done at that company, so I quit. I just grabbed my things and walked out.

She had gone through 6 rounds of chemo, her hair had fallen out, she had grown to a third of the size of the plump woman I once knew. She was frail, almost ghostlike in her disposition. I was afraid, as all children are when things like these happen, that my mother would not be there within a year. Thankfully, that little voice inside of me was wrong. She made a full recovery, as of today there is no sign of the cancer that had gripped her; however, this has taught me a few things. I realized I need to understand she wont be around forever, and that it, the cancer, might come back one day. It's not a one and done deal, this is a killer. My mother is strong, though, I have full faith that she will live for another dozen years. She's strong, and she won't give up that easily! We went to the Bahamas to celebrate, the place where my father and her met, and we drank and talked about life and what we would do now that she can actually, well, do things! She was always tired before, but now she's active and ready to make up for the time she's lost. I really appreciate that shes alive, but I wish she'd be more careful.

She tried her best to last as long as she could. She beat the odds every time it felt like and at times I thought she was simply invincible. Only way mom was going was kicking and screaming.

I came out of the bathroom & he had it setting on the table with candles & holding the camera with the lights off singing happy birthday. Then he gifted me with a beautful sterling silver & yellow gold heart bracelet! I just wanted to share with you awesome ladies & I hope all the September babies have an amazing birthday!  The surprise was a custom Harley Davidson that I had designed, and he spent 2 years building for me. i was really awesome and great feelings. i was really happy.  Well my birthday isn't until next week but my husband usually surprises me early because I don't expect it...actually I am catching on lol. We went to the mall and had food court lunch. I was good, I ate at the cafe that has salads and such. I had one of his french fried with ketchup and I couldn't believe how intense the saltiness was. I haven't had a lot of salt in the past few weeks so it was intense salt taste. I wanted to give him something really special and personal for Christmas (I believe it was our second or third Christmas together). I reflected back on gifts that my loved ones had given me through the years and decided that my absolute favorite gift was the photo album of my life that my parents put together for me. Given that my husband's parents had died several years before we met, I thought it would be the perfect way for me to get to know him and a beautiful memento of his life that he would cherish forever. I spent hours after work secretly rifling through a box of photos I found, gathering the best shots of him, his family, his homes and his beloved dogs. I hoped he wouldn't see any part of my project before it was over since I wanted him to be totally surprised. I took pride and delight in my project. My heart overflowed with love and I could hardly wait for Christmas morning when he would open it and laugh, cry, and appreciate me all the more.",,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN90ZNYK,0.0

I kept telling them they were foolish and it would live forever. Sadly, though, about two months ago it finally happened. I was driving on the highway back home from work when I heard a bad clunking from the engine. After some recent repairs by my husband I knew it was probably a transmission failure.  Not good. I had to call my husband at work and he came to pick me up to take me home. But instead of going back to our house, he pulled into the Hyundai dealer! He had already arranged a test drive for a brand new Santa Fe, the car we had been talking about recently as wanting to own. After a great test drive and some consultation, my husband walked back into the dealership and handed the salesman his credit card. I was blown away!

Of all the rape stories happening in the news lately. The men at college seem so psychotic and aggressive. I will be so worried about her. I'm worried if something like that happens she will lie to me about it. I'm so concerned about her going away to college. She was staying with friends in California but still when she got back she still acts different... like something weird happened. But she's not willing to share it with me. I'm so concerned that she will grow up to be an evil woman because of some of her actions. Her visit to Cali really turned her into a bad girl. She seems so much different. I hope that at the end of college she can get a decent job because those student loans to burden onto a husband with his own job are too much for a man to handle. She will probably end up marrying a sugar daddy. A sugar daddy that she meets that will pay off her student loans. I can see it now. It's going to be so embarrassing.

She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate. It feels like I was just talking to her and planning our next get together. We'd planned to go to a concert with my brother and sister in July. I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February. She had been waiting to go that concert for years but hadn't been able to because our work schedules didn't line up. I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are. She'd been there for my wife and I through some hard times and was always willing to lend a hand to help us with the children. I can't believe that she's gone and I know that it's tougher on my wife. This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives. My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time. The funeral was difficult, but it was attended by so many people and my sister-in-law would've really been happy to know how many lives she touched when she was still here.

A mother and a business owner. I am so excited to help more businesses because the few that I have helped so far have actually grown thanks to my tracking of their money. They get more time at home with their families and can just focus on their business. This is such a passion for me.

My doctor initially told me it would be a good idea to help ease my symptoms, but I'm starting to really enjoy being out and about. About three months ago I was especially restless one morning and opted to take myself out for a day of fun. I hit the local mall and walked all through my favorite stores. I probably spent a full hour in Macy's alone. I bought a pair of new sandals and a really cute beach hat too, which are things that coincidentally help reinforce this new lifestyle I'm trying out. After shopping I stopped into a new restaurant that opened near the mall. It felt odd to eat by myself, but after a few minutes I really started to enjoy it. I almost felt like some important business person. My steak was perfectly cooked and I even had a margarita to drink. By this point I really started to feel my legs getting achy, and the 100 degree temperatures outside didn't exactly help things too much. Against my better judgement I ended up deciding to see a movie to cool down, but found myself frustrated when I realized the theater's air conditioning was turned off. Who turns off AC in 100 degree heat?!? I ended up finishing the movie, but my legs were not in great shape and I was feeling quite dehydrated. After sitting on a bench for a bit to gather my thoughts, I determined that I should not try to get home in this shape. Thankfully my good friend Judith answered her phone and was willing to come get me and take me home. I apologized to her for overextending myself on this day, but I think she understood how much I enjoyed my independence. Next time I might have to take it a little easier on these hot days!",,34J10VATJGKEDWHKO1IAM1Q4NR7QIK,0.0

That I went out with the kids to pick something at the supermarket. The kids was excited as they will be getting new toys. It took us two hours to get to the supermarket because of the traffic jam. Luckily for me and the kids we pick so many items in the supermarket. I had to even caution them on what to buy. After the kids are done with there shopping. We Both went together to pay our bills. As at these time I use three credit card of different banks. So I gave one of them to the cashier she later returned it, that it an insufficient balance. So in my mind if one is not going through the other should do. I gave her the second one also the same story not until I gave her the third one. And it turned out to be same story. I was so devastated I don't know what next to do or what action to take, I looked at the kids they were so happy with what they got. Now i began to think of returning those item we bought including the kids toys. Then the cashier turn back to me and helped me out as she paid for the grocery for me.

I have been reflecting a lot on the day he was born recently. As expected, my life has changed almost completely. It's all been for the better of course but it's made me think about things and look at them with new eyes. My priorities in life have changed and I have spent many nights thinking about my relationship with my own parents and family. I want to change so many things and be the best I can be for my son. My family ties haven't been strong since I became an adult and my son has made me realize it's time to change that because before I know it my parents will be gone and he will be a grown man with his own children. I want to be the kind of parent that instills family values. I want him to know and be close with his grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and all extended family. I want to be the kind of parent he comes home to see every thanksgiving and Christmas. I want him to know I tried and became the best person I could be all for him. I'm working on it and I won't stop! I'm enjoying every moment and trying to live in that moment. He's crawling and babbling and eating real food and I'm basking in it as long as possible as I know it won't last forever. We are going to see my parents next weekend and I can't wait to start this tradition of being together and having regular family get togethers.

He had a heart attack.  My story is going to be about him and the impact he had on my life.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and went to school there.  I moved to California, worked, and met my girlfriend at Stanford.  She had family in Georgia and we eventually moved out here to work and live close to them.  Her family is amazing!  Her father, Craig, has traveled the world as a missionary.  He did a few stints in Indonesia teaching poor people how to setup their village, collect clean water, and rear their children.  I loved this man from the moment I met him.  Selfless and very giving Craig would help everyone.  In fact, during my move to Georgia one of the tires on my car blew out.  I tried to put the spare on but the lug nuts were not coming off.  I was in the middle of nowhere, on the highway, with all of my worldly possessions, pets, and girl and completely stuck.  Well, Craig drove on out probably 150 miles or more, and helped us get going again.  That's the first time I met the man! After living in Georgia for awhile I soon learned that it was NOT anything like California.  Church is big around here.  BIG.  So I got involved with the Church, through Craig, and we started helping put roofs on the houses of widows.  Tough work for sure, but it was extremely rewarding.  I learned so much for the other men helping.  After Craig passed the entire community rallied together.  It was sad of course but amazing.  I am thankful I got to know such a great man and role model.",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHO8EDPD,0.0

The day was bright and sunny but felt chilly for summer. We went planning to see the animals, pick apples, ride the wagon. This year they added a big jump pad for the kids to play in! When we go there we played in the little wood houses they have first, then went to the yearly wagon ride! On the wagon ride the guide told us all about the farm and how much water it takes, how many apples they produce, and all sorts of information. After the wagon ride we were able to get lost in the corn maze, they added fun trivia to help point you in the right way this year. Then at the exit we were able to jump on the giant pumpkin pad. We of course gathered a bag of apple to bring home. The kids loved eating the fresh apples instead of bagging them. The little one was able to ride around on my solders while we walked around eating our apples. They also took away the pedal bike races and replaced it with a mine shaft play area where you could purchase bags of sand with gems. To finish up our day we looks at the animals, we saw little pigs, lamas, goats, and lots of other farm animals. We will probably be back again in the next couple weeks to go play for a while. I can not wait to go next year and see what else they add!",,3JBT3HLQF9OF8A5FOSR7MR3KF95PZA,0.0

I installed it and within an hour I had big red warning boxes popping up all over the screen saying my Windows 10 was compromised. There was a telephone number which I thought was microsoft so I called it. A guy with an Indian accent (naturally) answered and I told him my problem. Unfortunately, I could barely understand him so I asked to speak to an american-accented person. He hooked me up with another Indian person. By then, I was getting frustrated because I couldn't understand anybody but they seemed to understand what my problem was. So somebody else  came on online and gave me a quote for $225 to fix it and wanted my credit card number. At that point, I stopped and asked to make sure they were Microsoft but they never confirmed it in so many words (I thought about this afterwards). So I gave them my credit card number and they took over my computer and tried to fix the problem. The next day, I got the red error boxes again. I called them and wanted my money back and they said the charge was already gone through. I asked to speak to a manager, but nope, never got anybody else. I argued for a while with them and got nowhere. I hung up crying and called my bank and told them I was scammed. It took 2 days to get my money back from the bank. I can't believe this happened to me. I continually warn my friends about stuff like this. But now I know how scammers work. They scam you when you're vulnerable and have no other place to turn in the middle of your emotions! I swear, this will never happen to me again (I hope). I hope my bank is doing something about them - I got a letter afterwards explaining that it ""was"" a scamming company.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY74I44WI,0.0

We were walking around enjoying the sights and wandered into this kind of dive bar a little off the strip. It was a nice little place with some really friendly people. We were having some drinks and talking to another group there. They had some slot machines at the bar that you can play while drinking. I was playing casually, not paying all that much attention while talking to everyone. All of the sudden some bells and lights started going off. I didn't even know what was going on, but everyone was looking at me. I finally realized I had one the large jackpot. It was several thousand dollars! I was so happy about it that I bought everyone at the bar a round of drinks. It was a lot of fun after that. Everyone was coming up to me and hanging out and talking. We met people from all over that night, and it'll be something I'll always remember. To be honest though, I'm a little ashamed that this is the most memorable event in my life recently. The fact that it involved a lot of drinking and some gambling isn't something I'm that proud of.",,3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLFP2A8Y,0.0

I ran away from home and made my way to Port Authority in NY City never imagining that anyone could be bad in all my stupidity. A man there approached me and was being very friendly, so I thought. Being sixteen at the time I was pretty naieve. He asked me where I was going and I said to Florida, I had friends there. He offered me a ride from the train station to the airport. On the way he pulled into a back alley and started pawing at my chest and asked me to take off my clothes, I refused and fought back, he let up and then pulled out into an intersection. He ran the stop sign and another vehicle hit us. I was unconscious and the police came, THANK GOD for that accident. I woke up in the hospital with my parents by my side. The police said he was not taking me in any direction of an airport so I am sure he was taking me to become a prostitute or to kill me. I am so thankful to be alive, so ashamed still to this day of the horror I caused my parents, they are gone now but so wish I could tell them how sorry I am , it still eats me alive when I think of what I put them through.

Blissfully unaware, I enjoyed the prospect of having a new infant in the family to love and spoil as only a grandmother can. That happiness was short-lived, however, when CPS became involved in the baby's life because of events that had happened in her mother's history. I was shocked to find that she had things in her history that were so terrible that CPS felt the need to investigate and eventually remove the children from her care. This threw the family into chaos. Three months ago, things really changed. My son had to move in with my husband and I. My infant granddaughter also moved in. Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own. I love her dearly and want nothing but the best for her, but it is hard. This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions. Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?  I want to believe people can change, and I want to believe that someday my son and his family can care for her needs, but I am unsure. This has been one of the hardest times in my life. Although it has been so difficult, my sole focus is on this beautiful child and making sure she has the love, care, and attention that all innocent children deserve.",,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFGUB82XI,0.0

I got excited because that meant there might be decent fishing. We finish our hike (looping back to this bridge again) by mid afternoon. I get my stuff out and rigged up and start tossing bugs. Every offering, this fish beneath the bridge would short strike but never take. I switched to an ant and had my son grab it and let go. I figured it was time to let him cool down because I thought I could catch him on that pattern, but he had seen it too much to take it at that point. I went downstream, fishing the seams and holes I could find. As I walked downstream surrounded by these sequoias 40 feet around, I came to this pool at the end of a run. It looked fishy. You know what feeling when you're fishing new water but you get to a spot and laugh to yourself that if there's no fish in there you might as well pack it up now? It was that king of spot. I toss out my ant pattern from before, right at the bottom of the run before it opens up into a slow slow drift over a hole that was at least three times deeper than any hole I had seen up to that point. I look down to manage my line and prepare for a couple of mends to get that fly to drift perfectly through that hole. When I looked up I saw the silhouette of what would be considered Jaws in this tiny stream. He was nearly at my fly and then he pounded that thing. Not some measly sip. This big boy knew how to eat. I got a great hookset and it was game on. Within the first ten seconds this fish had launched itself two full body-lengths out of the water three times. It was an absolute rocket. It had all the room in the world to swim down because the pool was so deep, and then launch itself straight out of the water like it was straight out of Cape Canaveral.

I've always been so far removed from those things that I didn't even feel as if they existed. It was around 6:00 AM and I was headed to my jiu jitsu class. I was in an Uber going around a small lagoon. I take this route every day, and this area is a rather affluent area that's considered safe. It was quite cold in the morning, and it showed. Generally speaking, people like to exercise around the lagoon. There wasn't a soul there. A man in his 30's was sitting in his car. Then I noticed that his hands were above his head, and there were two men on motorcycles next to him. It was as if he just completely freaked out, because there was a motorcycle on each side of him. He came to a full stop on the middle of the road, and my uber slammed into the back of him. I luckily came out mostly unscathed, I only sprained my wrist. He ended up having  a concussion.

My husband, younger son, and I all made the trip to get him moved into his dorm. It was a very emotional experience for all of us.  As we first drove onto his campus, his new home for the next 4 years, I felt very reflective. I thought about how quickly his childhood had gone. I thought about all of the hopes I had for him to have a happy experience. I also thought about my fears and concerns, and the fact that he was not going to be as protected by us anymore. I started to get teary-eyed, but then as we pulled up to the dorm, I was struck by the warmth and enthusiasm of the upperclassmen who were there to welcome the new freshmen. The next few hours were a blur of activity, as we got him settled into his dorm, met his roommate, and walked around campus a bit. Finally it was time to leave. The moment to say goodbye was very emotional for me. My husband got teary-eyed as well. But what really surprised us all was the reaction of our youngest son. He had been acting very aloof the whole day, as if he was indifferent. When the moment to say goodbye was actually upon us, he sobbed. His emotional reaction took us all off guard, and then we all had to struggle to keep our emotions in check.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLKSHM83,0.0

He had been to his primary and the ER at least 4 times just to be told “we can’t find anything wrong with you.” He was suffering for weeks - his resting heart rate was around 115 BPM, he was swollen, he was coughing, he was fatigued, he couldn’t sleep, and he just kept getting worse. He’s a self-employed contractor and couldn’t work because he could barely walk to his mailbox without getting winded. FINALLY this past Friday he went to the ER again (a different one this time) and started to get answers. Initially they thought his doctor was mismanaging his diabetes, seeing as she changed his insulin 2 months ago and they detected a slight heart attack that everyone previously missed. He was admitted to the cardiac unit at Sarasota Memorial and since that time they have found a blood clot on his heart and they’ve diagnosed him with congestive heart failure. With him being uninsured and self-employed, this has been a huge financial burden for him. He has had to miss a lot of work and he’s not even sure he can continue his business now due to its strenuous nature. My father was discharged a couple of days ago but it will be a huge change for our family going forward. He is unable to work and will have a whole slew of appointments for the next 3 months. He has a life vest that he has to wear and is currently on blood thinners. If his heart doesn't get stronger in the next 3 months he will have to get a pacemaker. Financially this will be rough on our entire family because he will be unable to work. I am going to try and pick up additional shifts at work so that I can help him with money. We are praying that his heart will get stronger so that he can find some sort of work.",,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCNFH32R,0.0

I had a tree that was dying and in danger of falling in my front yard.  I have been told sometimes these dying trees are referred to as 'widow-makers' because they have been known to fall over on a whim and cause fatal accidents.  After learning that, I decided the safest thing to do would be to chop it down preemptively.  I used a chainsaw and this was my first time using this tool as well as my first time cutting down a tree.  Well, I learned my lesson because the tree fell down in the wrong direction and almost killed me anyways.  The one thing I was trying to prevent in the first place.  This came as a total shock because I did not even consider this being a possibility to watch out for.  I should have watched a youtube instructional video first!  As usual, I thought I could handle anything and did not need to research such a ""simple task"" before hand.  I was wrong. I always expected my life to flash before my eyes in an event like this.

I kept doing that until the ambulance arrived and took her outside and loaded her.  They spend 15 minutes trying to bring her back before leaving for the hospital. I followed the ambulance to the hospital calling my wife and telling her to go home to her mother in laws and stay there as I thought correctly that no good news were coming.  Just a few days before my aunt had celebrated her 90th birthday.  My mother who is turning 81 this November and their sole remaining cousin who had turned 100 a few weeks prior both attended.  It was beautiful to see all three of the oldest members of the family together, not knowing it would be the last for one of them. When I arrived at the hospital I walked to the ER and waited for news.  Eventually the Dr in attendance called for family members.  Me and her caretaker walked in to the room where my Aunts body was covered in a white sheet.  The Dr explained that she may have choked but according to her caretaker she collapsed while sitting at the kitchen table, we think massive heart attack.  What really stayed in my mind was the Drs words regarding the medications that were administered to her ""it was like we were using water. no response.""I stayed there with her body for 3 hours until my cousin who lives 120 miles away arrived.",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZST0JY8P,0.0

I woke up one morning and everything seemed normal, but it wasn't! The night before one of my eyes had been red but it didn't hurt. I took my contacts out of my eyes and decided to sleep without them that night. Everything was fine with my eye in the morning so I put the contacts back in. My eye was no longer red. I went about my morning as I usually do when all the sudden I saw red gushing down before my eye. Right in front of me, like someone had put a red lava lamp in front of me, I saw what looked like blood, but it wasn't there when I waved my hand in front of my eye. I thought there was something in my hair but there was nothing. I realized there was something going on with my eye. It was freaking me out because not only had nothing like that ever happened to me before I also had never heard of anything like that happening to anyone else! I drove myself to the eye doctor unbelievably with my eye like that. The eye doctor sent me to a retina specialist. What happened 3 days later was that I had to get eye surgery because I had a hemorraged blood vessel in my eye. I remembered about 3 nights before that I had accidentally hit myself in the eye with my hand. It hurt for awhile but then I had forgotten all about it. After the surgery I still saw little blood vessel floaters for a couple of weeks but am happy to say my eye got back to normal. That was a really scary situation and I do not ever want to go through that again!",,3EFE17QCRDRQUHLDANPUHP4QFXDHS7,0.0

I'm 24 now, and as I grew up, my family usually went on some type of trip each year, whether a smaller one for the weekend or a week-long vacation. This one was different though, both because it was my first vacation since moving out on my own as an adult, and because it's the first one I've gone on since my parents divorced. I grew up with my Stepdad, I don't remember a time before he was my acting father, and so it was just very strange to be going on a vacation without him. My brother didn't go either, so it was just a bit of a shock overall, I suppose. Everything was so different and I didn't expect to be so emotional, but I couldn't stop myself from thinking about how everything just felt wrong, lonely almost. From the activities we now couldn't afford to do on just my mom's salary (she wouldn't let me help pay), to how I just didn't have my brother to sit and talk to once the parents went to bed. He's close to my age, and we always used to have sort of a mini-vacation of our own on these trips, bonding in a way we never did at home. My mom, sister and I had a good time, maybe even a more relaxing one without the boys complaining, but I couldn't keep my mind off of how it just seems lately like my family fell apart. I know my parents never wanted that, but it's been a rough couple of years. I barely speak to my dad now, and sometimes it's just a painful reminder that I guess he never really was technically my dad. I spent a lot of time laying on the beach cabana, letting the sun warm my face while I just took it all in. I feel different since coming back, like maybe I developed a new understanding for things, maybe got a bit of peace about the situation. But I can't help but feel sad when I think about how my little sister is growing up in essentially a different family than me; she won't remember much of us all being together and happy. She'll have memories of going  back and forth to mom's house and dad's, and I hope she just finds stability in that somehow the way I'm struggling to find it in this situation, even as an adult.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9ASH5GFO,0.0

We had grown up together, going to grade school and later middle school and high school.  While we ended up living in different states after college, I thought I knew him very well.  He didn't come across as the type to go to one of those rallies or one who would support their ideology.  His social media didn't even provide any clues as to this.  I found out because another friend hit me up about some weird pictures on John's Facebook profile.  It turns out, he had created a setting to hide this from most of his friends and family.  He was only posted that stuff to his new 'friends'.  His old friends and family received a 'sanitized' version of his life.  This version was free from the hateful rhetoric on his unfiltered page.  He was obviously conflicted about it, or he would not have been filtering it from others.  I confronted John about it, as we had always been accepting of others and tolerant towards all but the intolerant.  On the phone call, he got really quiet for a second.  Then said that he was actually glad this came out and that he had long felt I was a 'naive libtard' and that I needed to wise up.  I was crushed that a friend had been lured down what I feel is a dark path of xenophobia and hatred.  I had no idea.  It pains me, but he has since cut off contact.  As a result of this, I have made a point to keep in closer contact with distant friends and to always let them know that I am there for them if they need to talk with someone.  Hopefully this will help to keep others from sliding down that path.",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9A0QX3AX,0.0

The thoughts go out in my mind every time I think about it. Every few minutes this hurts even more. I really can't stop thinking about it and I use God to get away from it. For that hour or more in church, I am me again and don't think of anything else besides my love of God at the time and that is all. I hope one day I will have the power to stand up to my step father in prison and say I forgive him. I want it to happen but I know I need time. Time is of the essence because as he rots in there, I am free. He took my freedom from me for a bit but slowly i am getting it back. It is hard for me to get in relationships with everyone because of the emotional frustrations I am caused. Mr Smalling is the light in my life to help fight through the pain. He is a person I trust and can go to whenever I can. I really think about the good times when talking with him and how patient the man is. I will be healed one day but for now I fight the fight.

In the last month, I had been trying to exercise more. Originally I had to go really early, but as the heat of the summer died down, I was going out later in the day. I had worked out several different walking paths that would give me different distances. I was trying to walk at least two miles a day, but wanted it to be closer to three. I made myself get up, despite being tired. I walked out from my house and started the initial circuit. I was tempted to cut it short and walk a shorter path. But I decided to make at least the middle distance. I played music with an energetic beat on my phone and put on headphones. The music helped me pick up the pace. I was thinking about things I had to do during the day, and trying to psych myself up to do them. Then while I was approaching the corner furthest from my home three dogs ran up to me. They were barking wildly and jumping at me. It was clearly pack attack behavior. They were small to mid-sized, but my heart was racing and I was really getting scared. I kept trying to back up and they kept following. I was wearing shorts and was afraid they would bite me. I did not have anything to defend myself with. I took a swing at them and kept yelling. Eventually, they took off. I walked back and one of the neighbors was watching. She said the dogs had been causing problem the last few days. I decided to give up on the walk and went home. I was really stressed and t took a while to calm down.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYDZKYLB,0.0

While I was there, I wanted to go for a hike and found a trail in Lamar Valley so I decided I would take some time to go. The trail was so nice and peaceful, but as the sun started to set, I started hearing some heavy footsteps nearby. I stopped in my tracks as I didn't know if it was another person or an animal. In that moment, I really wished that I brought someone with me. I was getting really nervous and scared of what I would see. I was completely surprised when I saw that a BEAR had walked close to the trail. I tried to stay calm as I tried to think back to what I knew about bears. I stayed quiet so I didn't bring the attention to me. I slowly walked away while trying to stay light on my feet. My heart was pounding the entire time. The bear kept moving further along the trail so I went back towards the entrance so I could get back to safety. Luckily, I was able to get far enough from the bear that I could walk normally the rest of the way. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. I am so thankful that I got out of that situation unharmed. Hopefully I don't ever come into a situation like this again!",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RZ5L9PG,0.0

The others he is able to see and play with at recess. I know he wouldn't be able to see his old friends had I decided to initiate the transfer. I'm glad I didn't go through with that.

There was many emergency trucks and even some clowns and horses too. The parade was actually long for a small town. We thought about going to the fair grounds to watch the fireworks, but it was late and we were tired. We came home and the girls played some games on the switch.

I spent so much time without her and suffering and I am so grateful she took me back and accepted me. She didn’t have to forgive me for all the mistakes I have made but she did and it proves that we were meant to be together. Since I wrote this 3 months agO we have moved in together and started working on marriage and a baby. We get along so great now and now that the slate is wiped clean I can focus on being the man that she needs and wants. I’m t was a hard road getting her back but with time and love this can only get better. I unfortunately cheated on her a few months back and she found out about it and left me. I felt very sorry about what I did and I was amazed she still loved me after all these months. I often think back to that event and realize how stupid I was and that I should had given my girlfriend the respect she deserved and never cheated on her. I am a little bit older now and a lot more wiser and I’m just still in awe that she could forgive me like this and that makes me feel so honored that I have her in my life. The truth is I don’t know where I would be without her and I owe her so much. I often think about buying a home with her and starting a little family and I know deep down inside of my self that is what I want and I wouldn’t be happier with anyone else besides her. I would give my life to make her happy and I must learn to control my urges better and not sacrifice my happy life for a few minutes of sexual gratification. I want to be the better man that she needs and wants and I want to make myself a better man so I can properly grow and give my all to my family. I am excited to start this new chapter in my life and excited for the challenge of being a fAther and a good husband to my future wife.,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK6ZSY1L,,0.0

I really, really hated it there. Every day was torture, and I was miserable. I had a 45-minute commute each way, and I had to work at a backwards Protestant college, which had me hiding beliefs if not telling outright lies to survive. I somewhat hid that I was Catholic, and I hid that I am liberal on a lot of economic issues. I had to not confront racism and bigotry. Students wrote papers about how Frederick Douglas was an agitator, and the LGBTQ+ community was vilified. I couldn't risk losing that job and not feed my family. I put all my energy in getting another job, and it was a struggle to care about something again. I did get out and started to be me the moment I got the offer. Now I am making a lot more money and have a better future. I cut my gas costs to a third of what it was. I have more than an extra hour now that my commute is shorter. I can even go home for lunch.

Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall.  He is incredibly smart and gives all tasks his all.  He is super friendly, and kind of Ferdinand in that he doesn't like using his size to hurt others.  He also is home schooled, because as a parent, I am worried about bullying and the other social factors that cause students to become sidetracked from their studies and lead to emotional problems.  In any event, when Sam began playing football, he began with a group of kids that already had been playing together for years and also went to school together and lived in the same neighborhood.  He had made some friends, but this core group of kids was hard to crack - especially since Sam had no previous football experience AND the coaches were all father's of this golden crew. Sam was having an especially tough practice, and was confused about the instruction of a particular play - and finally angry because on day 7 Sam didn't know what in the heck a touch back, left tackle was or the different rules that apply to offense and defense yet.  The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear.  He was crying and so upset when all of those kids laughed and picked on him all practice.  I briefly spoke to the coach who did NOTHING but say it was FOOTBALL and to toughen up.  I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay.  He seemed a little off that day, but worked hard and had all the plays figured out as he had studied up the night before.  When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk.  After taking a couple of hits, Nate, the snot nosed coach's son, started hollering at Sam to do his job.  Sam called a time out and very loudly said, ""I tell you what, Nate.  I'll make you a deal - you stop talking smack about me and treating me like dirt, and I will do my job.  Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?  Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?  So what do you think?  Are you ready to be nice, or do I need to keep leaving a hole?""  The whole field was silent - and the kid was so red.  His mother gasped.  I was SO SO proud, of Sam - and then someone started clapping, and then everyone joined in.  He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!",3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,,0.0

The first few hours were not to bad they were a little loud, almost like having children in the backseat. Then a couple more hours in to the trip their true colors started to show. They started to argue almost every second, which made the trip pretty miserable. They are also huge chain smokers so the ten hour trip gained a few hours due to the frequent stops and long stops for them to smoke their cigarettes. At every stop it would take them about thirty minutes to do their business. In the car it would just be moments of silence followed by yelling followed by making out. It was one of the most uncomfortable trips ever. At the wedding they got into more fights which only made the trip back home even worse. There was more fighting more yelling and due to their stress over arguing we needed to make more stops so that they could smoke even more. It was so uncomfortable, I could not even look to the back of the car because I did not want to see them either arguing with each other or making out. By the end of it I wanted to jump out of the car. Who knew that people in their twenty's could still act like teenagers.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,,0.0

They have a worker in. Waste of working capacity and forces; refusing to have a pleasant pastime. the severity of labor, and other unpleasant feelings that accompany him. The capitalist’s main negative emotions are due to the fact that he should not most of the profit (income), and invest in production with a risk for yourself. The demand for final products is determined by such factors of production – rent, salary, profit. But the prices of these factors themselves determine consumer demand, because they form the income of the population. Marshall was the one who tried to solve this problem. He looked at her with the other side. Rent, salary, profit is really income of different groups of the population. But this is also a component of the cost of production. It turns out that the costs still, albeit indirectly, but affect the demand. But at the same time they directly affect the market supply. This is obvious, because the higher the costs, the less volume of production, which the capitalist is ready to produce at the same price. And for a definite threshold of the sum of costs, production ceases altogether. Can say that if costs affect both demand and supply, they are at the heart of the pricing. Thus, the utility and costs are two blades of scissors. Utility (need) forms demand, costs form a proposal. Each consumer himself determines his demand curve for each type of product. Her the value depends: on the budget of the consumer and the need for this product. As to each volume of the goods the certain price which suits the average consumer, the so-called demand price, then we can say that the same quantity of goods must meet a certain price that suits producer, that is, the price of the offer. However, in the second case, it is logical to say, that the relationship between the volume and the price of the offer is direct. The intersection point of the two curves will represent the situation when the most ideal price, or close to the ideal, according to which all subjects of economic relations are ready to interact. This is the point of market equilibrium, which is a determining factor in the study of market conditions. With such a mutual arrangement of the demand and supply curves shows readiness of consumers to purchase this product or service, and the producer is ready to give to the market. Speaking about the fact that the equilibrium between supply and demand is achieved only in one",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3Q6D2,,0.0

I was elated from our trip to Down Stream, and wanted to visit another casino sometime soon. I actually did not gamble very much on the trip, instead I stayed in our hotel room, and watched TV with my dad. We were watching Ellen DeGeneres TV show I believe it was called Game of Games. As the night wore on my dad, and I wanted to see how my mom was doing, so we took the elevator to the main lobby of the casino to look for my mom. We spotted her playing a Money Bags machine close to the lobby. My dad bought me a Red Bull and encouraged me to at least put a 20 in a machine. I agreed, and as I was drinking a Red Bull decided to play a slot that had Buffalo in the name. I turned my 20 dollars into 50, I was very content with quitting there, and just watching my parents play slot machines. After playing the slots we were hungry, and took advantage of a buffet at the casino. I love to eat at buffet's because of the selection and this buffet was really good. I had some Chinese food orange chicken, pepperoni pizza, and even had some fried chicken.  Completely satisfied all of us returned to our room to watch the local news channels. I don't know why but I enjoy watching local news when I am out of town, and like to compare their local news to our News on 6 in Tulsa. The weatherman forecast ed more rain for the area. The next morning I awoke and made myself a free cup of coffee, and decided to skip breakfast.  On our way home we stopped at McD's and had a Big Mac with a chocolate shake. We had a fantastic vacation, and it is something all of us want to do again sometime soon.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTPOXUI0,,0.0

It finally so happened that schedules aligned and we were able to meet up.  I was a little nervous at first.  I wasn't worried that she wouldn't approve or anything, but it's always a little bit of an unsure situation introducing people you're dating to old friends. We met at the restaurant, a local burger joint/bar.  The three of us had a great time! Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully.  Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house.  Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog.  My boyfriend made fast friends, and it was really sweet seeing him interact with her dog.  Overall, we had a wonderful time, and I'm sure that my significant other made a good lasting impression on a very important friend of mine.",36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD11KEB6,,0.0

We were going to need someone to take a chance on us and look past our credit worthiness. We looked at many houses, but people were not getting back to us most likely because of our credit.

In retrospect, that was one of my favorite parts of the trip. We stopped at resturants that we thought looked good. We just observed the landscape and went with no serious schedule. It felt good to not have to worry about work and just enjoy the weather and the views. Everything was interesting to see. We took a lot of pictures and we have them playing in a digital album in our dining room. It is fun seeing all the food that we ate and things that we saw.

I lived in the USA, and she lived in the Philippines. We made plans to meet up together and to start a life together. When the time was right, and I had lots of cash saved up and a passive flow of income, it was time to go there to the Philippines and meet for the first time. I was so excited. She seemed so excited also. She made plans for us to meet at the airport when I got off the plane. We were going to go out to eat with her family, and I was going to drop her off at her home, and go find a hotel to stay at for a couple nights. We were going to go find an apartment together the next week after spending more time together in person. We knew each other very well, or so I thought. We had been together for almost 5 years, talked everyday on skype and messenger. She kept track of my flight as I was flying, and we talked when I was able to. When I finally landed in the Philippines, got my luggage, got through customs, and immigration, I didn't see anyone. I looked and looked, and didn't see her. Her messages stopped, I tried to call her and she didn't answer for a long while. When she finally did answer, she told me she was sorry she could not come to the airport, and to just go find a hotel and we would meet up the next day. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and found a hotel. The next day, she called me and told me we could not meet up that day. She never gave me an answer as to why. Her friend, her cousin, and brother called me to break the bad news to me that she had a new boyfriend, and was pregnant. That's why she didn't want to meet. I ask her if it was true. She said it was, and was upset at them for telling me.",36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J707KY7,,0.0

My parents live with us in the basement and they went to visit my sister in another state.  We decided while they were gone we were going to do a whole bunch of fun things we would normally not be able to do while they were here and we had to take care of them.  On this day we bought ice cream, chips and made cookies.  We made a list of all the 80's and 90's movies that we wanted to see.  We made a ""bed"" on the living room floor and got all of our junk food out.  We watch video's and ate junk food all day long.  We would go from one movie to another and only stop if we needed the bathroom or more junk food.  After part of the day was over we changed TV's and moved to a real bed as even with all the pillows and blankets we were starting to feel the floor digging in.  My son was so excited about this day.  Some of the movies he loved and some he was not that impressed with.  My husband was really relaxed and happy.  It was a day of no one having to say no or argue with our pre-teen that he would not be allowed to do something.  We would love to do this day again.

It was significant to me not only because it was on our three year anniversary but also because I love him and had been wondering if he ever even wanted to get married since he always complained about marriage as an institution in the past. The most memorable moment for me was the long hike we took. My fiance proposed to me early on in the new year (2019) but it was the first warm week of winter. It felt like the sky opened and the sun came out just for us. We were even surrounded by swans!! It couldn't have been more perfect. I remember how joyous and refreshing our long hike felt. I was so shocked that he actually got down on his knee in the mud (because the sun had just melted the snow so the ground was muddy and gross still!) and ruined his jeans to propose. He's a bit obsessive compulsive about messiness and it always annoyed me. This gesture felt extra special and showed that he was making an effort to overcome his obsession with cleanliness. Since then, we have continued to grow as a couple. We have not started planning our wedding yet. We do have a date set though. We want to get married on the first Saturday in June of 2021. I hope we are able to prepare in time!",3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYP075HT,,0.0

In my mind I had built a bubble of invincibility around those I loved. ""It can happen to others, but will never happen to MY family"", I had foolishly told myself.  I wish we had talked more, listened to him talking more, and valued more of  the time we had together. Time has passed, but I still feel the pain of my father's death just a vividly as when it happened. I thought that the passing of time would lessen the pain, but it is still as sharp, if less frequent. I remember the times and memories we shared. During the time we spent, it was just enjoying each other's company. I never realized that I was making memories. There are so many things that were memorable about my father. When we were misbehaving as children, instead of other punishments, he would have us build on my mother's brick flowerbed walls. We would mix the mortar, lay the brick, set and clean. The permanence of the walls was a metaphor for the character we built, I came to realize later. I walked past a flower garden recently and was suddenly reminded of all the time we had worked on the flowerbeds. I had not thought about them for many years, but suddenly remembered them in detail. I felt his presence, the impact he had on me. I never would have thought the unorthodox discipline I had would have lasted for so long.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRZYE8DO,,0.0

She received a call that he had been found in his cell unconscious. She traveled over there and he never really did regain full faculties. The state released him to her and she had him transported over here to our state so she could take care of him. He lasted around 6 months before his body systems failed him. We buried him in the local cemetery. It was a very sad occassion to have to bury such a young man under such horrible circumstances. We have concated an attorney in the state of Florida. He is looking it finding any video or eye witness to what could have happened. The guards nor the prison are forthright at all. I know she needs these questions answered. When you lose one of 2 children in such a manner you need answers. I have my doubts though that she will find answers. She still does not know exactly what happened in that jail cell and probably never will.

At this time, I was beginning my second year of medical school and trying to figure out how to attend school in one state and be there for my mother while she was sick at home in another state. I spent the entire 3 month summer break back home, sitting in the ICU with her all day while she fought for her health and we hoped for her to get better. When the school year started, I flew home and planned to go to school during the week and fly home to be there for my mom on the weekends. After the first week of school, I was called to return home immediately because of a short prognosis for my mom. I flew home immediately and was there for her for every second of the last 3 days she had on this earth. This was a terribly difficult time for me and my family, with my mom passing away so young and so suddenly. We have been working hard to get back on our feet. I ended up taking a leave of absence from medical school and I'll be returning to school next fall. Since my Mom's passing, there have been two other deaths in the family. One of the funerals is actually tomorrow. I just feel like this is a really difficult time in my life and I'm still trying to figure out how to use this experience for good. I have been struggling with some depression for the first time in my life and also lack of motivation. But on some days, I also feel totally happy.

I find myself spending more money then accumulating it. In order to get help with my rent by HRA, I had to got to this place called America Works, It's suppose to help you or equip you with the skills to get  a job, and to recognize the areas you need a little push in. I was lucky enough to be able to absorb some of the information, revamp my resume, and hope I find a great company to work for. So since the incident of me leaving the job. I have been reflecting on how I can improve myself. I have been listening to people who have conquered the things I am trying to get through. I have learned that I need to leave toxic people alone. People that don't have my best interest at heart. I also learned maybe it's time for me to go back to school. Come Monday, I am looking at a free training course to become a Medical Assistant. Wish me luck!",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFR8PDDOT,,0.0

I had never done that so I was a little worried about busting into another meeting but I trusted what my boss told me. As I rounded the corner to the conference room - I could hear voices but I didn't think anything of it. I went into the room and everyone shouted ""Surprise!"" I was so shocked! They had organized the whole thing. The main organizer was a co-worker who had just started working there! They had presents for me and a donut shaped cake. Everyone sang Happy Birthday to me. It was really awesome and touching. I couldn't believe that they put so much effort into organizing such a nice gesture for me. They gave me some donut socks and a pair of donut covered pj pants that I love. They really know me and what I like! I think everyone enjoyed just getting a break and not having to work.

This occurred on December 15th 2018, and although occurred during the month of December, it turned out to be a very nice day. The day actually had me starting out alone since my wife to be spent the night at her parents house for an early day of getting prepared. I feel like the day flew by and before I knew it, it was over. The morning hours saw me and my groomsmen preparing for the big day and also had pictures being taken on both sides while preparing. The limo arrived to pick us up in the AM hours and then it was off for pre wedding pictures at a local park, where I would see my wife to be for the first time. Once we had all the photos we requested, it was off to church for the ceremony and services. Even this part of the day seemed to fly by. I would have never guessed that this day would move this quick since it was such a lead up to it. Once more photos were taken at the church and with extended family, it was off to our reception at a local country club. Everything was decorated perfectly and it was a nice winter/Christmas theme. After more pictures with the wedding party at this venue, the night was set to begin with introductions and the rest of the festivities. Cake cutting, dancing, and dinners rounded out the night for everyone that attended. This part of the night seemed to go even quicker than the rest of day. What a 5 hour event, seemed to be over in the blink of an eye. Everyone that we spoke to said how wonderful it was and how memorable it would be. I think it went off without a hitch and ended up being a big success.",3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RM04VH26,,0.0

There were 12 of us who traveled together. The cruise was for my in-laws 55th anniversary, so they took the whole family. The trip started with a flight to Barcelona, Spain. We spent the night there before boarding the ship. The cruise lasted for one week and included stops in Spain, France, and Italy. We went on excursions almost every day. The weather was very hot, as there was a heat wave in Europe. The buses we took for excursions had very little air conditioning, making the trips miserably hot. In general, we had fun, however the days were very long and tiring. The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip. We had many food allergies in the group, and they did not do a good job accommodating. I've been on other cruises where they over accommodated for allergies, but this ship did not meet those expectations. All-in-all, I'm happy I had this experience and I saw a lot of places I would want to visit again.

To be a working member of society instead of feeling sorry for myself with my disabilities. Even if my disabilities become too much of a problem at least I could be proud of finishing college. Finishing college has always been a dream of mine. Even finishing the first semester would have been enough for me a long time ago. However,  after getting high grades the first semester I knew for sure I could pursue this dream entirely. I had understanding professors. Which helped a lot. The subjects weren't too hard.

I first met GW when I went to work for my uncle at his business after I graduated from college. GW was my uncle's neighbor and he worked part time there. GW didn't talk a lot but he had a wicked sense of humor. He and his wife, AW, raised 4 kids together in the same house for 50 years. I didn't get to see GW often after I got a new job and moved but I heard for AW that GW wasn't feeling so well since last year. He was in and out of hospital a lot of the time. Then in March I got a call from AW that GW was in the hospital again and would like to see me and my uncle. I got the feeling that this might be the last time we will speak to each other again. This might be the goodbye the we all dreaded. On a beautiful Saturday I drove my uncle and my aunt to visit GW at the hospital. On the way there we bought him some flowers for the room. When we got there I could hardly recognize GW. He looked so thin and frail and his cheeks sunk in quite a bit. I felt so sad that some tears actually came out. GW was asleep so we asked a nurse to wake him. He was groggy but very happy to see us. Even though he was physically deteriorating I could see that his mind was as sharp as even and his sense of humor was still there. I stuck my hand out to shake his hand and he held mine for a long time like he didn't want to let go. His hand felt cold and weak. I got emotional again and almost cried again but I held it in. I didn't want GW to worry so I put on a brave face and smiled. Before we left I told GW to get better soon and we'll be waiting for him at home. For the rest of the day I felt a bit melancholy and down. Seeing GW like that reminded me of how fleeting and fragile life is and it scared me.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPFO1AZC,,0.0

We went to the beach , ate at some fine restaurants and had a lot of talks together as a family.. As I like to cook I made breakfast every day and enjoyed it. We went sailing and visited some historical sites.

We drove there and picked up my daughter in Ralieh and then we met our other daughter at the house. I enjoyed getting up in the morning and watching the sun come up over the horizon.

I loved to wake her up early in the morning and sing her Happy Birthday before the sun had even started to peek over the horizon. 	  Being only August though the countdown for her birthday had not yet begun so my mom decided to try and beat it and get my sisters birthday shopping done early. So one Saturday morning my mom and I went to the mall to shop for my sister. We were at a store shopping for my sister when I saw a bright yellow advertising sign hanging from the ceiling which was an advertisement for Payless, that just happened to be on the opposite end of the mall from where we were. On the sign, there were the coolest slippers I had ever seen. They were massaging slippers in the shape of animals particularly the one on the sign was a pink unicorn. The slippers themselves were pink which made them even greater because that is her favorite color. As soon as I saw these breathtaking slippers I tugged on my mothers' sleeve and pointed at the sign. Without the slightest bit of interest she just merely glanced up at the sign and went back to what she was looking at, so I had kept my eye on that sign for the entire time we were in the store, not acknowledging a word my mom said to me the rest of the time. After my mother had finished and rung her gifts out I tugged on her arm to get her attention and said I had to go across the mall that I would meet her at the car. I hadn't told her what store I was going to or for what but she walked out the exit doors of the mall and I continued on my way to Payless. When I got there I looked around the store feverishly and still couldn't find the slippers I was looking for so I stopped an employee and asked her where they were. She pointed me in the direction of the far back of the store so I took off for that corner and when I got there I saw a pile of boxes with unicorn heads sticking out of them. So then I looked through the boxes for her size and when I found them I brought them up and paid for them and ran to the mall exit hoping I hadn't detained my mother in the car for too long. When I got there she had asked me what was in the bag and I showed her, she smirked and burst out laughing and offended I asked her what was so funny because I knew my sister would love them. She smiled and explained that my other sister had bought her a massaging neck warmer that was in the shape of a unicorn and was pink and she said that only sisters could pick out a perfect pair without even knowing what the other had  gotten.",3KWTYT0871PRAB6SPCRKG6N57BZ5L8,,0.0

It had been raining quite a bit recently, so the service berry bushes were full.  We enjoyed eating service berries as we walked.

I knew that there is a spring of water in the area, but I hadn't seen so many flying around at one time before!  We noticed a female deer resting among tall grass, but once she saw that we were no threat, she remained where she was.  We also saw ravens in a tree playing with little sticks. The weather was very nice that evening; it was nice to be outside with my spouse enjoying the fresh air. There was an avenue of blooming trees that we walked along, so fragrant.  The trees were also apparently full of wasps and bees, because they were buzzing so loudly!  Apparently we weren't the only ones enjoying the fragrant trees.  One thing that happened during the walk was that a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp it had caught!  It was big (both insects), and I was surprised to find out that dragonflies ate wasps. The dragonfly landed only briefly, and then flew away.

Although we visit several kinds of places such as Senior Citizens Daycare Centers, Schools for Disabled Children and Assisted- Living Homes, our favorite place to visit is Shriners Children Hospital.  When Sheriff and I do our weekly visit we actually put on a program in the hospital's auditorium. It is always amazing to me to see these happy children faces when I know they are battling serious, and sometimes terminal illnesses.  Just being in these children's presence is such a blessing and reminds me to appreciate each day. The program Sheriff and I do is quite interactive with the children, so when someone doesn't participate it is quite noticeable. About 6 months ago I would notice a young girl, probably about 7 years old, standing off to the side. She looked incredibly lonely and sad. I have learned over time to let the kids approach us or Sheriff as they deemed to be comfortable. Each week I would hold eye contact with  her for a little longer and subtly move a little closer to this girl, whose name I later learned is Rebecca.  It took about 4 weeks to get close to Rebecca, and finally one day when we were close I asked her if she would like to pet Sheriff. She approached us in a shy manner and gently put her hand on Sheriff's back. The following week she actually walked up to Sheriff and gave him a big hug. My heart felt so much overwhelmingly love for this girl. As time went on I spoke with Rebecca often and felt we had become close. It was with a heavy heart when I received a phone call from the director who asked is Sheriff and I would visit Rebecca in her room. She had become gravely terminal. It was a day of love but one of extreme sadness as well. Rebecca's mom told me that one of Rebecca's wishes was to see Sheriff. She told me that Sheriff brought so much happiness to Rebecca. That day I knew the power of Therapy Dog and what a difference they make in people's lives.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,,0.0

I experienced an overwhelming amount of excitement and gratefulness both to them and in general, which was difficult for me to control. Attendant emotions post-prison release are overwhelming with a significant amount of anxiety attached. I curbed my desire to be impulsive and let them guide me. We bought a few necessities then I treated them to a meal, then they drove me to a bus station. Leaving was tough, and Garth was about to cry, and I'll never forget this. I am in continued contact with him and he has flown to Charlotte for a week long visit, and will again soon. On the 16 hour bus trip I tried to read, but my mind and emotions were active and in shock of my new freedom. Mostly I looked out the window and thought about my future, my recent past, and my new opportunities. A Chicago transfer was my favorite part - I love Chicago architecture - but after the 3 hours of Chicago area traffic the ride became mostly rural. Once hitting West Virginia, the mountains inspired awe and appreciation in me. I had been most looking forward to this part of the trip, with beautiful hills for several hours. The temperature by the time I hit Charlotte was 40 degrees warmer than it had been in Milwaukee, astonishingly. Charlotte was a pleasant sight with nice architecture, and it now hit me that this would be my home for a couple of years.

Once we told our driver where our hotel was located, he informed us of the protest that was occurring near our hotel. He informed us that liberal protesters, members of a group named Anti-Fa, and members of Gay Pride groups were violently protesting near where we were staying. He assured us that this was normal for Portland. After our Lyft driver dropped us off we entered into our hotel and walked to the front desk. The front desk attendant reiterated the ongoing protests. My Wife and I got to our room, and opened the windows in time to see trucks carrying officers from the Department of Homeland Security speeding down the street toward the protests. News stations on the television were also covering the protests. Later my Wife and I left the hotel, in another Lyft in the opposite direction from the protests. By the evening the protesters had left. The very next morning, My Wife and I walked to the site of the protests, and it looked as if nothing had happened.

First, it was on the Fourth of July weekend, which is my son's favorite holiday and it meant I had to spend time away from my family because it was not an all ages party. Second, this weekend already takes a lot out of me because I hate the heat and the street fair, so I was already tired from trying to make up time missed with my son. I couldn't even take my wife because someone needed to be with my kid, so I was essentially going alone when compared to this vast network of friends that were totally hip and cool that my brother has met over the years. Regardless, I did decide to attend and I road into town with my aunt. We had a great conversation, actually, and it was very pleasant. I did also meet a couple that were friends of my brother and they felt similarly outcast.  The location was a rooftop bar and it was nice enough, but way too nice for someone like me who is not used to this luxury. The niceness of the bar alone was enough for me to feel as if I were a total outcast. This is my brother's lifestyle right now, though, so it made good sense to him and his fiancee. After the party was over, we had a smaller group dinner which gave me a lot more comfort. It was only about ten people and I enjoyed meeting his to-be father-in-law. This guy seemed wild, but also quite nice. I liked him a lot. When the family was made smaller in this setting, it was much better. Putting all this aside, though, I am glad I went - not for me, but for him. It was good to support his first steps into this new life.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H2Z9O5,,0.0

She asked me to help hand out water, direct people and pretty much just be a a Jill of all trades during the race. I agreed, mainly because she is a good friend and I wanted to keep her, and helped out during the running of the marathon race. I watched the runners when they passed by during the race and thought that I could do that if I trained. I decided, for no real reason other than it was a challenge, to train for and complete a marathon. After my decision I looked up online what the best ways of training for a long distance race were and started to implement them. I trained for a little less than a year. I ran in rain, heat, snow and, worst of all, ice. I hate the winter and detest being cold but I went out and did the work anyway. I had always been athletic, playing sports in college and staying in shape at the gym over the years, but training by myself for a marathon was an entirely different level of fitness. There were days that I literally had to talk myself into training. I would hype myself up, out loud, to make myself go run in the cold. I am sure my husband thought I was crazy as he would come into a room and I would be talking, loudly, to myself to force myself into going out and running 15 miles. There were moments that were sublime, moments that were horrendous but overall, when I ran the race I thought all the training was worth it. I was proud that I had set a goal and completed it all while making my 4 year old daughter a part of the process.

In the capital city of his state, so it's a pretty nice place to visit. Cultural and historical, with great food, and of course, most of his family. He had told our kids he would be taking them to California for vacation this summer, but then his father got sick. His dad, who lives in Mexico, was diagnosed with a type of cancer that is not curable, and expected life span is about 5 years at most. So on very short notice, about 2 days, my husband decided that we would all go to Mexico so he could see his dad and family. I am the one that does the packing for pretty much everyone, myself and 3 kids, and even my husband to an extent. I had to get the dog into a kennel and get everything ready for the trip. We had passports ready, so that was a big worry out of the way. The drive, and we do have to drive because 5 round trip tickets is unbelievably expensive, is anywhere from 16 to 22 hours, depending on how long it takes to cross the border. I always dread crossing because there is usually something we need to process, some paper we forgot, or we are one of the unlucky people who get to have all of our stuff searched. We got to the border without incident, and then I could feel my stomach tighten as we parked the car to go get our visitor permits. Thankfully, that went rather quickly, and we were back into the truck in a short time and ready to go into Mexico. We were very lucky and didn't get stopped for a search. The first border agent we saw didn't even ask for passports, but he is right at the crossing. There was one, i knew, coming up several miles later. Astoundingly, we were not bothered there, either. He checked our passports, not permits, and on we went. Since the crossing took such a minimal amount of time, we arrived in my husband's city in about 16 or 17 hours. It was a quick trip and we got to spend more time with family since there were no delays.",3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWVV452D,,0.0

I was shocked and confused. The vet advised me to have a test done to rule out any diseases or cancer. It was quite scary.  After researching the test online, I realized how dire this situation is.  I felt like I was in trouble and the anxiety and fear set in.  The test results took at least a week to get. I was an emotional wreck the entire time. I didn't sleep very much.  When they finally called and I heard those words ""she doesn't have cancer"", a weight suddenly lifted and I felt such relief. My dog wasn't going to die.  I could go back to being happy again.

There were not too many people there, it was was a nice little ceremony. I wish that more people on my brothers side were there. My brothers wife had a lot of family there which is fine. The after party was nice.  There was good food that were catered. All around the people there were nice as well. I think my brother was happy so that's all that matters. I had fun at the end of the day and it was a nice experience. It kind of made me wonder if I will ever get married and where.

It is a con hosted by a company called rooster teeth. I had been to this con about 5 years straight at this point. The year before I had met this girl there. We followed each other on Instagram and started talking. At first it was usually about school, work, or food. Next we started sharing memes with each other. Eventually I realize I was really into her. I didn't want to tell her cause I didn't know how he would react, so I kept it to myself. We were both going to attend the con again so we started planning things to do and places to eat, but I always included other people so it wouldn't be weird.  I arrived in Texas the Saturday before the con, and although she lived in Texas she didn't get off work til the next Tuesday. Tuesday comes and we were supposed to go to donuts together and i brought my friend along cause he liked donuts and so it wouldn't be weird. When we went to ramen and mini golf later we ere talking and poking each other but i didn't think much of it. Then we went to the bars drinking and that's when things hit off. First we were just sitting next to each other, then she grabbed my arm and put her head on my shoulder, then we were holding hands. Cause she got a bit drunk i told her she could stay at our loft which was right next to the bar we were at. She said ok and we slept(but didn't have sex) together. We kissed and the next day I ask her out. The kiss kind of gave me the indication but i told her my feelings and she said yes basically instantly.

Once we checked in we decided to go to the lobby bar for a drink. We then took our drinks into the van and the van took us to our rooms. After leaving our bags in our hotel rooms we then went to eat lunch at the buffet. It was the first time that my wife went to an all you can eat buffet. At first she was skeptical but then she said she enjoyed the food and how it was set up. We then went to to the pool area where there was a snack and drink bar with all you can eat snacks as well. We enjoyed our time there and swimming there was a blast. Afterwards we went to the night entertainment. It was there that we saw the different shows for kids and grown ups.

But I did not know him all that well due to a language barrier I had with him. I spoke only english while he strictly spoke spanish with a few words in english to convey what he was thinking at the moment; often times to make me laugh but with repetitive jokes. When I lost him, my family and I traveled down to south Texas in order to attend the funeral. The funeral was behind held by a catholic church, which allowed nearly everyone he knew in his life to come and join us. It was not as emotionally taxing as I thought it would have been until I saw him in his coffin, at which point I did become emotional. After we had buried him, we moved on with our lives. Nearly a year later, I sometimes think about him, but I still did not feel a connection towards him. The strangest part is that I have more of a connection with my grandmother, whom I rarely talk with anyways but has a stronger grasp on english. We are hoping to bring her and part of our extended family up with us to where we live. This will allow us to grow closer in the aftermath of losing my grandfather. The strangest part that I discovered is my grandmother doesn't feel much about losing her own husband. She has not cried since the funeral and finds the freedom from marriage to be far more enjoyable. This has made me reflect on my own life with a possible marriage, on what a partnership it would be.

He was sick and not doing to well. I usually don't get along with him very well and he usually tells me about how I make the wrong decisions in life. I tend to tune him out and not pay attention. When I went to go see him I felt different. He did not seem like the same person. It seemed like he was interested in talking to me and seeing how I was doing. He talked to me about our family history and I listened intently. I was very happy to hear him talk about his past. I felt more connected to him and felt like he wasn't trying to tell me what to do. I was pleased to be able to have a relationship with my dad that was less confrontational and more open. After we were done talking we sat at the table and had dinner and I had a good time. My mom was there and I could tell she was happy that we were getting along. When I finally had to go I thanked them and hugged my dad. I felt like we really turned a leaf on how we got along and from then on things would be different.,3MD9PLUKKJ0F5PT28DEFI2YPD56NZY,,0.0

We went snorkeling for the first time and had a wonderful time. The people were so friendly and the beaches were beautiful. We became very friendly with a few of the employees and were sad to leave.

Lots of people were at the game and added to the experience. It was exciting for me since I hadn't been to a game in awhile. I had struck up a few conversations with the people around us as well. We were above the visitor's dugout so we got to be very close to the action. After some exciting plays the home team was winning. However in the last inning it all fell apart and they lost.

The anxiousness and anxiety it caused was not good. It kept me from sleeping or focusing well, and also from working. I worried - will I need to take more pain medicine? Will the infection return? Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more. Now, I make sure to rinse daily with this unique mouth wash and so far it's been pretty positive. Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost. The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth. Wisdom Teeth come in around 17 years of age, or start to and eventually become impacted. Impaction leads to vision problems, pain, on site infection, and shifting teeth among other things. I have experienced some pain for years over this, but only recently, has it become so bad that it incapacitates me. While I personally do not want to undergo wisdom tooth extraction, I definitely recommend it if you suffer.",3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZI475QT,,0.0

As the weeks rolled by, the due date was coming closer and closer, and time seemed to move quicker too. I knew I was going to need lots of baby stuff, and a lot more money. I immediately started saving money, as well as working many more hours. Saving money wasn't the only hurdle I was going to have to overcome,  I also needed to move many hours away from where I was raised, and where my business was located. About a month before the due date my significant other decided that I could finally move up to where she was, I did not delay, and moved as quickly as I could. It took me three trips to move all of the baby stuff, and another trip to move my necessary belongings. Upon arriving,  I immediately setup the nursery for our soon to  arrive daughter. There were many other things to prepare,  like child proofing the house, and making sure that we were ready. I made tons of food, and froze them into individual servings, ensuring we would have proper caloric intake upon our return. I also made sure that our vehicles were in top operating condition. Before we knew it,  we were driving to the hospital. After two long days, our beautiful daughter was in our arms. It was the happiest day in my life,  and the beginning of my new family. A few days later we were able to go home, and start a new chapter of our lives.",3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJX4IOX2,,0.0

This one was special because we hit 18 years, and they weren't all easy, but we always stuck by each other's side. This was something that we were both looking forward to for weeks, mainly due to our busy schedules.  My wife and I both work full time, plus we have 3 kids, 2 who play multiple sports.  With all of this going on we never get date nights, even though we talk about them.  We never have time to get away and just have alone time.  We got to the restaurant, sat down, and put in our drink order.  We were instantly transformed back to the kids we were when we first fell in love.  I starred into my wife eyes and tried to say things to make her smile.  I love making my wife laugh, we sat there making each other giggle and reminiscing until our food came.  Afterwards we stayed a bit longer after paying the check, then went home a had a few more drinks, hanging out and laughing.  We get very few date nights and I always look forward to them.  Our anniversary is definitely something that can't get put off, so it's a time when no matter what comes up we make time for each other.

He has practiced for many years in music and doesn't give up.  He loves to play with others in band and orchestra.  He is caring and really wants to do his best.  A few years ago he started to not think straight at times.  His mind became foggy and he became more paranoid about life events.  He had to be put on medication because it became so severe.  The medication also had to be extremely strong as episodes lasted several months without respite.  Despite this he recovered and continued with the music.  He went to practice regularly and attended a concert.  I was so proud of him for keeping on going and working hard.  He did something few there even understood because they had been hidden from his reality.  They saw him practice, but didn't know the true events underneath.  Not many could understand the hardships and perseverance.  This was an accomplishment I'll never forget as tears welled in my eyes.",37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZXR5AJB,,0.0

He tells us that's how the Japanese do it and we cannot tell him off. When we went to the board walk their is a large fairground. It has mainly adult rides. He is aged only 7 and his very tall for his age. He showed no fear and wanted to ride all of the adult rides where as a lot of his little friends did not. It was chaotic looking after all those kids but everyone enjoyed the day. It was along day and the weather was really quite warm. But we decided to go to the beach area that had a good breeze. But the area was very busy it took us a while to find a parking space. We ended up paying $35 dollars which I thought was a little high for a few hours parking.

I may not remember as many details. The wedding took place on a farm that belonged to my cousin's father-in-law. Since there were no trees around, it was nice and quiet and quite beautiful. It was very hot, and the reception being held in a nearby metal barn didn't help either. The bathrooms were in a trailer that was air conditioned, so that was nice. I was able to see family from Chicago, England, LA, and other places I don't normally get to see. It was fun watching my dad have to squirm while he interacted with brothers he doesn't particularly care for. They had an issue with food running out, so my aunt had to call a local pizza place for an emergency order. In the end it all worked out. The ceremony was nice, and my cousin looked beautiful in her dress. I felt like I was sweating too much due to the heat, and the pictures I'm in I don't look too good in. In an odd turn of events, I never actually got to speak to her husband, even though we were in a picture together. But I understand they were very busy that day and had a lot of guests to interact with. Overall I had a very good time at the wedding.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA84RJUXP,,0.0

He pretends to be a cat, he plays with his cats, he runs around meowing and grooming himself, basically anything a child can do to emulate a cat, he does.  For the last year he has had two cats and always talked about wanting more, always asking if we could get another, pointing out how he would be able to care for another anytime the opportunity arose.  I, as his mom, had said no to any more cats numerous times.  I was dead set against getting anymore, two was enough to feed and care for and buy litter for them to use.  Near my son's seventh birthday his father, my exhusband, called me up and asked if I was interested in a free cat.  My immediate response was no, I was not interested in having another cat in the house.  Then my ex said the cat was going to be a ragdoll, and my immediate no became an enthusiastic yes.  I had previously been interested in getting a rag doll kitty, I knew they were prized for the soft coats and gentle temperaments, and I knew they were sold for thousands of dollars.  Hearing that I could get one for free was amazing and I was not going to miss out on the chance to own a ragdoll.  She came home to us the weekend before his birthday and the humans here loved her immediately.  The other two cats took a little while to warm up to her, but they did.  Now it's commonplace to find them snuggled up to each other sleeping, or darting around playing together like furry little streaks of thunderous kitty running rampage. The cost of caring for three cats is somehow exponentially more than only two, but I wouldn't trade my new kitty for any amount of money in the world.  In this short time she has became a family member and you cannot put a price on your family members.",30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A,,0.0

I remember watching him get ready. Fussing over his clothes and hair but trying to hide that from us. He looked so handsome in his bright green gown. I remember his, then, girlfriend was going to be there and he was a little shy about us meeting her. He was anxious to leave that day but also acting like it was no big deal to rush. In the car ride over he sat in the back seat with his siblings. They sang songs from camp. The younger two were in awe and a bit of envy over their big brother. We all felt so proud. Pulling up to the school I took a minute to take it all in. A sea of young teenagers in green gowns, feeling accomplished, all funneled into one place. The setting was meant to be formal but it was comically ironic how ""cheap"" a lot of it seemed. Once all of the students came in it was impossible to tell any of them apart. I sat through the few hundred names letting my attention wander off to his first day of school. A handful of bad days that involved tears over the years. But I also thought about how proud and excited I was for him. And entire lifetime of opportunity and experiences lay before him.

We enjoyed the flames licking at the logs and the warmth spreading out from the fire. We made smores and had a few drinks, spending most of our time just talking laughing and joking about life. At my house I have motion sensor lights. One night when we were sitting in the back yard around the bonfire one of the motion sensor lights kept going on and off. The odd thing about this was that it had never acted that way before. Talk around the bonfire went to ghosts and spirits, we joked that there may be a ghost trying to get our attention. Laughingly she said ""We see that you are here and recognize your presence."" After that the light did not go on again. This was something that we both found interesting, it's like she acknowledged whatever was going on and it was happy to be acknowledged it. The night was uneventful after that but it was the topic of conversation for the next few days, even though we had bonfires after that, we didn't experience that situation for any of those other bonfires. The other thing we enjoyed tremendously was going to Ren Fest. It was hot and humid that day but we both dressed as different Steam Punk characters. There were so many different things to look at and enjoy, we got to experience the fire whip, the jousting and the comedy troop. We spent hours just going through the different shops, enjoying the wares that were sold. And the food, don't get me going on the turkey legs, we spent so much time stuffing our faces with the different specialty foods that when we came home we both joked we would need too go on a diet.

It's been a long time since I've seen her so sad. She had recently finished speaking to Aunt Rue in New Jersey on the phone when I noticed how low her mood was. When I asked, she told me she had just learned really disturbing news. According to Aunt Rue, my cousin Deena -- who is my mother's and aunt's niece -- has apparently joined what other family members described as a ""cult."" We don't live in the same state and visit close to never, so it's not surprising that all of us up East were a bit suspicious of the claims. We thought the family Down South was exaggerating the situation... that is, until we went down to see for ourselves. Shockingly, we soon learned, they were not stretching the truth in the least. Deena, always a husky if not somewhat fat person, had lost so much weight we could barely recognize her. Her house, always pristine and inviting, was now a veritable dump with stuff just thrown haphazardly everywhere. The saddest part was that she seemed oblivious to how all of this looked to other people. Months later we still have not figured out how to get through to Deena.  She has resisted every attempt to break through her wall and help her understand how dangerous and unhealthy her predicament is. The family Down South continues to monitor her as closely as possible while attempting to not appear like they are stalking her, which makes her defensive, angry and argumentative. Meanwhile, the rest of us are seeking professional advice because it has become increasingly certain that we cannot get through to her on our own. Sad, perplexing situation all around.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO,,0.0

Since he enjoys staying at hotels, I booked a room at a luxury hotel for a weekend getaway. I did not tell him before we checked-in to the hotel, but I had chosen this hotel because it had a large, heated indoor pool. We got to our room and I immediately opened my suitcase and pulled out his swimming trunks, that I had packed in secret.  We changed into our swim clothes and headed down to the pool. As we approached the pool, we both noticed that there was also a whirlpool located next to the pool. I was elated! My husband suffers from back pain and the whirlpool would certainly made him feel good. We swam for quite a while, then relaxed in the whirlpool. After we got back to our room, we both were extremely hungry and we agreed that a steak dinner was what we wanted. We ate our favorite steaks along with baked potatoes and creamed spinach.  For dessert, my both had the most delicious chocolate cake that we'd ever eaten. After dinner, I gave him directions to a nearby movie theater, where we planned to see a remake of one of his favorite movies, The Lion King. The theater featured state of the art video and sound, but when we entered the theater to take our seats, I was astonished to see that all of the seats were overstuffed leather recliners that changed position with the touch of a button. Again, this made me particularly happy because of my husband's back issues, sitting for long periods of time can be painful for him. I was sure that he would be very comfortable in his seat and would be able to enjoy the movie thoroughly, which he was and he did.  The sound and video quality, along with the comfort of the seats made us decide that we would never go to different theater ever again. All in all, the weekend was a great success because my husband had a fantastic time.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX75HES,,0.0

We wanted to fulfill our obligations though, so we performed at a large outdoor festival. I had been wondering what I'd do with my time, and I was also concerned my partner would have some direction forward. We played, but I guess due to nerves we rushed through our set with time to spare. Someone in the crowd asked my partner to play one of her solo songs. I was so happy her own work was appreciated. I got off stage as she played. I got into conversation with some people who are in another local band I like. Without knowing the duo was splitting, they suggested I ""try out"" for them. Really, a formality. They wanted me in. It was pretty remarkable that in a matter of minutes, both her direction forward and mine were made clear. I was relieved. I was also excited we could part with no bad feelings. Once she got off stage, I told her what happened. She was happy for me. I was happy for her.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950T2C6B0,,0.0

He could hear hissing behind a board. He came in to tell me what was going on and I told him to leave whatever it was alone and bring the dog in. Well, as it turns it out, it was a small kitten. Later, when he let the dog out, he went crazy again. Again, my son went to check what was going on. The kitten did not take the opportunity to leave when the dog was inside. So, my son decided to help this kitten, he removed the board the kitten was hiding behind and pick up the cat. Once the dog saw the cat, he went crazy again. This spooked the kitten and it clawed up and bit my son. My son came inside with cat scratches all over, including a deep one on his lip, and had a rather deep puncture bite wound on his hand. We went to the ER, my son ended up on powerful antibiotics and a few stitches in face. The kitten was captured and sent for quarantine and testing for rabies. Not long after, my son's lymph nodes in his groin area started swelling. We went to the urgent care and they put him on antibiotics. The lymph nodes did not go down, but instead more started swelling.  Our regular doctor put him on a second, more powerful antibiotics. That didn't help and now lymph nodes in his neck started swelling. Doctor sent him for an ultrasound and the lymph nodes were extremely swollen and it was recommended to get a CT from waist to neck. Lymph nodes from groin to neck were all swollen. Our doctor told us he was 85% certain he had cancer. Not just cancer, but an extremely aggressive cancer. The surgeon removed the first, extremely large lymph node and told us it didn't not look like cancer, that he thought it was cat scratch fever, but we had to wait for the results. Our regular doctor was still certain it was cancer. Turns out my son had a massive case cat scratch fever.",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXALB4X,,0.0

The most suprising thing to me was the fact that it happened and the emotions I felt. It is unreal when something so painful happens, that you think will never happen. I also never knew the strength of negative emotions I could feel. I thought I knew pain before, but I was never remotely close to feeling real pain. There were many sleepless nights spent crying, and feeling like I was just going to fall over and die. The extreme anxiety and panic attacks I experienced were terrible. I look back wondering how I made it through. After surviving the worst time period of my life I learned that I can take something awful and get some good form it. I think the only way to survive something so bad it to find a way to see something good come from it. I am able to help others, and connect with other bereaved parents who have helped me survive. I can be that person who saves someone from going down the wrong path to handle grief. There have been a couple people who were here for me in that way. That is the best way to handle a bad situation. You have to find something positive to take from it, and use it in a good way.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4XKVKT1,,0.0

This was about my relationship with my ex and how it turned out poorly and led to some bad self doubt. My ex and I started out fantastically as friends and unfortunately that is where it should have stayed. We began well enough, having stayed up night after night chatting with one another and gaming with one another. We were young, love struck and despite some flawed starts of jealousy from both sides, we did well at first. Then after the relationship became official it became a nightmare to even survive within. This was after my previous relationship where I royally messed up in the emotional support department and let somebody nice down, so I was more than prepared to endure here as a, I guess, makeup for the last. However, that kindness was taken advantage of and I was manipulated, lost friends and stopped talking to people I once contacted daily. Likewise my personal hobbies deteriorated and I was more or less told to spend every waking moment with them. I cannot personally state all the things that went on, or the ways I was kept in the relationship because I feel like those are too personal, but needless to say I basically hated it. I had to wait for her to get bored of me, find another person to obsess over and let her dump me for things to be peaceful. So I exited that as a mess, both relationship wise and mentally. Hated them in general for the longest time and wondered if I did things wrong. Kind of hard to believe the person I met turned out to be like that, so I blamed myself for it at times. However, over time I learned that it wasn't my fault, I let it go and moved on. There's no easy way to do it, but you just have to take the blow, accept the time lost and stop letting more time slip away due to it. Thankfully I met somebody who would help me with that and she has been amazing. I really wish I could say all the ways she is, but I only have three thousand characters here! So I will say this. She's stubborn, dependable, cocky at times and had humor that matches mine. She's flawed, yet perfect if that makes sense. I didn't make her out to be unrealistic in my mind and she never required it either, so I'm happy to be with her. With this one I can move on without worry and know that even if something happens, it's not the end of the world.",3QRYMNZ7FZ3JJDK32LPXWEX8S9KTNO,,0.0

I wanted to plan something special for my daughter's second birthday. So I began saving to take my husband and daughter to the zoo. I began doing more surveys and spend less money. When it arrived  three days before the end of the my husband  informed me that we were short for rent. We had been struggling financially for a long time. And God has always provided a way for us to overcome. I immediately  new I had to cancel my plans and use the money I saved for  rent. I accepted the fact that it was a part of life that we were not going to go, and I would just have to save the money again.  To my surprise a few days later I got a call from my husband's parent. They decided to surprise us and take us to the zoo. I was extremely grateful, for their generosity. We haven't done anything fun in a longtime, so I was excited for what was to come. It was fun to see the joy in her face when she saw all the different animals. It gives me hope that one day I can repay his parent's for their kindness.",3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7B60F41,,0.0

We are still very close and have kept in touch. Her first husband died. I was so happy she found another great guy. When she asked me to be a bridesmaid I was so excited! I spent the whole weekend with her getting ready. We had such a good time! We went to get our nails done and have massages. We went out to eat with her family and the rest of the bridal party. I met some new friends and had a great time. The day of the wedding was actually a lot of fun. The pictures were beautiful and we had fun doing them. It was pretty relaxed getting ready. The wedding itself was beautiful. I read some scripture at the wedding. Afterwards the reception was so much fun! The food was wonderful. We had a lot of fun at a photo booth as well.,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K,,0.0

My sister and I went to the cemetery where my father is buried to make arrangements to have her interred. It was a very sad, difficult week as she'd been on life support and we'd had to make the decision to remove her from the respirator. The doctors said she'd only live a few hours but she lived for several days and seemed really uncomfortable and in pain. It was a very difficult thing to watch and my sister and I were both kind of traumatized when we walked into our meeting with the funeral director. We knew that my mother had asked for a simple graveside service as most of her friends had passed away. We explained this to the funeral director and she really put pressure on us to upsell everything. We keep refusing, wanting to keep it simple, and this woman made us feel so uncomfortable - and cheap, which we aren't - that I was starting to get upset. After more than an hour of this woman pressuring us we finally made the arrangement we'd planned. We then went out to lunch just to recover from the verbal pummeling of this woman. The day finally arrived and after picking up flowers we got to the cemetery early. The service itself was nice. It was a pretty spring day and quite a few family members came. The funeral director was nice to us, which was a change from when we made the arrangements. Despite the awful experience of planning this it turned out well.",3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCTG1EQY,,0.0

I went to see my family doctor and he told me that my condition as a diabetic has worsened. I felt confused because I've been doing my best to live a healthier life style. He said because of my past eating mistakes that my condition is worse and my medication would be changed to a higher dosage. I'm frantic about this. How do I get the energy I need to keep my job and family secure? I'm having trouble remembering things that I read . I'm having to write more things down. This is depressing me, I want my life back. I will figure this out, it will not beat me. I put on my face every morning that tell the world I'm doing great. If only everyone knew that its a lie. Or that I cry myself to sleep at night because I'm afraid. I see my sister in my dreams being taken from us because of diabetes. What if it takes me to, what will happen to my children? Writing this down everyday helps me cope with my fears. I hope I find the strength to conquer them. My father taught me to never give up. I wish he was still with us. I need him right now.

I would consider an amusement park during a summer day significantly before making that decision again.  But again, it is not a day that I regret. The car ride was nice, no arguing! No trouble parking or being admitted into the park. The wait times for everything was reasonable. We rode everything we possibly could to make the most of the day. We ate well. We laughed, we talked, we just enjoyed everything we could while we were there. But at the end of they day, we were so tired. The feet hurt, had been hot all day, the a/c in the car felt so amazing.

My sister and I drove up to Bellevue, Washington to spend some time with family.  It was a mini reunion.  My sister in law lives in Bellevue.  The people that came were my brother, his two boys, his ex wife, myself and my sister.  We had a great day planned.  When we first got there, we enjoyed a bit of wine and some great appetizers that my sister in law had made.  She always has the nicest ""spread"".  Then we went on with our day to go wine tasting.  We went to a small town named Woodinville.  Woodinville is a quaint little town that is known in Washington for wine tasting.  The drive was beautiful.  Summer in Washington is such a lovely time compared to the hideous rain!!!!  The first winery we went to was where we tried a wine called mead. It is a wine made with honey.  It was too sweet for me.  We went to a few other wineries and settled down at one that we thought we'd enjoy.  We all sat outside at a table covered by an umbrella.  Our server brought us a selection of different wines.  We fully enjoyed them as well as the conversation.  It's so fun to get together and talk about our lives.  I remember that after that we were getting hungry, so decided to go back to Bellevue to eat.  We located an Italian restaurant that looked inviting.  It turned out to be a disaster because the server/service was incredibly slow.  It was surprising that a restaurant like that was so slow because it was so highly rated!

This is a story of one of those times in my life. That very night I had the good fortune to have the entirety of my tax return get deposited into my account. I decided to ask my friend if they wanted to hang out. They said yes and so I ventured to their house to hang out. Well I did have to leave at some point and ended up meeting a random man on the street. After we got to talking I decided to stop inside of a 7-11 to grab some cups. I was excited to hang out with a random stranger, but, then, things very suddenly changed. A man walked up to me, demanded my wallet, and, upon me giving him the wallet, stabbed me multiple times with a box cutter. There are very few more surprising things that can happen than suddenly finding yourself being the victim of a violent crime in a convenience store. Now as you can surmise by me typing this I did in fact survive. In fact, I wasn't seriously injured at all. However, now I got to spend my evening at a hospital around the corner. Instead of drinking with a random guy in the street now I was suddenly being put under for exploratory surgery. As anyone who has ever been in a car crash or gotten their identity stolen can attest to, once the shock and the trauma wear off, it just turns into a bunch of errands you have to run. After spending the next few months recovering there were a few things I had to do. I had to have an ultimately fruitless, albeit intimidating, interview with the police after the fact. The only other thing that I had to do, quite luckily, was, go through the rather Kafkaesque process of attempting to find a therapist. This, more than the interview, more than the stabbing, more than the recovery, more than the surgery, ended up being the most labor intensive part of the whole experience.",3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD,,0.0

When I went to pick him up, she casually mentioned that his arm seemed to hurt.  So I watched him all night, and noticed that he wouldn't use his arm at all.  His arm just dangled there like a wet noodle.  I had a friend and her daughter for a sleepover.  And while the kids were playing on the slide, my son bumped his arm, and started crying and would not stop.  That's when I knew that something must be really wrong with him.  While I felt guilty, it was night time so I knew the only option would be either to keep him at home or take him to the ER.  I thought going to the ER would be more traumatic than helpful so I just put some ice on his arm, and put him into bed with me.  After I got him settled down, he was able to go to sleep.  In the morning he was back to his normal self, except he still wouldn't do anything with his arm. So I took him into urgent care because I knew that they could do x-rays if need be.  The doctor asked me questions about how it happened, and I felt bad because I didn't know how it happened.  I told her we thought that he fell off the coffee table, but we weren't entirely sure, since no one saw what happened.  In the end, it turned out that he had broken his left arm.  I felt guilty, but he was in really good spirits about it.",3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H4CNTZG,,0.0

It was about an hour long but it seemed to last forever. At some point the nerves went away and I was just happy to have finished a very hard phd and happy that I made my parents Proud. The rest of the day was also very positive. We had dinner as a family at a nice restaurant. We then sat and talked for a few hours. I told my family stories of the struggles and tough times during those five years. The offered feedback and told me I had done a great job. I admit this felt so good!

It was a ton of work preparing for the move as well as the move itself. I'll never forget it because this was a huge milestone in our lives and our very first big move.   We had to start by packing boxes of our lesser used items many weeks in advance. We then started to shop around for furniture, as this was our first move to our own place. The shopping was a lot of work itself because we had no idea what theme or look we were going for. We also were on quite a bit of a budget so it was tricky finding nice furniture within our price range. When the moving date got closer we had to decide whether we would use a moving company or rent a Uhaul. Fortunately my partner's father agreed to drive a Uhaul to our new apartment an hour away. When our big day finally arrived we had a lot of loading to to! I was surprised at just how much of a work out I would get from all the lifting. We made multiple trips to and from our new apartment loading and unloading. The rest of the day then consisted of setting up as much furniture as we could. As night drew near only my partner's mom was still over to help clean and unpack some things.  After she left, the most memorable moment of the whole move happened. My partner and I turned to each other and both whispered ""we did it!"" as we got to enjoy our new home together, just her and I, for the first time.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAUX5WG9,,0.0

I remember having trouble sleeping the night before because I was so nervous about how I would perform, so when I woke up with only 5 hours of sleep, I felt like I was already setting myself up to fail. I was told over and over by my coaches and parents that this was just a competition and there was no shame in losing because at least I'd be learning something, however it was to no avail. I am very competitive, so it didn't really click in my head. When I got to the venue where it was being held, I felt like time was moving too fast, and soon I'd have to compete. I couldn't stop fidgeting. Eventually, it was finally my turn to compete. When I won my first match, I felt on top of the world. Then, I won another, and it felt even better. The momentum I started to build during my matches that day helped me build the confidence I needed to win my final match for that day. Sure enough, I did it. I was so ecstatic but I tried to remain calm so I didn't disrespect my opponent by celebrating. I hugged my parents and coaches and all of my teammates. It was only a white belt level competition, but I was still proud. It showed how hard I'd been working.",3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZW52QJ,,0.0

My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side. That's how I'm dealing with the aftermath of my eviction currently.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,,0.0

It all started when my little brother and sister were on their way home from school. While coming home they ran into these thugs from another school. It was around 10 of them and just my little brother and sister. So these thugs were getting ready to bank them however I could hear this all happening and ran out side and chased them all away. We called the police nothing was done. A few weeks past and 3 of them came back and broke my window. I tracked them down with another brother and said why u break my window. Next thing you know its about 15 of them now wanting to fight us because we are white. We knew we couldn't fight some minors so we ran home but they chased us. We were banked by all of them. All they wanted to do is cause terror and fight. We called the cops because my brother did get punched by one in the face and of course they broke the window. The cops took for ever to get here and when they did the thugs ran away. However the cops had the audacity to say it was our own problem. And the one who broke the window was right in front of the cop calling him a profanity and the cop did not even arrest him. This was very surprising the police officer knowing this was the thug who committed the crime did nothing and let him run away. The only thing that stopped these thugs from coming back and harassing us was going to their school and it all stopped.,3RYC5T2D74F66JJOEBXU0O1L6SMRPJ,,0.0

Our bodies are wonderfully designed with complex pathways designed to eliminate toxins. As apart of my self-learning, I began to research the supplement, alpha-lipoic acid. Convinced that this supplement could be beneficial, I began taking this common supplement. If one believes the hype, one could expect miraculous improvements in one's health if detoxification is impaired.  Upon taking the supplement, I noticed unexpected physical responses that were not in line with improvement in health. This caused me to dig deeper into this supplement. In the process, I came across the knowledgeable scientist from Quicksilver Scientific, Dr. Christopher Shade. It was during one of his presentations that I learned how the body can have blocks in detoxification as a result of exposure to toxic mold. This surprising fact caused a light bulb to go off in my mind. I had personal experience with toxic mold exposure, and this fact led me to believe that my unexpectedly lackluster response to alpha-lipoic acid may be due to a mold-induced block in my own detoxification system. Thankfully, there are good strategies for dealing with this sort of block in detoxification, and products designed carefully and comprehensively to assist in maximizing activation and functioning on the detoxification system. I encourage any reader to explore the Quicksilver Scientific range of detox products, and especially the Push Catch System, as well as to take advantage of the available teaching resources and seminars presentations available online from Dr. Christopher Shade.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N,,0.0

I had been working as a salesman at my store for a number of years and always wanted to become a manager there.  I spoke with the manager and he said that there would be positions that would be opened soon so try your best and I would be evaluated.  I did more work than usual for a number of months to strive for a promotion. I helped more customers and took on more responsibilities. I worked in the office such as organizing inventory and organized store promotions.  When the time came, I got the promotion and was grateful.  It showed that hard work pays off and you will be rewarded.  Due to the promotion, I was able to move to a better apartment.  I also was able to afford a new car which helped greatly because I had to rely on taking the bus previously.  I had more responsibilties but I enjoyed it.  I worked with my staff to make the store better.  I instilled my work ethic into my employees.  My promotion gave me confidence to do my job the best possible.  I only wish i would have received a promotion sooner.",3VNL7UK1XG57VL7M4X6KO9OZQIZFT4,,0.0

She got her learners permit in the mail yesterday and has been asking to go ever since. We were going to pick up my son, but left early and found a church parking lot nearby. It reminded me of the times when my mom and I would go to the high school parking lot and I would drive with her. My daughter was very nervous and I had trouble convincing her to take her foot off of the brake.  After a while, she calmed down somewhat and she was off. Initially, she was having trouble accelerating and braking smoothly. I soon realized that it was her shoes! She had worn flip flops to her first driving lesson. We then pulled over and she found a pair of tennis shoes in the trunk. After that, it was much smoother driving. We worked on turns and braking. We even did some parking lessons. I also went over the dashboard features and would quiz her on the names of certain things. She did a great job and we worked on a lot of things. I am very proud of her and how seriously she is taking the privilege of driving a vehicle. I am sure she is going to be a terrific driver.",3G2UL9A02E0OEUH4Q10FP7J4AC376X,,0.0

Her son, my best friend, has terminal brain cancer. I obliged. I took everything out of storage that they would want. I packed it into his car and drove 2700 miles across the country. When I got there, he was in ICU because he suffered a seizure while I was on the road.  The entire week I spent every day in the hospital with him and his family.  I spent more time there than I did with my own family.  They felt comforted because their other son is living in another country and couldn't be there.  Also, most friends didn't know that he was even sick with cancer.  I was able to inform everyone I knew that he was in the hospital and I got them to come visit. I felt like I was sending out an army to help him and his family.  After the week was over, I flew back across the country to where I live. I continue to check up on them.",3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UPXRZ8H,,0.0

We got lost and were very confused as to which way to go because we weren't used to international traffic signs. Also in the area we were in there weren't a lot of road signs navigating us back to major points of interest. I was exceedingly nervous as the area we were in didn't look very safe. I was driving and my mom was navigating us. I was getting more and more upset because it was getting late in the day. My mom kept telling me to call down but I couldn't. She finally told me to pull the car over and we were trading places. As She got into the driver's side, she actually drove off and left me there on the street corner! She figured out where to go and came back and got me, but I was completely freaked out by that point. My mom was cracking jokes and asking me if I really thought she would leave me there!

When he turned 18 he began doing local programs with the police where he could train in community programs. At the same time, he attended college and obtained his criminal justice degree. By the time he graduated, he had several years of experience with the local police program, a criminal justice degree, and a clean record. He applied to become a Sheriff and he was chosen out of dozens of applicants. There were six people hired total and my brother was one of them and I can remember when he broke the news to the family. He sent a message in the family chat on Facebook where our family members communicate. The message informed us that he had been accepted by the Sheriff's office and would be having a commissioning ceremony next month. The ceremony began at 7 am but I arrived 45 minutes early. I talked with my grandparents in the parking lot of the Sheriff's office while we waited for the others to arrive. At about 7 am, a Sheriff came to the gate and let in the group of family members which had swelled to include the family of the other applicants. We were led through the Sheriff's office where we saw all kinds of memorabilia including old photos, awards, and memorials.  Finally, we arrived in a conference room where my brother was waiting with the other applicants. After a brief speech, the Sheriff himself arrived and gave a speech of his own about how family is what is most important and the reason why they do the job they do. Lastly, the Sheriff pinned badges onto each of the six new Sheriffs including my brother finalizing their acceptance in the program. Sadly, were not allowed to visit afterwards because they had to begin training right away. We had planned to go to breakfast with my brother in celebration but our plans were not to be.

But not today I was able to get the ring.  I needed it that night to ask her to marry me as well.  So with the ring nervously in my pocket we went to dinner and I dont think she even knew.  It finally came time to ask her and people were seemingly ready to leave.  So I had to do it.  I had to finally ask her or I'd have to find another time and be super nervous all over again.  She said yes!  We were pretty happy to share the moment with my family, her family and our son.  The resturant printed off the menu for us and it said congrats to us.

It's been 17 days since it was finished. I'm still heartbroken and completely lost in terms of the direction my life takes from here. I made the gigantic mistake of basing the fundamental pieces of my existence on my marriage and my partner. I found I was content as long as love was present in my life. That nothing else mattered; such as money, status, material objects, vacations, houses, etc as long as I had my wife. The betrayal stings like nothing has ever stung before. Although my fault, I have been almost completely robbed on my independence. When I say that, I refer to my living situation. I was living near, but away from family for the last 8.5 years and enjoying every moment of my 'freedom'. Now I live with my brother & grandmother, and nothing feels quite right anymore. I'm stuck between this rock and hard place about seeking out another individual to build anything with. My trust has been used up, my life has been changed drastically, and I have lost the person who said for over 8 years that she didn't believe in divorce. This experience flat out sucks. And while I hold all of the power on how to feel about the situation itself, as well as myself, it's difficult to adapt to something I didn't want to willing cooperate with.

Pictured Rocks is a beautiful location. The sights are amazing. From starting in the woods, to crisscrossing rivers, to spotting waterfalls, all the way to the Pictured Rocks themselves. The titular Pictured rocks are sheer cliffs on the shore of Lake Superior. They have great coloring that gives them their name. Gazing over them is a memorable experience. Looking hundreds of feet down into the clear and turquoise waters is stunning. Lake Superior is always a sight to behold, but here is where she shines best. I really do love it there. The hike itself is fairly easy even despite a bump or two. Though, it was a bit muddy being spring. There were moments of tiptoeing and leaping around mucky mud. But it just added to the adventure. Rain was a possibility throughout the morning but it held off and the temperatures were cool and perfect. Just an all around great experience that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend the area.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV,,0.0

I was a part of the wedding party. It was a lot of catching up with people I hadn't seen in awhile. It was more emotional than I expected.  I have been friends with him since high school and I have become very close to his wife in the last ten years.  It was at a very beautiful location with a waterfall in the background.  We spent the previous night at their house having a barbecue and drinking. That morning we went to eat at a great burger place and we basically drank the entire day. It was a lot of dancing once the reception came about. I danced the night away with a lot of the bridal party. I think the groom just wanted to have a party. I don't think he particularly wanted a wedding, but he really likes to party. The embarrassing moment was very embarrassing for me. It was during the time when people made toasts. I went to toast and I ended up breaking the glass in front of the entire audience. It was a royal embarrassment.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45U77Q6NI,,0.0

He was at this job for about three months and we get kept running into walls with his benefits and pay.  We were both keeping our chins up and dealing with it.

He is one of the better climbers in our group, so we didn't think it would be too hard for him. He started up confidently, and was climbing with ease.

We heard a loud crack when he hit the ground , and knew instantly what happened. He broke his leg. We all rushed to his aid, and tried to support the broken leg as best we could. We had no choice but to help him down the hill which was quite a distance. We ended up making it back to the car, and we drove him to the hospital.

It was such a lovely trip. We took a boat ride a sunset over the beautiful water and were able to see the parliament building lit up at night. We ate absolutely amazing food. I had initially been worried they had a very meat-centric diet, and as a vegetarian I thought I wouldn't get to enjoy authentic dishes but I had some delicious goulash and many other unique plates at restaurants. I bought a jacket that I absolutely love one day when were walking down the street of our airbnb. We stumbled upon a hole in the wall thrift shop, it had such beautiful pieces. I easily could have bought many things but settled for a cute vibrant blue cropped blazer. I have worn it many times since and always get complements. My friend and I still talk about the trip to this day, we had such an amazing time together. Our feet were about to fall off from all the walking we did, but it truly gave us the best experience in seeing the most we could in our short time. One of the most surprising and beautiful moments of the trip was definitely when we went to the fisherman's lookout. I had not known what to expect because one moment we were on level ground and the next we came out of a tunnel that offered us the most stunning view of Budapest and the river. We had a cocktail at the top and just soaked in the beauty of the moment. That had to be one of my favorite moments of the trip.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD37FED1,,0.0

I think that memory will always be burned into my mind.  It changed the way that I feel about myself, some of those little nagging self beliefs that have hung around since childhood are finally gone. We are saving for a down payment on a home.  We're almost there and we've been looking at the most adorable lake houses.  I can just see myself, sitting on the back porch, watching kids play or fish.  I can picture us having days on the lake in a boat, relaxed and carefree.

You would think that this would make it easy for everyone to attend.  My husband and I live about an hour and a half from where we grew up.  The date of the party also fell on my actual birthday, because there were no other good dates to hold it.  One by one, as the date of the party got closer, they began to call and say they wouldn't be able to make it.  The morning of the party I got a call from my sister-in-law who basically said she just didn't feel like driving to the party that day.  My husband's parents also called and made up a reason to not come.  I got that phone call while I was inline picking up food I ordered for the party.  It would have been nice to know with a few more days in advance.  I could have ordered half the amount of food and saved some money.  The saddest part is, my children don't even notice that they aren't there.  It doesn't even occur to them that their grandparents would come to their parties, because this certainly isn't the first and it won't be the last that they missed.  It is causing me a lot of heartache because I would like to repay them in the same manner when it comes to family get togethers, but my husband thinks we need to be the better person.  I feel differently.  I don't see why we must keep rewarding their poor behavior.  To me, they have made a choice not to be involved in my family's lives, so why bother to reach out to them anymore than they do to us?  The phone line and the roads go both ways.",3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXK1A03F,,0.0

Worries of how you’ll perform as a parent are overwhelmed as you look into their eyes and you know it’s going to be OK. Kids call you to a higher level of living.  I cried when my daughter was born.  These weren’t quiet, demure tears. They were big, breathless sobs. The very air sucked out of me as I held my baby, her own squalling cries drowning out my own. I was overwhelmed. I had never felt so much before. Conventional parenting wisdom says the day your child is born is one of the happiest of your life.  At the time I didn’t feel happy. I barely knew what I felt at all.  I was filled with an indescribable emotion—some mix of everything all at once. I was awed. I was humbled. I was proud.  I loved myself then more than I ever had before. I couldn’t be all bad if I had created something so small and precious. I held her and let myself be swept away by the feeling. I laughed—and even laughed as I cried.  I didn’t know I could love so much. I didn’t know anything in the world could be so important to me and so worth protecting. But, when she was born, something in me changed.",3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN21GHPFE,,0.0

It is a feeling like no other that something so big finally belongs to you. Excitement, and comfort of being able to say this is my home. It was a long process, buying a home. The first thought was to buy a house, but due to my husbands bankruptcy everything had to be put into my name. We found the home in Charlevoix Estates which is a Mobile home community. It is a double wide with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. It has an Island in the kitchen, and a huge closet off the master bedroom. This is the first home that we have purchased for our family. We are over the moon excited about finally getting to have a place of our own. It feels like a dream come true. I am really excited about having Air conditioning throughout the whole house. That is great for us. Moving was challenging, getting everything out of our old house and moved into the new one. We have so much stuff, so it took a little bit of effort to get in and get settled.

But after multiple doctors appointments, they all said the same thing, the cats are causing her health issues. We had to take action. After searching long, and hard it was overwhelming initially. Not many people want to take in an elderly cat. My mom was nice enough to offer to take her in. I insisted that only if she really wants to, and she was happy to. She had an attachment to the cat as well, the cat has been in the family for a very long time.  Now i frequently visit my cat, change her litter box, and feed her. She seems just as happy, shes around familiar faces. My mom already had a dog, with whom my cat was used to and gets along with as well. All in all, revisiting this, is less stressful than before.

It starts with a husband who made it terrible mistake by having an affair. It's about a wife who found out and obviously was devastated. Unfortunately it's the kids who suffer the most, as they have to deal what's the consequences that are outside of their control. This is about a husband who has sought counseling, has apologized constantly and has tried to show that he has changed. This is also about a wife who cannot bring herself to forgive. So then what happens to the family? The wife states that she is going to divorce him, yet can't bring herself to actually do it. You have a husband who is stuck in no man's land. The husband will not file for divorce. Which puts the family in a trap that no one can seem to get out of. The parents are separated, the family is separated, do they still do things together. No one can seem to move forwards together or a part. It is a family in crisis, that they can't seem to get out of. So where does this family go from here? And how can this family move on, when 1 person wants nothing but reconciliation and the other person can't make up their mind.

This trip was meant to celebrate the 4th of July. They had a very large house and we played a lot of games and it was a fun time. We spent a lot of time in the yard playing. After that we had a big family dinner with all of family. After that we all went to bed. In the morning we had a large breakfast. After that we played for a little while longer and then said good byes. Overall I think the trip was a very fun time. I got more of a chance to play outside than I normally do. We had all different kinds of games and it felt like there was a never ending list of things to do. It's always very fun to be able to catch up with them. I don't get to see this part of my family very often so it was a very fond memory and I was surprised how much everyone had grown. I really enjoy being out there because there is house is further away from the city than mine is. I always enjoy going out there because my aunt is a very good cook. I hope I can start taking these trips more regularly.,3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX95151KA,,0.0

During the ceremony, my son, who has autism, was being happy, making noise, being loud, but he also wanted to get down. My husband had him at the time. He happened to be sitting right behind the groom's father and step mother. My husband was trying to keep him entertained and get him to be quiet, but he's little so he didn't understand. The father and his wife kept giving side eye glances to my husband and son because they were annoyed. I tried to avoid the camera and go around to get my son because they were getting upset that they couldn't hear. I took my son to the back of the ceremony area where he couldn't annoy them anymore. He kept making noise and wanted to run around because he just didn't understand. I ended up missing a lot of the ceremony because I was busy entertaining my son and making sure he didn't run into the ceremony where they were filming. I guess I was surprised that someone could get that upset about a little boy making noise. He wasn't even crying, he was just having a good time. I was hurt that they could treat my son that way and that someone thought of him as an annoyance. I just felt bad for my child.",3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6K572CI,,0.0

We do not get to see these friends very much because they moved to Riverside a couple years ago.  It was great to be able to spend a three day weekend with them. I do miss them a lot. My kid really misses one of her best friends, their daughter.  We drove up to Perris Lake from where we live in Southern California. Let me remind you that was one of the hottest weekends there this summer.  I think the wind was the only thing that saved us from getting too hot.  It was nice to set up our tent, enjoy the lake, and enjoy a good campfire for a couple of nights. On our last night there on Sunday, there was a magical thunderstorm.  I say magical because you do not see many of them in that area of California.  We got a great lighting show, We got lucky with the rain not actually hitting us. I did stay up most of the night watching this with my husband and one of our friends.   We got to let the kids and us grown-ups enjoy the lake everyday. We got have to make great meals everyday.  We made a campfire every night and made Smores one of those nights.  I think I just enjoyed kicking back and relaxing before life got crazy with school starting that Tuesday.  I was happy that we made so many memories with this camping trip. It was a great ending to the summer.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZWXMNJO,,0.0

Although my leg is still a bit stiff, the physical therapy sessions have helped. Since my injury, I've been a little too careful with my activity. That's lead to some atrophy in the muscle in my leg. I have been trying to do lower body exorcises and be more active in general.  The psychological aspect of a bone breaking has been the hardest to overcome. Will I break the leg again because it is weak?  Do I always have to be ""on guard"" and careful? I guess time will help with that. The insurance payments for the injury have been ridiculous. I receive large bills from the medical providers. I call my insurance company and they tell me that they will pay the bill, just be patient. This continues for months. Finally, after months, the insurance company pays up. I guess the game here is to hope that the insured will pay some or all of the bills just to see the paper onslaught stop.

Before they came down, we settled on visiting Zion National Park as part of a graduation trip. My parents rented a car, and drove out from California to Utah. When we arrived into town, we checked into a hotel located on the river. The hotel was next to a bus system that could take us into town, and then into the national park. The bus was helpful, since the weather was overcast and rainy. Due to the rain, we had less of a selection of trails, but we still made the most of the trip. After we unpacked all of our things, we went into town to shop and explore the area. We ate at one of the restaurants, got a trail guide, and explored a few of the shops. The next day we took the bus to the trails at Zion National park. We hiked along beautiful trails with waterfalls, plant life, and animals. My favorite trails went right up to the waterfalls. We also visited the nature center, and learned about the wildlife and history of the park. After hiking, we went back into town and relaxed. We brought snacks back to our room and talked about our day.",3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFGL9IX2A,,0.0

A few months back my favorite cousin was sent back to jail. Sadly he tested dirty we went to his parole officer. What made matters worse was that his home was swatted and they found quite a bit of different drugs there as well. I live in a small town so of course this was in newspaper and featured the sheriff County's facebook page. There were a lot of negative comments stating that he was a horrible person and deserves jail time you name it they were saying it. But I know I love my cousin and things are just so black and white, if people kept open mind even know that he had a very rough child without a father and he got with the wrong crowd. When he got married 5 years ago he was clean and doing so well but there was a fire at his home and he had to jump out of a second-story when after saving his kids and wife. Because of this he hurt his back and got addicted to painkillers. And he started to smoke weed and two other drugs to take away his pain and progressing depression. I suppose if I didn't know the specifics behind it it would see my cousin. As a good or bad person (ie) a black or white mentality of his character. But most things in this life there's always two sides to every story which gives way to gray areas of life. I just wish more people saw the world this way.

Multiple of them thanked me for the experience. Again, it made me feel like I was in the right career. I had been having doubts previously about whether to continue in my teaching program. This experience helped me to realize that I was doing the right this. I comparison, the classes that I am TAing for now are not as good. I think the students appreciate me but I will maybe not get that level of feedback. I was actually told by the administrative error that the school never conducted teaching evalutions for those sections, so I never even got full feedback.

She has dementia, and it wasn't until early November of 2018 that I was informed about how bad it was really getting. During most of 2018, I wrestled with Medicaid to try and get her the help she so desperately needed. First, I had to try and find her paperwork, which was very hard as with dementia she didn't keep things. Then, her application was denied because she made $200 too much. After retracing my steps and talking with some people in the main office for my state, I found out  about the waiver program and worked for four months with her social service rep. What made it especially hard was that I live over 200 miles away. I was very thankful that my aunt was nearby to help as much as she could. During this time, there were a lot of issues in that my mother still had her car and was forgetting how many glasses of wine she would drink at night. Finally, after so much work, we received the news in August that she was eligible and accepted into the Home and Community Based Services aging waiver. I remember nearly crying as I received the news from the social service rep. The program meant that she wouldn't have to drive anymore, and that she would have in-home aides and care (non-skilled) for as long as she was able to remain at home safely. Even though it is still incredibly tough, emotionally and logistically, we now have someone there are least 6 hours every day to keep an eye on her and make things so much easier on both me and my aunt. We no longer struggle alone, and my mother now has the care she deserves. The struggle will not end, but we have a service coordinator who is incredibly sweet. He is attentive to our needs and tries to navigate the ever-changing system for us. My mother is getting worse, but she is also much calmer than she was before and I will never forget the day that I finally had some relief in the news that someone knew we needed help and was able to help us.",3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYUCGWFA,,0.0

We went to a secluded creak that has a clearing to swim in. It was with a group of friends from a spiritual community that I am a part of. When went after the Sunday service and it was a small group of about 7 people. We drove in two separate cars and the drive was about 10 minutes to get to where we were going. I had some memories come up while we were there from when I was a kid and I used to go swimming with my family and groups of friends at places like these. I also felt myself withdrawing from the group a bit and not relating well. I cut my leg on a rock when I was going into the water. It made me start to obsessively worry about if it would be infected and also being mad at myself for being reckless. The water felt good in the hot weather and I got some good exercise while swimming. I put on a lot of sunscreen so I didn't get sunburned. We stayed at the place swimming and talking for about 2 hours. Then we drove back to our community and had some food and drinks. I found myself regretting not trying to connect with people more. I noticed how I was doing things to make myself feel alienated and separate from the people I was with.,3137ONMDKHRBK2LKPMN778OAFZ3EGI,,0.0

I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me.

I took acid and we were going to go to a museum, something we'd done before and I loved. Once we were outside he was clearly mad and started going off on me, yelling at me in the street. I was starting to peak and all I could see was the absurdity in this. Why was he so mad? What did this matter? I don't even remember what pissed him off, it was so stupid. I couldn't help it, I laughed. That made him furious and he grabbed me by the wrist and dragged me back to the car. I could think of nothing worse than an hour drive home with him yelling at me, then being trapped in an apartment in the suburbs with no where to go and him yelling at me. I shook free and said I wouldnt be going. He said he was going to force me, and I pointed out how bad that would look for him. So he left me in the city. I watched his snapchat location, while he texted me things about how horrible I was, and saw him drive off, leaving me alone in a low cut dress.

I still can't think about the incident for too long without getting overcome with emotion. He had been complaining about chest pain and headaches for days. Honestly, we ignored him because he is very dramatic and he complains about nothing all the time. Finally, he knew something was wrong and took himself to the emergency room. We found out the next day that he had suffered a heart attack sometime in the days prior to his hospitalization. Even worse, after performing some tests, it was determined that he would need surgery. He needed emergency bypass surgery in order to open up the passageways to his heart. In total he would need 5 bypasses to be performed. The surgeon was very direct and blunt with his feelings on the matter, it was likely there would be serious complications. My dad has been a heavy smoker for my over 50 years. The surgeon feared that his lungs wouldn't be able to withstand the trauma that is involved with a surgery as big as a bypass surgery. The day of the surgery my mother and brother and I gathered in the waiting room and stared at the television in the distance. For hours we sat like that, waiting to hear something about my Dad. Finally the surgeon emerged from one of those big locked doors. He looked so serious, I remember thinking he was coming to tell us my Dad had died. For those 3 seconds that it took him to finish walking to us I lived in a world where my Dad had died, I will never forget that feeling. I was wrong, though, he survived the surgery. He was in recovery and although it would be a few days before my Dad was able to be taken off a breathing machine, he would make a complete recovery.",3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIJJ7BKI,,0.0

It was an exciting experience that I will always remember. I sang 4 song to a crowd of about 200. When I first stepped on stage I was sweating profusely. My teacher( who was playing the piano) smiled at me and reassured me that it would be fine. I started singing an impossible dream and the crowed was stunned at the was I sang the song. I was quite surprised myself. When I sing I take the song into myself and make it a part of me. When I was done singing there were people in the audience who openly wept. My teacher was crying and I found I was crying myself. It took me awhile to regain my composure, but when I did I was in the middle of a standing ovation. I sang many more song that day, but the memory of my first one will always be the best. This will always be my best memory because of the joy I felt at not only being the center of attention but the star of the show. I wonder if people who sing professionally feel like this every time they step on stage. I guess I will find out soon since because of that recital I have had interviews with several opera houses.",,,0.0

As I was laying in bed, I got a random message on Facebook Messenger. When I opened the message, I noticed it was from somebody that I didn’t even know. The messages were very rude and racist threatening to kill me and my family. A few years before that, my dad was involved in a shooting (he is a police officer). The person that was messaging me was claiming to be the girlfriend of the guy that my father had shot and killed 3 years previously. I then proceeded to send a text message to my dad to ask him advice on what I should do. He advised me that I should call the police and put in a report. The police ended up showing up and  I put in a report, then we determined that the profile was a fake profile. I decided to do some investigating on my own and messaged a few people to see if they knew who owned the fake profile. Eventually, one of my friends confirmed that the owner of the profile was an old friend of ours. Then I called the police back up to give them the new information. A few days later, the kid that was sending me the threatening/racist messages was arrested on a domestic violence charge involving is father and ended up admitting to sending me the messages when questioned about it. He ended up getting my charge dropped, but he is currently in prison for probation violation on a robbery charge. This situation has stuck with me for the last few months and I think about it every day. The part that stuck with me the most is that he threatened to kill my 1 year old child.",,,0.0

After a few more people showed up he let us in.  The room was huge and had about 200 people laying down on the ground.  The stage was set with crystal bowls and people dressed in some sort of wizardly outfits.  It was vaguely spooky to be there.  The sounds were amazing and so interesting, I've never heard anything like that before in person.  After what seemed like 2 minutes we got up and it was over.

I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life. I imagine the closer you are to the person who dies the more off balance your life becomes.",,,0.0

My friend managed to get tickets for the show from another friend of his who was not able to go. I was the first person he thought of to invite to the concert, which I thought was very nice and sweet of him. The show was amazing, and it a great bonding experience for me and my friend. I felt much closer to him afterwards. It was a very positive emotional experience for me, because I got to experience it with a close friend and because I'm very passionate about music. Both of the bands put on a stellar show. The concert was about 3 hours long all together and we went out to eat afterwards. Overall, it was a great night.

He was 70 years old.  He was diagnosed with lung cancer only seven months ago.  His first symptoms were difficulties in memory and reading.  An MRI showed a tumor in his brain.  Further investigation revealed that the cancer had originated in his lungs.  My dad and I were extremely close, and this news affected me deeply.  We were both shocked by it all, and both had trouble coming to grips with it.  I spent just about every day with him after work, helping him get to appointments and running errands for him.  When it became clear that he was terminal, him and I spent the rest of his day settling his affairs and preparing for the end.  Looking back on what happened, what really sticks out the most was how quickly everything had happened.  Before his diagnosis, Dad was in excellent health.  To see him go from that to death in 7 months will always be a shock to me.  It gave me my first real brush with mortality.  I have, since then, given maybe too much thought to the impermanence of life.",,,0.0

We both had obligations to fill, and our schedules were packed to the gills with various work. This led to us both feeling rather stressed. So when we did have some time, we went all out. My wife had never seen Disney world before. Originally hailing from China, she would hear stories about this magical place. She never would have thought she'd have the chance to visit. So we took the first jet from NYC to Orlando and went to the magic kingdom. All of the parks - Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom. She enjoyed every minute of the rides and the masterful design of the parks. I would say her favorite park was animal kingdom, particularly for the amount of birds we saw. We spent about a week in Orlando, visiting other sites, such as Universal Studios. However, the main attraction for her was Disney. We came home and resolved to spend more time together, and now we try to do something fun and unique at least once a month. As a result, we feel much happier and fulfilled.",,,0.0

It was a special event for me as I haven't seen them in about 10 years. For the exception of my mother and my younger brother all of my relatives live in Cuba. I had been planning and was very interested in going to see my family for many years, but was unable to because of lack of money mostly because for most of those years I was underage and wasn't able to raise enough money. After raising enough money for my visa and the plane ticket along with all other necessary expenses I would be having on this trip I decided it was time to finally go on this long awaited trip. I booked my flight, told my younger brother about the trip but decided not to tell anyone else as I wanted to surprise them. On the day of the flight I took an Uber to the airport as the only person that new was my underage brother and therefore I had no one that could of drove me there. In the airport things were pretty simple I just checked in and since I just have a small luggage I didn't have to make any long lines in order to check in additional bags. The flight went smoothly as well and about an hour I was in the capital of Cuba. Once I got there I immediately went to the arrival line where a lady asked me some questions and after a short interview I was able to get my bag and check out. Once I walk out the airport doors It honestly felt like I was transported 50 years back. All the cars and structures seemed like they were all from the 70's or older for the exception of tourist rental cars and the occasional modern Kia like small car. Thankfully I was fluent in the language and remembered by previews trips to Cuba as a kid and was able to find a person that guided me to a place in the city where I could rent a car for my week long stay. I drove directly to where my family lived about 3 hours away from the capital with no directions as I remembered how to get there. Seen my family once again was an awesome experience and brought back many memories from my childhood trips. The week went by faster that expected but I was able to see my siblings in the island as well as the rest of my family from both my moms and dads side, as well as experienced a whole other culture. Undeniably, it was a very emotional trip and one I would love to experience again in the near future but next time I'll be taking my younger sibling so he can also experience it.",,,0.0

As it is usually just my son and I home we have things down to a 't' when it comes to our schedule but his grandma was home which messed things up a bit. Not only for him but for me too. She's a lot harder to entertain versus a 10 month old. But I had let her take him in with her and she was making her bed. This bed is a good 4 feet off the ground mind you. She decided to put him on top of it and when she was on the other side my poor baby had fallen off. So of course I rush in with my heart beating out of my chest because he was crying so bad. She was trying to explain but I didn't want to hear none of it, I just wanted my baby to be okay. I eventually got him calm and he went to sleep but when he woke and started back in on crying again I knew something wasn't right. I was so angry at her for hurting him though she didn't intentionally hurt him. I still blamed her because I thought how could you not be more careful? You know your bed is a mountain compared to this baby, you know he moves fast! How, how, how did you not think that this would have happened before it did. So we took him to the doctors and this poor little 10 month old is already in to get x-rays. I was devastated, embarrassed and so, so sorry for my little guy. Turns out he got a small fracture to the wrist. So they put a cast on him for 3 weeks and they said the bone will be stronger than it was before since he is so young. It was reassuring but it sure didn't make me feel any better about the situation. Yeah, last week sucked.",,,0.0

But i was also glad i got to tell her how much i loved her days before she passed. After her funeral we all celebrated and all of us had amazing stories to tell about our amazing loving grandmother. Her side of the family that was still alive came, also my grandfathers side of the family came. All her friends and all the people she has helped over the years also attendant. She also planned weeks before she passed away. Her and my grandfather had a talk and she also wrote letters to each and everyone of us along with a video. She had also planned her whole funeral and i thought that was amazing. The funeral that she planned for her self was great and hope i could do that when its time for me to go. We all celebrated the whole day. People that we haven't seen in years came and i felt like that brought us a bit closer. Ever since that has happened we plan family Friday  twice a month, we all get together and just have fun. One of the moment of that day i will never forget was when it was time to bury her,  when it was time to go down it started to rain so hard out of no where and it stopped when she was finally cover.

She was a new patient and I had never met her. The guy I was dating also worked with me as a therapist. Halfway into my session with this new girl, she tells me she is dating the guy I have been dating. I internally panicked and had a very physical reaction. I was shaking and getting red in the face which I am sure she noticed. I do not know how I held it together so well but I completed the assessment before I allowed myself to feel and think about what had just happened. I was so angry and hurt. I felt used and lied to. I immediately texted him angry things. He had seen she was on my schedule earlier in the morning and I do not know what he didn't say anything to me. Of course I asked him why this happened and how he couldn't have told me. He told me that he broke up with her immediately after session and that they didn't talk about the session which I know is a complete lie. I have tried not to drive myself crazy about thinking of why. It was a very painful event to me both personally and professionally. I felt shaken up by this event which led me to a spiral in my role as a therapist. I was afraid of session and so anxious afterwards.",,,0.0

It was memorable because there were alot of people there and we had a great time.  We started with a short outdoor service and then had a time back inside.  Before everyone else got there, there was a cocktail hour with wine and some snacks.  It was alot of fun.  The air was hot outside though, so we were glad went the service was over and we could go inside to the ac.  We were sweating alot.  They had italian food for the dinner.  And even more importantly, they had drinks upstairs at the open bar.  The bar had a few options for mixed drinks. My favorite was a drink with rum and cherries.  It was red. Then we at the italian food for dinner and had some cake.  The cake was white wedding cake and very good.  There were more drinks and even some dancing.  To take a break from dancing we went outside to get air.  But it was still hot outside, so we walked around the garden only for a little bit.  THen we came back inside.  We danced for about 2 more hours before it was time to go. Overall, it was a great evening and the couple seemed pretty happy. What made it so memorable was the good friends that all came together. I was most surprised that the bride and groom bought a open bar for the occasion cause those are expensive.",,,0.0

My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be. It was a rough couple of weeks but I'm glad we could get justice for Eric.",,,0.0

I was told that I was going to be promoted to a much higher position in the company. This job would come with a huge pay increase and I would now be in charge of a team of people. It would also come with added responsibilities but I was fine with that. I was extremely happy and felt very proud of myself for finally achieving the job that I wanted.

I am worn out though and will enjoy the break. Now I can focus on my tasks that have fallen a bit behind. Maybe I will start a new project.

My now husband has the ability to surprise me when I least expect it.  He proposed on the balcony of our backyard over the ocean looking at the sunset.  We have been renovating his house for quite a few years so it was a special time for him to propose.  We had actually been broken up for several weeks and we were just starting to talk again.   I wasn't expecting us to do much for my birthday, but when I got there after he asked me to dinner he took me up to the balcony and proposed.  After we engaged we decided that we want to get married in Washington DC. This was a special place for us since we had visited there the previous year.  We instilled in the services of an elopement company to help us with our wedding.  We decided not to take any of our family and elope.  They weren't too happy with us, but we wanted to get married (it was the second for him and third for me) so it was more special for it to just be us.  We got married at the DC War Memorial in Washington DC right behind the Washington Monument and next to the WWII Memorial.  It was a gorgeous venue. The government was shut down so we had the opportunity to get married at a monument without a lot of people around, which was amazing.  Our pictures were gorgeous.  It was snowing and it was freezing, but it made for such a memorable event.  I was super excited to be his wife.",,,0.0

I finished the beat and it turned out to be my best beat I've ever made. I mixed and mastered the beat and then recorded my vocals. It turned out great and was definitely my best song I made yet. I uploaded it to my YouTube page which I had built up to a decent subscriber count. Within 24 hours, my song had amassed over ten thousand views. I was astounded. I couldn't believe my music had resonated with this many people this quickly. I felt deeply touched by the fact that my dreams were coming true before my very eyes. This experience motivated me to make even better music. It also showed me that I am more than capable of making it big as an artist.

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.",,,0.0

In most cultures, birthdays are celebrated in some of the same ways. Often, birthdays are celebrated with a gift, party, or some other special act. main event this Falling in love with the person that is your perfect fit is one of the best feelings in the world. Although it's not uncommon to find yourself falling in love (or simply, lust) with the wrong person before getting to Mr. Right, when you finally meet the guy for you, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Everything you thought you knew about love and relationships will suddenly be turned on its head. And it's not just love you'll feel - you'll go through a whole host of other positive emotions. Here are some of the things you can expect to feel when you start falling for the right someone. When I met my husband, the primary emotion I remember feeling was shock. It sounds nuts, but I truly couldn't believe he even existed. I had spent so much time before not even sure if I wanted to be in a relationship. I didn't really believe that true love was real, and I definitely didn't think I'd ever feel so strongly about someone that I wanted to be with forever. Falling in love with the right person will leave you feeling surprised, like you didn't see it coming. You'll marvel at the fact that someone so perfect for you even exists - let alone loves as much as they do, too. In prior relationships, I would purposely not express how I was feeling most of the time, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. It could be the biggest thing, like disappointment over a friend moving, to the smallest, like moodiness from PMS. It didn't matter - if it was a real feeling, I kept it to myself. With my husband, however, I want to do the exact opposite: share everything with him. When you're with the right someone, you'll know because you'll feel safer than you ever have in the past. In relationships before my husband, I knew what it was like to feel momentarily excited (or even happy) for a little bit.",,,0.0

I've been out of the game for about 3 months now, and while I would never consider going back to it, I do like to reflect every now and then. It all started with a girl I had met in college. A woman, really. She was about 5 years older than me at the time, I 19, she 24. Before I had met her I had no interest in doing any kind of drugs. I was going to school for criminal justice and felt I could have a good future as a police officer. That dream ended when I started smoking. I just wanted her to think that I was cool (spoiler alert, she did not).I hadn't grown up doing a lot of bad things. I hadn't grown up being afraid or wary of the police. So when I drove into a motel parking lot to spark up a bowl (only about a block away from my residence, I had lived with my parents at the time, who were not cool with the MJ). When a cop pulled up to me with his lights on mid bowl hit, I was petrified. The only time I had been stopped by police was for a traffic ticket. Lo and behold, 2 random pills that I had never seen before or heard of in my life materialized in my center console, and I was taken in for possession of a controlled substance. I started selling marijuana to various peoples to pay off my gigantic attorney fee. Fast forward a little bit and I get arrested, again, for having an ounce of weed on me.

The news was grim as doctors told my extended family members that her organs were failing. I immediately got off the phone and started to look at flights with my husband. Money is tight in our house as my husband is the only one bringing income into our home but we bought a plane ticket to Phoenix so I could see her once last time and say my goodbyes. I reflected and remembered so many wonderful times with my grandmother while I was flying from Atlanta to Phoenix. I was expecting the worst when I got off the flight but in fact my grandmother held on while I was in the air. I met up at the hospital with my parents and my grandmothers organs were back to almost fully functioning. We were able to chat, laugh and remember so many wonderful memories with her as she was awake and coherent. I spent four amazing days with my grandmother in the hospital before having to head back home. I was so touched by how my father helped her in and out of her bed and how he held her hand the entire time we were with her. It was truly so sweet and genuine. With such a grim diagnosis in the middle of July, my grandmother held on for another week and a half before peacefully leaving this earth surrounded by family. I find great comfort knowing that I was able to see her and talk with her. I also feel so at peace that she wasn't in any pain when she passed away. I hope that I can live such a long and healthy life as she did.",,,0.0

I remember vividly getting my diagnosis & just breaking down. I was diagnosed with not only Crohn's Disease, but also Ulcerative Colitis. From January of 2015 to now, I'm still suffering. 27 feet of intestines removed and over 20 surgeries later. Not to mention during this 13 hour surgery my lungs failed. I was put into ICU on a breathing machine. The impact this made on my life was dramatic. From having my intestines hanging out of my stomach. To feeling the absolute worst pain you can imagine and waking up not knowing whats going on. Overall it was a tough time, but I learned a lot! Looking back it was definitely something I could never forget. Most important it made me into the man I am today. Tomorrow is never promised and you just have to have faith.",,,0.0

We prepared for the graduation for almost a month. The graduation day served as a reunion for a lot of people. Since he grew up in Washington, a lot of friends were able to attend the ceremony. This was to my delight. I was also surprised at how far he has come in life. I know that I have been with him all the way, but this was still surprising ( similar to how surprising it is for parents as they watch their children grow). The day of the ceremony was pure delight. I was introduced to some of his college friends which was a bit shocking to me as he has always had a private and compartmentalized life. I also talked to his girlfriend, whom I had never met. It is necessary to understand why I was so happy. My son was depressed in high school, and had attempted to commit suicide. Seeing him graduate college was overwhelming and crazy for me. Seeing him overcome obstacles made be the happiest person on earth that day.",,,0.0

My stomach immediately dropped. I didn't hear what he said directly afterwards because worry consumed me and I started thinking of all of the things that would be effected. Once I could focus again I asked him if he was serious. He explained that he did lose his job with the company he has worked for for the last 19 years, but that he was being hired by the company they were changing their name to. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, be happy or mad. He also told me that with the name change, he was going to receive a 15% raise. My mind again filled with different scenarios, but much more pleasant ones. I had been worried about budgeting for braces and this was an answer to my prayers. This would cover our daughter's braces and then some. The amount of stress that would be lifted would make a difference in everyday life. It will change our life, not dramatically, but significantly. What started as a horrible call ended up being a great call that allowed me to relax like I haven't in a long time. I know that everything is going to work out and be okay. I'm still a little irritated at my husband for doing that to me, but all in good fun, I guess.",,,0.0

We had managed to do quality work despite the shortage of people. After finishing the parking, we noticed a problem in certain sections of the parking lot.

The were dressed nicely, and solemnly walked down the aisle to the front, asked everyone to rise, and apologized to us, and said they had found God. He wanted to go from pew to pew to sahek everyone in the church's hand. A very nice gesture. Along with it, they said sorry to all of us.

We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her. I approached it like how my counselor told me to, and she said I have to realize that it may not go the way it is intended to, and she was right, and that is why it hurt all the more.",,,0.0

The Dr. told her that she was dilated to a 5 and that she should probably stay there in the hospital, but she was far to stubborn for that, after that this was our 4th kid. After we left the hospital she said that if she was gonna have a baby today that wasn't going to do it on an empty stomach. So we went in town to get some food. She ate everything on the menu it seemed. I think she got 4-5 different dishes, it was funny. After eating we went ahead and drove the 45 mins home. We sat around and watch TV and did some other things the rest of the day, then we put the other kids to bed and went to bed ourselves. Ate 3am she wakes me up and say Shes having hard contractions. I wake up and ask her how hard to realize that she cant even move and that they are back to back... awesome. I call her mom and tell her to come over and sit at our house while our kids slept so we could go to the hospital. I get dressed and try to get her outside to my truck, she cant get off the ground to get in while having contractions so i literally picked her up and threw her in. Her mom still wasn't there, I called her and for the first time in my life told her to do something ""you need to get here, we gotta go"" I said. We went ahead and left our kids at home since she was only a minute away and I drove as fast as my truck has ever driven. There I was driving 100+ in an 8200lb truck down the interstate nervous as she kept having contractions in my truck turned around bent over holding the back of the seat. it was nuts. Then I looked down and noticed I was on E. Oh shit. This thing better make it in. We finally made it, I had driven a 45 min drive in 20 mins, new record. We get inside, 10 mins later we have a new baby. What a day that was. It was so close to disaster the whole time. I was spent, and we both went slept great that night, even the new baby slept awesome.",,,0.0

He gave me directions. the he did something unexpected. Cops dot do that. He told me how to get there, he told me that the game would start a little later because they knew about teh detour. He also pointed to some other pedestrians who were walking. He motioned them to come over. He told them that I was going to the game too.  I thanked him so mnay times that he started giggling. and blushing. I walked to the stadium with my new found guides and was teher before long.  Then my friends found me.

I should start with some backstory. I met my girlfriend in 2017, we had some mutual friends and became friends through them. We instantly hit it off and started a great friendship. That quickly evolved into a romantic relationship within about a month and we began dating in August of 2017. We have had a pretty incredible relationship, obviously not perfect but we always come out of situations on top, together. I knew that I wanted to marry her pretty early into our relationship, but I also knew it was something that I didn't want to rush into. She didn't want to rush into it either. We very much wanted to take our time getting to know one another and just enjoying our lives together. Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to propose on our two year anniversary, and I started getting things set up to do so. I picked out the ring with the help of her sister, who is her best friend, and got on with planning the proposal. I decided the most important place to us would be the perfect place to propose, and that's at a local park where we shared our first kiss. In order to ensure that she didn't suspect anything, I had her sister suggest to her that we go on a double picnic date in that park with her and her husband before we went for our anniversary dinner alone later that night. We would then take some photos together as a group and just the two of us. Since she believed it was her sister's idea, my girlfriend suspected absolutely nothing. When it came time, my girlfriend's sister suggested that my girlfriend and I pose for a couples photo, and as we were stood next to each other, I stepped back, got down on one knee and proposed. She was shocked and overjoyed, and after realizing what was happening, jumped into my arms and said yes. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, knowing that I will be spending the rest of my life with this woman. I know our wedding day will top this, but it was such an amazing day that we will never forget.",,,0.0

Unfortunately, the Board decided to hire a extremely under qualified part time staff member. He was hired because he is friends with the board chair. This has been especially concerning since I have been at this job for over 15 years. This has me thinking that our board is actually not very fair and doesn't actually uphold the ideals of the organization. I am now thinking of changing jobs. the problem is I am good at my job. I also Like my Job. It is disappointing to have to look for another job due to cronyism. The organization I work for is suppose to be trustworthy. I guess I was wrong.

He started to really develop deep feelings for me, feelings that I did not return in kind. I still continued to date him for a time just to hang out as friends, but then about six months ago I broke up with him as a romantic dating partner to move on with someone else. He was very confused and hurt by this event, and accused me of leading him on and giving him false encouragement, so I ended out friendship and I cut off all contact with him. I felt very guilty for presuming to continue to spend time with someone that I knew I felt zero chemistry with just to have a friend to spend time with. I regretted having to be so abrupt and cold when I broke up with this person, too. I wish there would have been a way to remain friends, because he was a nice person and I enjoyed his company on a friendship level. I was resigned to the fact that this would not be possible after the way things happened and evolved with the break up, though. At first I felt bad for being unable to conjure up feelings that just weren't there for him and for hurting his feelings, but eventually I began to see things in a slightly different way. I think it is quite common for people to have a variety of dating experiences that aren't ideal in some form or other while they're out there searching for people they want to be with romantically. There are never any guarantees or promises in romantic situations in the early stages, before there is any kind of commitment made and while feelings are still developing or unclear. Even if I am not the best judge of chemistry, it is not wrong to end a relationship with someone you don't feel a romantic attraction to. I feel that trying to compromise or settle in dating relationships will cause everyone involved to have unnecessary pain and heartache in the end. So I was sorry for hurting anyone's feelings, but I do not regret doing what I did in the end. I did not wrong anyone by dating them and giving them a fair chance, and by being their friend, simply because I didn't ultimately develop romantic feelings for them in the end.",,,0.0

I bought my condo last year and the courtyard was one thing I had always wanted and had based my purchase on it. I've taken horticulture in college so I'm pretty knowledgeable about how to do it. About 4 years before I purchased the condo, previous owners had hired a landscape company to decorate it with a flowering tree, plants, pond and black river rock stone as mulch. They sold the condo to a retired woman a year later and she never even pulled one weed. So when I bought it, it was an overgrown jungle. My first step was pulling out weeds and dead bushes. My next step, which took about 3 months, was pulling out all the river rock from about 1 foot down in the dirt. From rain and other weather, the rocks had sunken down through the landscape fabric and underneath all the weeds. Every day, I spent 15-30 minutes overturning the dirt, one shovel scoop at a time, then pulling each rock out (from 1 in. to 4 inches wide) and tossing them into huge plastic bins in the garage. I then drew out a new landscape plan, bought the plants, dug the holes and planted them. To my surprise, I called a pond company and I was able to afford their services of rebuilding my broken down pond and adding a filter, pump and some underwater plants. After that was all done, I called a landscape company to drag the bins out of the garage, lay down new landscape fabric and all those black rocks. I also brought out my garden decor, added fish to the pond, added some smaller plants to decorative pots and finally stood back to look at my work. I can't believe how beautiful it is and my neighbors also love it. It's a soothing place to come out to several times a day for relaxation.",,,0.0

I was in the car with him and I was driving and this black male came running at my car on the passenger side with a gun at a stoplight. The windows were down and he stuck the gun in the car and told us to get out. My boyfriend Hunter said no and he stuck the gun in his face so he grabbed it and pulled down and got shot in the foot. I know this didn't happen exactly to me, but it has made a huge impact in my life. I have PTSD and I don't even feel comfortable being in the car that it happened in. My ears ring to this day and every loud noise freaks me out. I am still continuing to figure out parenting on my own while he's recovering. I never got to mentally heal or physically heal since it happened two weeks after I gave birth. Not having my boyfriend at home was really tough because I had to do all the feedings all the diaper changes, figure out a schedule and do all these things on my own while he was at the hospital. Now that he's home, my source of income is mTurk and it's stressful trying to do everything I can and still not make enough money to support a family of three. My boyfriend can't pick up my son without being in pain and it hurts me to see. Every time I close my eyes I can see the look on his face when the bullet hit him. The bullet was a hollow point and destroyed his foot. I suddenly had to become a nurse and get taught how to give him injections for the pain medication and learn how to change out his IV bag at home and change the dressings on his foot until it closed up. Being a young mother and now becoming a caregiver as well drains me. I am very depressed, very anxious, and losing hope. I don't sleep because I'm terrified that my boyfriend will stop breathing because he's in so much pain. And on top of that, being paranoid about my newborn son stop breathing in his sleep.",,,0.0

I was so devastated knowing that I would never see her again. That day, I went out for a walk because I couldn't stand staying at home.

I cleaned her up and fed her. She was so well behaved, I thought she was someones pet. Because I just lost my dog that day, I was very scared that I would lose this kitten too.

It was pretty funny actually, they like expected me to be sad or something. The HR guy was on the line through a remote location. They basically just sat me down and said I didn't clean the hood. I told them that yes I did, and told them they should look to whatever day I cleaned the bins. Then I asked when they were asking people if I cleaned if they asked my other coworker. They said they had not. When I asked to review the tapes myself, the tapes didn't exist anymore. Like seriously how sketchy is that lol. I was so mad just about that really. Also they noted the hood was dirty 22 days after I supposedly cleaned it. They addressed it to me almost 45 days after I cleaned it. And by the time they were firing me over it, the tape didn't exist. what a bunch of malarkey, really.",,,0.0

We went for a trip to the beautiful hill station last month. It was a nice family trip where we enjoyed a lot. The trip started on a breezy Sunday morning. We hired a van from our home and my uncle’s family accompanied us. We boarded a lodge at 10 ‘o clock in the morning and the weather so cold that we were freezing like a statue. After getting ready with all our jackets over us we went to the Thunder world which was a very different theme zone I have ever seen.  The botanical garden and rose garden were so amazing. It was a great scene to see so many flowers all together. They all looked as if they were smiling at us. The next day we visited Pykara and the boating experience there, was indeed not equivalent to words. The same afternoon we went to Mudhumalai forests and saw wildlife face to face. The trip was so wonderful that it cannot be explained simply in words. The trip to Ooty was definitely one of the most memorable ones in my life. Today my tenth board exam results have been declared. Until 2'o clock, my heart was beating very fast. As soon as I saw my result I felt that I was on the top of this world. I have come first in my school. Everyone was very happy after they came to know my results. My parents were so happy that they ordered lots of sweets and distributed in our neighborhood. I was at the top of the world after I came to know that I was the topper of my school. I will always remember this day as it was one of the best days of my life.  I was away on a long weekend with a group of my best friends, sitting around, drinking and having fun when something struck me. I wondered how this had happened? ​The most healthy person in the room had recently completed an Iron​ ​Man triathlon, so I had a pretty high benchmark to ​meet.  Fast forward a few years​ and ​I have completed 30+ marathons​ and ​ultra marathons and I think I did just fine.- Daniel Da Vinci   I was sitting in my room with some friends when I got a call from my dad's number.

We had been dating for three years and living together for one year.  I thought the time was right for us to take the next step in our relationship but didn't know how to go about it.  I thought about it for weeks on how to propose and more importantly where to propose.  The first time we met was at a park and I thought that would be a good place to ask her to marry me but I thought twice about it.  I then thought of the first date we had which was hiking at a local trail near our home.  Since we both love to hike I decided to propose to her while we were hiking but instead of doing it at our local trail I decided to go for a hike in Griffith Park.  In Griffith Park they have a great hiking trail on Mount Lee which leads you to the top of the Hollywood sign.  We got there really early in the morning and made our ascent up the mountain.  I didn't realize how long it was going to take.  After climbing for three hours we finally made it to the top completely exhausted.  Once we were there I got on my knees and asked her to marry me.  I could see the joy in her face as she said yes.  It was a great feeling something that I will never forget.  Knowing that I picked the right woman made it more special.  We both cried tears of joy and enjoyed the rest of the day celebrating our engagement!,,,0.0

I am very close to my sister even though we are six years apart and since the father of the baby is not in the picture, she asked me to be in the delivery room for support. Our parents live about nine hours away and they were planning to be at the birth, but she went into labor three weeks early. I was so touched by getting an opportunity to see a human life come into the world. My sister's ex fiance and father of the baby chose not to be a part of her pregnancy or the baby's life and that made me sad for her and my nephew. I feel a great responsibility to guide her with taking care of a child since I have two of my own children. The moment I got to hold my nephew was such a happy time. Looking at his innocent face, I wonder how his father could ever make the decision not to be a part of his life. I fully accept the responsibility of helping her raise this precious child. We have room in our basement for them to live when they leave the hospital. I felt good to know that I can provide them with shelter, food and love. I feel certain I can be a positive influence in this baby's life. I plan on encouraging my sister to finish getting her bachelor's degree and keep her motivated. I know she is upset that her baby will not have a father in his life, but if she sticks to her goals, I feel confident she will provide the best life for him. I am so grateful I could help her through this time and be a part of child's life.",,,0.0

We had been struggling to find a reason to continue our marriage; most of the spark had died out in our relationship and we were mostly coasting through our lives. We had reached a level of comfort that bred complacency, and each of us felt like we held the other back. When it happened, it was actually unexpected. We were going to a marriage counselor and getting nowhere. Our issues butted heads with each other and we were at an impasse, where we needed to let each other go in order to reach new ground. Neither of us wanted to be the person who made the first cut, so we tried everything we could to make it work. I really wanted to make it work. I loved being with her, we fit together so well and I'd never met anyone who meshed with me like she did. We went in to the marriage counselor and sat down on those stiff armchairs with scratchy pillows. Until now I felt as though our counselor was mediocre, that the discussion really led nowhere. The counselor looked at us both and asked what we wanted to do. I was confused and asked for clarification. She asked where there was to go from here, she wanted us both to ask ourselves that question, as to her eyes there was no direction and no progress happening. I stumbled through weak suggestions, each seeming more limp than the next. She swatted them away like flies and kept pressing us. I looked at my wife and back to the counselor, and I said that if these options were fruitless, the only other available option would be to break apart.

I was anticipating spending most of the proceeds from the sale of my older home on the fixups. The worst part was the carpeting. It was old, nasty brown and green shag. Horrible. Right after closing I went over to the house with my sisters and parents. I was feeling discouraged about all of the work left to do. I wanted to get started right away. My sister and I started ripping up a bit of the carpet. To my astonishment we found that under the living room carpet was unbelievably gorgeous hardwood flooring. It'd been perfectly preserved for over 40 years. The same was in the dining room, bedroom, and hallways. The discovery will save me thousands of dollars on renovation costs and free us up to tackle other projects. It's much nicer than what I could afford.

Our divorce was final in the early months of 2018. This was a very difficult time in my life, as we had been together for about nine years, she was a step mom to my two children, who adored her very much. My daughter, whose in her teens, had a very close relationship with her. I tried for months, to get her to work things out, but nothing that I tried or did, worked. I felt hopeless, utterly broken. I later found out, that the last year of our relationship she was seeing someone, and it further drove me into a downward spiral. But as they say, time heals all things. A few months ago, my ex reached out to me out of the blue. We had spoken before, briefly, but nothing of substance. Her texts through me for a loop, and for a moment, I felt like my prayers had been answered. She told me how she had missed me, my family, and thought about us a lot. After an exchange of texts for a few days, we met up, and it was the first time since our divorce, that I had seen her and it was like I was seeing her for the first time all over again. I told her how I felt about things, after finding everything out, how much it hurt, but also, that I still cared for her and there is nothing that could hold me back from wanting to give us another try. I thought things were looking up, I felt great. We went out on a few dates and things felt good. However, she was moving about an hour away, taking a new job and buying a house. I told her again, how I felt about her and she told me she wasn't in the same place. Ultimately, this hurt me quite a bit, and I felt like I was right back to where I was. Why did she text me to begin with? Did she want to know that I'd still be here? Things stopped after that, and we exchanged texts only occasionally, until she moved. I told her good luck with everything and to let me know if she ever needed anything. In those moments, I felt like we could be working towards something great, only to be left yet again, by the same person. Its been four months now and although I think about her from time to time, I believe things worked out for the best.",,,0.0

So later met a girl and he decided to stay over there in Europe.

Even though he is our second child, I felt many of the same emotions as when our older son was born almost five years ago. However, the circumstances were different enough that even though the experience overall was just as life-changing as I expected, it was more even in terms of emotional volatility. With our first son, we learned late in the process that he would have to be delivered early -- basically up to six weeks early, due to a spike in my wife's blood pressure. This made for a great deal of uncertainty. This time, we anticipated the baby to be induced early, and as such we were calmer throughout the process. Even so, the birthing process is a primal one, even for me, a spouse whose job is to provide support rather than actual physical labor. We went to the hospital at around 7 in the evening, expecting the process to take 24 hours or more as it had with our first child. Ultimately, however, our new baby was born healthy only about 12 hours later. There were some frustrating times during the labor. We did not have a proper ""labor bed"" because we had to switch rooms due to some non-functioning equipment in the initial room. The nurses did not notice this until my wife was about to deliver and it was too late to get a different bed. This made me slightly anxious, but I was calmed by the reassuring demeanor of the medical team. Prior to that, we managed to feel something -- anger -- that we had not expected. The doctors and nurses were very busy because of a full load of patients and multiple births happening at the same time. Because of that, the doctor who was supposed to come to our room to discuss pain relief options, including an epidural, arrived too late to have a meaningful impact on my wife's comfort level. In fact, his callous demeanor made us quite frustrated and upset. Ultimately, though, that faded into the background when our healthy baby boy was born.",,,0.0

My wife had planned a surprise party with my friends and family. I was caught off guard because my wife had told me that it was going to be a romantic dinner with just me and her. We had driven downtown and walked around going into different shops. We usually don't have this time together since we are parents to three kids. Once it was time for our reservation we went inside the restaurant. The manager told us our reservation had been taken by a more favored guest, but they did have a nice spot in the back of the restaurant. As we walk through the door; I see my parents, my wife's parents, my kids, and friends. It was a nice surprise party that made me feel special and caught off guard. My best friend handed me a drink and I greeted all of my guests. We sat down and there were five total courses from the chef. My friends and family each took time to talk to me and even roast me every so often. We stayed in the restaurant after it closed and soon left afterwards. It was a significant event in my life since I normally don't have birthday parties. It was also significant since it included the majority of my favorite people currently living. I felt grateful and appreciated the lengths my wife took to make the party happen without my knowledge. The most memorable moment for me was seeing everyone in the room for our dinner.",,,0.0

She called to tell me that they wouldn't give her the day off. I was really sad but I understood. At the last minute she called and said that someone worked a double shift so she would be able to come over for my birthday. They have been short staffed and the girl doing the schedule didn't ask my daughter if it was okay to put her on for the day she asked off. So her boyfriend worked and took another shift from someone that would come in and work for my daughter. I was really happy to find out she would be able to come because I only get to see her every couple of months. She came over and spent the whole day with me. She brought me breakfast and a new charm for my bracelet. We spent a relaxing day just hanging out. We went to Hobby Lobby and looked around but I couldn't find anything I liked. So we came home and had dinner. After dinner we had cake and it started to get dark. She headed home and text me when she made it.,,,0.0

On the 22nd I went to New York with my partner. They are going back to school at Cornell University and  I have been missing them dearly. But that is not all I have been pulled around by people who want to hire me to work for them, but end up telling me at the last minute that they are going with someone else. It happened with a job I was very excited about. I updated and designed my resume and cover letter for it and answered all of their questions and made it to the final round of the hiring process. They wanted to me to contact them after I talk to a seasonal job I was working at about whether they could accommodate me with having a full-time position as well. I did what they asked and contacted them only to wait two weeks to hear back and nothing. I had almost complete certainty that I had gotten the job so I had already out in my two weeks notice at one of the places I was working at. O guess I jumped the gun since after messaged the new job again did they finally get back to me saying that they were gonna go with other candidates. I was heart broken to be honest. I felt awful for a little bit. I felt like I was never gonna find the job of my dreams. I still kind of feel that way. But I can't let bad luck deter me from keep trying because if I am sad too long and accept what happens then maybe I could miss out on it.",,,0.0

I had steadily been losing weight for a year and I decided that I should start running again. It was only a 5K but it meant a lot to complete it. Consider that I was very obese a year ago and diabetic. Now my weight was 60 lbs. less. I felt great during training, well maybe not that great at first. But as time went on the feeling of accomplishment was wonderful. The day of the race was perfect. 55 degrees with low humidity. The crowd was larger than I expected. Must have been 5000 people lined up downtown for the beginning. Thankfully the race was chip timed because it took several minutes to get to the start line. I was considerate and lined up near the back because of course I would be in the slowest quartile. My time wasn't all that great but when you consider I am 70 years old, it becomes world class in my mind. My good friend Kay was there and she cheered me on. Drove me there too and of course took me home. We celebrated by going out to eat at a really nice resturaunt that night. Overall, the day was simply wonderful!",,,0.0

I have witnessed two seizures when he was with his mother, my daughter.  But I have never been his sole protector and advocate during one.  I have prayed that I would never see the day that I would be alone with him when one happened. But that day came. My husband and I went to their home to babysit so my daughter and son-in-law could go to an evening wedding of a friend.  As my grandson stood at the window waving goodbye to them, he turned slightly towards me and became rigid. I knew that he was about to go into a seizure. I laid him gently on the carpet and turned him onto his side. I told my husband to run outside and try to flag them down. I grabbed my cell phone to note what time the seizure began.  I made sure he was breathing. He jerked slightly for about a minute, and then his body relaxed and he gave a big sigh.  It was over. My husband had been able to stop them, and they all came in around that point. My grandson was very confused, and then became  sleepy, so my daughter held him for a long nap. I was very emotionally drained afterwards.  When someone has a seizure they are totally defenseless and helpless. My grandson's frailties and vulnerabilities was driven into me that evening.  It was a traumatizing event for me.   If someone near you has a seizure, you must act to help them. Get them safely to the ground, otherwise a fall could be very injurious or even fatal. Turn them to their side to keep the airway open. If they have been eating, clear the mouth. Note the time, and call for help if it goes over two minutes.",,,0.0

My wife hit me and got violent which involved the police arriving at the scene. Since I was in the Army, the Army separated us and I ended up getting very suicidal, which led to me to commit suicide. I was hospitalized and was put on suicide watch for 5 months and had to live in a conference room that the Army provided me. When I was discharged from the Army in June, I was involved in another domestic incident where my wife stabbed me. She was arrested and there was a protection order put in place.  She was released from jail when her mom bonded her out.  While all this happened, I was in the middle of finding a new home. I struggled finding a new home due to the lack of funds, and my bad credit score. I eventually managed to find a cheap home and my mom helped me cosign. I registered for school and had trouble with transportation due to my wife taking the car. My only source of income at the time was Mturk and I used it for Uber. I was fortunate to have met a Veteran that understood my situation and offered to give me rides to school. The next court date regarding my wife is not until October. I don't know what is to come but I hope that I will be financially and mentally ready for what's to come.",,,0.0

Not only was it a vacation, and not only was it a way for the whole family to get together and see each other (which rarely happens these days), it was also the last time we all figured we would be able to take a trip together with my grandfather, who had become quite frail over the past couple years. His condition was not improving, so we thought the trip would be a great way for all of us to bond with him at least one last time. The actual trip itself was fantastic. I had never been on a cruise before, and although I was slightly nervous given the way the media portrays cruises (i.e. Titanic), once I got on board I had forgotten all about that. The boat was huge and beautiful and there were friendly faces where ever you went. There were musical performances every night, and so many activities every day to do, from quiz shows based on disney properties, to learning how to fold towels into animals. There was even a theater on the ship, where I saw Coco for the first time (which I definitely teared up over). But the best thing was the food. There were a lot of restaurants, each with their own theme. Between buffets in the morning and five star meals in the evening, I was never hungry. My grandfather was with us for most of the activities, but there was one instance that gave us quite a scare. As I was moving around the ship with my sister, I received a message from my uncle telling me to come to his cabin immediately. Apparently my grandfather was really not doing well. When we got to the cabin the rest of the family was surrounding him as he laid still on the bed. There was a look of concern on everyone's face. My mom was trying to get him to eat a banana earlier, but he had stopped eating. As we were all looking at him worriedly, he suddenly jumped up and bit the banana that was in my mom's hand. We were all startled, but when his mouth curled into a smile, we all started laughing. It was the most memorable part of the trip for sure.",,,0.0

My job had to cut back my hours, so income has been tight and I have been running a little behind on bills. I have good credit and have never needed to take out a loan before. I figured now may be a good time to try, so I can pay down my outstanding debt before it gets out of hand. I was very nervous to apply. It took me a few days to get up the strength to do so. But then... my application was denied. At first, I felt guilty. Worthless. Like a failure. After a while, I started to feel frustrated and helpless. I don't even know why I was denied since my credit history is great and credit score is 750. I've never defaulted on a loan---in fact, I have never even taken one out before. So my only guess is my lower income resulted in the denial. How is someone supposed to get ahead in this world?",,,0.0

These were the last words he said to me…. You know what that “tomorrow” never came. X ( I am hiding the name ) was a good friend of mine. I first saw him in when I was in sixth standard. I guess he was a new admission in the school. He was very silent by nature. As I am a very talkative person so I always tried to persuade him to speak something. But he never changed his habit. Well that was too much annoying for me. Sorry, but I hate those people who always keep silent and don't express themselves. when he started to talk to me without my persuasion. He wasn't a brilliant guy so he often scored average in the exams. His desire to learn more brought him closer to me ( actually I was the topper of my class at that time. ) we became good friends there after. I was in eleventh standard when everything changed suddenly. I remembered that day he was very happy. He was talking to everyone and passing smiles to everyone in reply of a hello or hi. He was acting quite amusing that day. I didn't asked him the reason but I was happy to know he was enjoying his surroundings. Next day when I reached the school, I found that the environment of the class was quite disturbing. Almost everybody was standing in his own respective friend circle and was whispering. I sensed that something terrible has happened. When I enquired about the topic I was told that four of our school students who were coming to school on a motorcycle early in the morning have been brutally crushed by a truck.

I had worked immensely hard for the last one year and was really hoping to get a seat in GMCH. When my seat got confirmed there, I was elated. But more than me, my parents were happy. It was nice to see their proud faces. But that's a story for another day. Today is about the person who was the happiest that day - My GRANDFATHER. On the day of counselling, he accompanied me the office of the Director of Medical Education. On seeing my name in the list of the selected candidates for GMC, he was elated beyond measures. It could be seen in his face; it was being reflected in his eyes and his voice. We went home after the counselling was over. As the entire family sat for lunch, he suddenly called me to his room. I went inside grandpa gave me a box, somewhat twice the size of a typical geometry box, and it looked very old. I opened the box - it contained the equipments I'd be needing for MBBS in the 1st year. I smiled as he gave the box to me. He then said the following words which I'll never be able to forget. He said - “Annu, I had brought this set almost 20 years back. As I was passing by one of the medical supplies shop during my trips (he's a surveyor), my eyes fell upon this box. It was expensive at that time, and more than that- unnecessary, yet, I still bought it, hoping that someday I can give it to my children or grandchildren. You've fulfilled my dream today. Maybe, God wanted me to witness this. Maybe, He has kept me alive for this day only.” That day, I'll make you proud in the truest sense.",,,0.0

I was happy as I was going into a new phase of life.  I would have endless opportunities and be more of an adult. However, I never too the time to look at the downsides. With this feeling of independence came additional feeling of loneliness. I never stopped to think about how my life would change for the worse. Lots of my friends were going to different colleges and different cities.  Many of the people that I grew up, I would no longer see so often again. My entire life in terms of the social relationships that I had formed would go on to change.  I would only really come to the brunt realization when I had to say goodbye to my friends. I had stayed home to go to a local college so I had to watch many of my friends leave.  Also when I saw that many of these friends were going on to make new friends, the situation become even more difficult.

Last year, I decided to take my chances with dating websites, and see who was out there for women my age. I am a little unusual, in that I am a professional musician, and keep strange hours. I am also looking for someone who is not your run-of-the-mill person. After going on many dates with different people, and meeting mostly alcoholic ne'er-do-wells, I met a very interesting man who was a blues musician. We instantly were attracted to each other, and embarked on a 4.5-month-long, very passionate relationship. It just ended two and a half weeks ago, because he went back to his old girlfriend. I discovered that was his plan pretty much all along. I believed dating at my age would be easy, because I thought people would know what they want in life. What I found was that people have an inordinate amount of baggage, much more than they do in their 20s and 30s. Maybe I'll meet someone else; I sure hope so. Falling in love over 60 is rough. This is because you aren't sure it will ever happen again. I don't want to grow old alone. I believe I have a whole lot to offer someone.",,,0.0

I headed to class at my usual time of 10:00 a.m.  I decided to stop by the convenience store and grab a coffee and a snack on the way. That was a huge mistake. I was standing in line waiting to pay for my items when I hear someone scream loudly! I look towards the sound and see a man holding a woman at gunpoint. Another man emerges with a gun and tells the cashier to empty the cash register into a bag. The cashier complied and the men ran from the store. The cashier had tripped  the silent alarm, so the robbers were caught before they could get into their car. When all the police started streaming into the parking lot, with guns drawn, it was the most surreal feeling. Almost like watching a television show. Thankfully, nobody was hurt and the bad guys were arrested. The whole ordeal was over in less than 10-minutes. It was probably the most frightening 10-minutes I have ever experienced. I found out today that the robbers were teenagers. They will be tried as adults. I don't want to be afraid of going into a store for the rest of my life, but being in an armed robbery is very negative emotionally. This event did remind me to enjoy each day because we never know when it might be our last.",,,0.0

I took on a side job that lasted for over 3 nights. My side job included me planning and managing an exciting extra event  of the planned show. The event was organized to happen in different locations of the show area. In the locations there were settings made to surprise selected fans attending the show by deceiving them. One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.",,,0.0

Earlier this month I was finally able to get an assignment from a temp agency. Getting the job itself took planning and luck. I don't have a car so I had to take four buses and commute five hours to make it to the temp agency. Once there I had to submit my application all over again even though I filled one out online at home. The ""interview"" was rather unprofessional but I needed a job so I wasn't going to complain. I took my drug test and received my orientation date, then left. I made it back to the bus stop in good time so I didn't have to wait another hour. The rest of my commute went smoothly. While I waited on the bus that would begin my trip home, I received a phone call from the temp agency. In my haste, I missed a signature on my drug test paperwork. Without the signature my drug test would be invalid and I couldn't attend orientation. I was asked to come back and finish the paperwork, but I didn't want to risk missing buses back home. Since the orientation was scheduled for a few days later, I asked if I could just retake a drug test before the orientation.

I knew vague details of our family history, such as Great grandpa LeBrun marrying a native american woman from the Kalapuya tribe in Oregon and settling down on the Willamette river area, but there were a lot of details that were either never shared with me or forgotten. My younger sister got  a subscription to an ancestry website and the three of us started digging and telling stories. I learned that my Great great grandfather was part of a group that voted for the area that is now Washington State to become part of Canada. I also learned that my great grandfather was a tax collector that raised horses. Among all of these stories I learned that my great grandmother lost nine of her eleven children to diphtheria. The only reason my grandmother and her twin survived is because they were kept in the snow outside and warm bricks were wrapped up and changed 24 hrs a day.  My grandfather, her father, inherited a huge sum of money from his tax collecting father. At one time he owned 500 acres of Willamette Valley bottom land, (which now grows incredible wine grapes) He was the first in his family to graduate HS but couldnʻt get a job because he was half native american so he started drinking heavily. This led him to be missing or in jail for large portions of time, leaving my mom and her mother vulnerable to threats from the local KKK. She told me about being followed home as a child, how they would threaten to burn her house down. She was so sad when she told me about how they couldnʻt even afford a proper lock on the front door.

I had been a stay at home mother for seven years and earned my college degree while doing so. My last child was entering kindergarten and I knew I would have more free time. I got lucky and was offered an amazing job at my children's school. I prepared myself mentally to adapt to this significant change in my life and I was looking forward to earning an income again (and not just relying on my husband to be the financial provider) and being around other adults regularly. The first week of work was training. It was intense; much more intense than I realized it would be. I felt so out of place and my anxiety was at an all time high. By the last day of training, I was an emotional mess; I felt inadequate, under prepared, and completely out my element. I remember going home and having an anxiety attack which made me feel like I was dying. I was so upset, nervous, and sick that all I could think about was failing. It should be noted, that I am generally a very positive and confident person. I graduated top of my college class with a 4.0 GPA and received glowing recommendations. However, on that weekend, I felt like the lowest person in the world. My anxiety became so overwhelming, my husband was worried that this would do long term damage to my self worth. Monday morning at 6 am, I decided I couldn't do it. On the first day of school, I walked into the principle's office and quit. I felt like I let down everyone around me. It was awful. It was such an emotional day. After a few days of reflecting on everything that had happened, I decided I needed to get some help. I visited my doctor and got on a higher dose of anxiety medicine. Within a week, I was fine. and back to my old self. I decided to learn from this experience and work on my anxiety.",,,0.0

I was at a basketball game it was the championship game the crowd was packed everything was perfect the game was close the whole time all the way until the last play. I had the ball in my hands and I was ready to win the game. I went to the basket for the game winner and missed I was devastated. My team lost I was crying and it made me very emotional because I felt like I let everyone down. After the game we had the award ceremony the worst part I think was standing up trying to smile while receiving runner up trophies. It was the best season that we had and it all came down to one play and I couldn't get it done. It was a lot of emotions going around because my family had came to watch the game and I wanted to put on a show. This event is very significant to me because it showed me how to lose. Winning is probably one of the best feelings in the world but you learn more from a loss. That's why I chose to talk about this story and not any other. This writing task was challenging, and fun in any ways. It made me think while also reminiscing it was a very interesting task. It brought up feelings of regret, anguish, and lastly relief. Mainly because I know that moment is over and it helped shape who I am today I don't have to take it as a failure. This task overall was very fun and interactive as a whole. I look forward to performing well in the second portion.",,,0.0

I was going shopping for a birthday present with my little cousin(she's 8). So we went in, and spent about 45 minutes just browsing around the store, trying to pick a toy that she would like. My little cousin wasn't sure which toy to pick, but I told her that it couldn't be more than 20 dollars. However, she insisted that she wanted this miniature action figure that was well beyond the price range we had agreed on. When I firmly told her no, she began throwing the biggest tantrum I had ever witnessed. She was crying her lungs out, and no matter what I did, there was no quieting her. Given that I detest when children do this, I forcefully grabbed her by her wrists and got her out of the store empty handed. Not only did she not get the toy she wanted, but I told her that she could forget about getting anything else. She looked at me with eyes of rage, and just stopped talking to me for a few days after that. My aunt wasn't particularly happy with the situation but she took my side that it was the best thing that I could've done. That doesn't mean that I felt happy by the outcome, but I think teaching kids at early age that throwing fits like those are not going to solve problems. A few days before her birthday, I went and had a serious talk with her explaining how what she did was wrong. She eventually apologized, and told her that if she still wanted a toy. She ended up just going for ice cream, saying that she didn't want anything else. Fortunately, her birthday was a success, and seemed quite happy for having all her family and friends with her. I did ended up buying her that toy that she wanted because I think she showed maturity when she apologized for what she did, and wanted to reward her for that.",,,0.0

The weather was not too hot and not too cold, there was also a nice breeze and the water was just right. I think the fact that I had enjoyed myself so much on that day signaled a sign of a good summer. There were a lot of fun things that happened on the beach. I played with my dog. We both went swimming and I laughed at the way he swam. I had also remembered to bring my fishing pole, as there is a dock there. I was not lucky enough to catch anything. However, I still appreciated the meditative atmosphere of the act of fishing in itself. Even though I was not able to catch anything, I still had plenty of various snacks and meals for my dog and I. The sunset at the beach was very beautiful. I enjoyed the wide array of colors, and the sounds of the birds as they wound down for the night. I left after dusk, and I did not encounter anyone there the whole day. I slept beautifully that night as I was plenty tired after a full days outing that I had just taken.

I think that I would like to talk about graduation day.  I have four daughters that I adopted from China. They are beautiful girls turning into beautiful and very special women.  As the school year for 2018-2019 was winding down, I was getting ready for my second daughter to graduate. This was an exciting time. She was very excited and could not wait to walk onto that stage. I was so proud of her. I couldn't contain myself. She exuded confidence and held her head up high.  She was always quite the go-getter. She signed up for many clubs and ran some of the clubs as well. She was always willing to help someone out and was liked by her teachers. I was proud of the way she carried herself. When she applied for college, she was accepted at every one she applied for. Of course she took the one that was at the top of her list. I write about graduation because right now I am getting ready to take her to college. She has had a jam-packed summer. She started her first real job and just completed it this week. She will always have that retail experience under her belt and will always be able to find a job in this field. If that wasn't enough, she took on a second part-time job as well. She also purchased most of the items for her dorm herself. Okay and if that's not enough, she has also accepted her first job at college. I digress. Watching her walk down the aisle at graduation was amazing.",,,0.0

I remember going to the wedding which was in my parents back yard.  I remember my brother had a very big smile on his face since he was getting married.  It was a very great time for our family and friends to get together for this big event.  I remember my brother walking down the aile.  I remember shortly after the bride came down  the aile after him.  It was a very exciting time.  SHortly after the ring boy came down and this was very funny because he fell over.  The end of the story is that they finally said there vows and got married.  After my family met for food.  It was a very fun time to say the least.  Everyone seemed very happy on this day!,,,0.0

I've always wanted to ride a motorcycle across the country while tasting delicious food along the way. It seemed like an idyllic adventure. Many tourists do it and the Top Gear episode on Vietnam was pretty great. In June, I had the opportunity to go and live out that dream. I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City which is still called Saigon there. I will be referring to it as Saigon. I'd been there a couple of times before and it was as chaotic as usual. The first time crossing the street was hard. I'm use to crosswalks, drivers stopping or atleast slowing down, and 95 percent less people on scooters and motorcycles (which from now on I will collectively call motorbikes) . In Vietnam, if you want to get from one side of the street to another, you just walk with confidence and predictability and the motorbikes will just move around you. Traffic in Saigon is madness. So many people, so many motorbikes, so many cars. And rules I didn't read up on. I bought a motorbike. It was a 125cc underbone scooter. Getting out of Saigon sucked. Heavy traffic and lots of exhaust fumes. But once out to Saigon and on a road less traveled, being on a motorbike, even an underpowered one, was incredible.",,,0.0

The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",,,0.0

I believe we're both strong enough to get through the rough times.  It was emotional seeing her walk down the aisle, knowing that she too was vowing to change her life forever to be with me.  With all our family and friends around, it was a major event in our lives.  The well-wishes and happy thoughts we received from people were very touching.  Seeing everyone come together for our special event was a moment I won't forget.  The excitement and jubilation of everyone was infectious.

For me however, there was nothing strange about it, it's very run of the mill.   For me, the strange part, is that I actually am taking the time to write it down.  The dream started with me laying on my childhood bed.  My mother in the next room started complaining about the noises outside her window and how she was trying to sleep.  I peaked out of my window and looked  towards the neighbors ' house, not much noise coming from there.  I decided to go outside and see what else was going on.  Ahh, this must be what she's barking about, a father showing his son how to use the recycling bins.   ""It's nothing Mom!""  I yelled as I headed back to the bed room.  In that instant I remember being semi conscious it was a dream and a voice, either my own, or maybe even the father outside made a comment somehow unknowingly on the situation: ""See when you work for 30 years, you earn the money to build a life for you so that you can enjoy your life after."" Unlike my mother's situation where she lay in bed jobless, complaining.  I went in the living room and noticed drawers full of pink starburst, ""Just like in real life.""  I thought, knowing I bought a bag about a week ago, having a brief second of knowing that this was all a dream.   Shortly however I was back to being unaware.  I thought about our neighborhood and what it would look like with a lake.   ""We could shoot all kind of game!"" Explained a man who was suddenly in my living room.  I asked ""Do you think they would stock it with bass?""  Figuring a hunter would know such things.  ""Of course!"" He replied.  I then realized that this was all a daydream.   To which point I thought if I told my mother she would try it and relax for a bit.  It kept going but I think this is a good summary for now!",,,0.0

I was just a child, but still I was forced to keep our family secrets. It affected me greatly, and because of those experiences I found it extremely hard to trust people. I wasn't allowed to have friends over like the normal kids, and my parents were often gone on the weekends. They would come back smelling of booze and drugs. Di-spite the circumstances, I still felt loved by my parents until I was a teenager. I never doubted my mother's love for me, but my father was a different story. His negative nature was very hard to deal with. I believe he didn't care for my sense of wit and humor, but one might say he was insecure. Eventually, I came of age and joined the military. It was during that time that my father became abusive with my mother and she finally decided to leave him. She came to the base where I was staying and attempted to gather her mind. I remember how distraught she was. I was unaware of the sheer abuse she had been protecting me from during my childhood. He then collaborated with a group of men from a drug affiliated gang. This was when my father's life went completely south. He began using meth rather than the upscale drugs from before. He was arrested on charges of drug trafficking, and spent a few years in the penitentiary.  Finally, nearing the end of his life, he drank. He drank so much in fact that he gave out on the toilet with a bottle of liqueur nearby.",,,0.0

She was born with Spina Bifida, therefore she's had bladder and bowel issues since birth. She had a bladder rupture that resulted in her stomach filling up with urine. It's terribly painful and life threatening so when we got to the emergency room they immediately prepped her for surgery. This isn't the first time it's happened, it's the third. Her urologist told me that when a patient has that many ruptures, the bladder is no good and they'll have to install an ileochimney. An ileochimney is a stoma created where they pull out part of the bladder and she will have to wear a bag on the outside of her bladder to catch the urine coming out. One good thing about it is that she won't have to catheterize anymore, so that's a bright point. I always cry when she gets sick but this time I really wailed, because I hate seeing her going through pain and knowing it might not be the last time. We were in the hospital for two weeks, and I was there for her every step of the way. Thankfully I have a great support system, so my 7 year old son was taken care of. My daughter is 11, has seen more pain and difficulty than most adults, and is the sweetest person in the world. I do everything I can to protect her and make her happy. She's feeling a lot better though. She's eating well, and in less pain. So from here forth we're just trying to get used to our new routine.",,,0.0

I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I had my family back together. The feelings I felt that whole day up until seeing him is just something I could never forget. He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish.",,,0.0

I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the ""sinner's prayer"" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except ""self help."" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this ""metamorphosis,"" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.",,,0.0

It was great to see the joy on his face when he did that. I got him a couple books that he really enjoys reading. This is because he is an avid reader. It was also fun watching him blow on the candles. After we were done unwrapping the presents, we all jumped in the pool. I had a great time swimming with my family during this time, and there were a lot of people swimming.  They enjoyed themselves as well. After we were done swimming, we went inside and chatted. We also played card games with the kids that were there. Overall, my nephew really enjoyed his birthday. I can't wait to see my family again like this.",,,0.0

We had been wishing to move out of Florida for years, even more so when she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. I worked really hard as a newspaper carrier for about a year to save to get us out of there. I had finally saved enough money to make the big move. We picked a date to move, May 3rd and I quit my job a month before then. I would have preferred to continue working but I developed carpal tunnel in my right hand and it was becoming too painful to both work and pack. After quitting I was more able to focus on packing and cleaning up. We already had an apartment waiting for and even had a down payment. Making the trip up was tough because we were also bringing our 3 cats. However, my grandpa and tio both offered to help and come with us to help with the move. The entire move was done in a rental car and uhaul that my grandpa drove. It was a lot of fun to drive through a lot of states as I have never been outside of Florida before this move. We would not have been able to make the trip and smoothly as we did without their help. The day we arrived it was raining and chilly outside and it couldn't have been more perfect. It's been life changing to move up here as I'm happier and my mom can breather much easier.",,,0.0

She went back to her own place. But i had an uneasy feeling. The following morning, i kept calling dad but his phone rang away with no response. I took my car and drove all the way to his place.

I woke up that morning to check my facebook and was able to see all the wonderful people that told me Happy Birthday this year.  Oh and by the way, my husband forgot my birthday!  After all I am 35 and as you get older the less people celebrate you on your birthday and the more you hate celebrating because it means you are getting older.  So, back to the rest of the day, I sat there alone all day and then got a call from my best friend Callie Jane.  She told me she was thinking about me but had also forgot the exact day of my birthday.  I understood as I have trouble remembering as well these days too.  I told her it was actually today and that we would be celebrating my birthday at Oscar's it is a local bar and grill.  She told me that she would definitely make it.  Well two hours later I get a call from my husband as he is getting off work at this time.  It was around 3 that afternoon.  He tells me that he is sorry that he forgot my birthday and that he had talked to my best friend Callie Jane as well.  He told me that she wanted to throw a party for me at her place and asked what kind of cake I wanted.  I said that was okay, and that I wanted a cheesecake because I do not like regular cake.  So the plans were set, I was going to her house for my birthday.  She called me later that evening and told me that we would have a fish fry and cake.  I think I was 21 the last time it happened.  I also love fish and knew she was getting me a cheesecake.  So anyways, fast forward to the day of my party.  We get there and she has balloons and it is all decorated just for me.  Her and her friend Cara, that I recently met, put the whole party together.  But wait, that is not it, they also had me a gift.  It was a munchie basket.  I also got a homemade necklace from Cara which I love.  So, the night was wonderful we had drinks and mingled with a bunch of people.",,,0.0

We had a difficult time choosing a country in Europe. We deliberated for months before this, before we finally decided that we should make the vacation more exciting. To this this, we decided to rule out Europe and choose a South American country or an Asian country. At the end, we decided to chose Japan. This is a complete surprise because I never had any intention of going to a country outside of Europe. After making our choice, we did some research, prepared and traveled to Japan. Arriving Japan felt like arriving at a different world or an alternate world. Everything just felt different and strange. I have been to two other countries outside the US, but they were countries that had quiet a similar culture to US so it was easy. Japan was a lovely country, the country felt so organised, maybe a bit too organised. I am someone who loves structure but I was overwhelmed by how structured everything was.  The Japanese people were very polite and friendly, we had bonus points for trying to learn how to speak their language. The Japanese people were neat almost to a fault. All the streets and public places were so clean that it felt like they all had germophobia. They were also incredibly disciplined, they always kept to their words. After three interesting weeks in Japan, my husband and I decided to come back to the US. We felt good coming back, but we couldn't stop ourselves from making a lot of comparisons.",,,0.0

I was alone in a remote area of northern Wyoming and heard a terrifying sound at about 3AM.  I had intended to camp at a developed site next to a lake because it was bear country and there were bear-proof storage boxes at the campsites.  When I arrived at the lake I was disappointed in the area, there was nobody there (it was a weekday) but it was obviously heavily used and a bit dumpy.  I decided to ride further down the dirt road to see what else there might be.  I came across a trail and after a mile or so there was a small clearing in the trees.  I thought that it would make a suitable site to set up the tent.  It was a bit eerie - there were forest fires in the region and the sky was reddish from the smoke, there was also Spanish moss hanging from the tree branches which added to the creepy atmosphere.  At any rate, I made dinner, enjoyed a beer and went to sleep at about 11PM.  I was awakened by a piercing scream at around 3AM, it was absolutely terrifying and I had never heard anything like it before.  All that came to mind at the time was that there was a large bird like a eagle outside the tent screeching at something.  As I listened I could hear it walking around the tent about 100' away, there were small branches breaking under it's feet as it walked along... whatever it was it seemed pretty big.  I was too scared to open the zipper and look outside the tent, I didn't want to draw attention to myself and have to deal with this thing up close.  After over an hour the sounds became more and more faint and I eventually drifted to sleep.  In the morning I examined the ground where I had imagined it had been walking.  I found some very clear large paw prints - it was a mountain lion!  I have never seen a mountain lion in the wild, and the sound that it was making that night was otherworldly, something I'll never forget.",,,0.0

Recently my kids came to visit for 3 days and we rented a boat for one day, but what was more enjoyable was the third day we drove to the Grand Canyon.  I had only seen it as a small child, 6 years old.  My husband had grown up not far from there.  My kids had never seen it.  Since I hadn't seen my kids in years, even the time driving there was enjoyable because we could ""catch up"" as well as the fact that they had never met my husband.  Once we got there we picked the tour that we felt my husband could best handle since he is visually impaired.  My kids were very patient  at not getting too far ahead of us and such.  We had a fantastic day.  We will never forget seeing a cliff with a small plateau and this mountain goat was just standing on the plateau.  Pretty amazing how it got there.  On way back we talked about times in our life when we had ""mountains in life"" to climb and how we got to the top.  Overall, just an experience that I hope to have again.",,,0.0

I used to stay in a basement area and it was really dirty and gross, and had lots of mold.

After almost a year of that, including being harassed non stop for not speaking Spanish, I was able to find another place in a different city away from the man and his awful habits. It only took a day to move out, since I do not have much stuff. I was able to move in with a friend, and my boyfriend and things are much better here. I have personal privacy now, whereas I did not before. I didn't even have a bedroom before in the basement. I had to sleep on the concrete floor with spiders and centipedes around. I hated it and I am glad I was able to move. I am not as depressed and anxious as I was before. I was always getting harassed by Hispanic people for being American and not speaking Spanish. There is no one here that harasses me now. I am currently trying to save up for my own place so that I do not have to deal with roommates ever again.

She had finished her first year of high school, and was starting her second.  She had changed quite a bit since I had last seen her earlier in the year.  She stood up straighter when she walked, and was more serious, in her face and the way she talked.  She seemed much more like a young adult than the child I had known for so many years.  She had her cellphone, and used it adeptly, like it was never difficult to learn.  She spoke more slowly and more eloquently, and I was able to have conversations about more serious topics with her.  As I talked to her that day, I wondered what she would be like as a 25 year-old adult in 10 years.  I wondered what her career would be, and if she would be married by that age.  I had always liked her as I watched her grow up and change, but this time was different.  For the first time, she was someone I could talk to as a young friend, not just a silly little girl with a short attention span.  I looked forward to hearing her stories about high school and college in the years to come.  I didn't just feel the love that I always felt, but this time I felt respect for the young woman growing up before my eyes.  I also wondered how she perceived me, this middle-aged man that she saw every few months, without really knowing much about him.

About 3 months ago, he had to stay in the hospital for 48 hours to be continually monitored. This had to be done due to concerns from his teachers. They were saying he seemed to be drifting off at random times and not responding. Because of them reporting this issue, we made an appointment with his neurologist. She stated that the only way to see if he was still having seizure activity was to monitor him for 2 days in the PICU. So we set a date and time and waited patiently for it to come around. The day of the test, we arrived very early. They showed us to his room and within an hour the tech was there to begin the process. As they attached the multiple amounts of electrodes to my young child's head, I began to get very emotional and I'm not sure why. It's hard to see your child has an issue. You feel like you may have done something wrong at some point to cause it. All of my family came to visit my son while he was in the hospital and it was very heartwarming that everyone came together to be there for him. The best part about the whole situation was that the test showed no new seizure activity. This means that hopefully he will grow out of his condition over the next few years and can completely wean off of seizure medication and enjoy a normal teenage and adult life.",,,0.0

It was not my fault at all, some imbecile ran a stop sign and t-boned me. However, the idiot told the cops I ran a red light, and since there were no witnesses, it was a mess. However, luckily for me, I had  a dashcam installed only a few weeks prior. I was able to go to my insurance company and tell them I had footage. They took this footage to the other insurer and I was offered damages for my car. I refused and said I wanted damages and diminished value for my car, since if I try to sell it, it will come up as a car that was in a wreck. Initially they refused, but since I had a tape of what had happened, I was eventually able to get damages plus diminished values. It took way longer than it should have and I was in a rental car for over 2 weeks.  However, on the plus side, the rental car was a really cool Jeep that I would have never driven before. It was brand new, with only a couple hundred miles on it. It was like having an extended test drive. And that test drive happened to be free eventually. I hated having to do this because insurance companies move so slowly. I had to initially pay for the rental without knowing if I would get reimbursed.",,,0.0

They were visiting from overseas so I was showing them around. We went to a place of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in San Pedro. The location is called Cabrillo Beach. There is a pier and a long jetty alongside it that leads to a lighthouse. It was a very dark night and you could see the lights of the port and the homes shimmering on the hillside, but it was so dark that you could not readily identify the people that were walking along the pier. As we were walking along the pier, I could see the bonfires on the nearby beach, it was a surreal look because of the contrast of color due to the darkness around us. There were occasional fireworks shooting off from a park above on the nearby hillside as well, it all gave me a surreal feeling, the colors clashed and really created a festival like atmosphere. I also saw the colors of the fishermen's lures on the water, people walking along the shore with the light from their phones visible, I heard music in the distance. It was a unique type of night. I would talk about the things going on with my family and how this was such a unique experience. The most memorable part however was when a large cruise ship came into harbor. It was off in the distance and got larger and larger until in entered the harbor. The various lights of the ship were glistening, it's reflection on the water lit up the whole area. As it came in I was able to see the passengers on the balconies waving, although we could not see each other I felt the human connection of all the people around me.",,,0.0

It was something that really opened my eyes to what my health and in turn my life could be like. This story is about a revelation of sorts that Living healthy and happy is something that I can achieve. One of the key moments in this story was when I met my all time fitness idol, ""the mountain"". It was a glorious day as I started getting in to strength training and fitness a couple of years ago when I went through a deep depression. This was a very significant event for me because fitness and strength training specifically changed my life. When I met my idol I was awestruck at how big he was but like me, he started somewhere. He told me consistency is key and even when you desperately want to give up, you have to push even harder and faster to break through it. His advice was so invaluable to me at the time because I had felt like giving up many times. I had him autograph a picture I had of him winning a strongman competition. This was such a great experience as It really motivated me to get better and stronger, which I did. I worked harder than ever after meeting him and realizing anyone can be strong with the work put in. I have realized that with almost everything in life, consistency is the most important thing which is what the experience taught me. I now try to be consistent in everything I do and it has paid off big time in the long run. I have been successful in all areas of my life so far by doing this.",,,0.0

We were very excited about the first journey. On the second day, we took an elevator to go up for a breakfast buffet. In the elevator, there was a lady and we did strike a small talk about the nice travel. During the breakfast, my wife didn't say anything but just eating. I didn't really know why she was upset and later got to find out that she was very uncomfortable about my talking to the lady in the elevator. She said she felt ignored by me. I said, it was just a casual conversation and I didn't have anything to do with the woman. My wife however kept saying she was unhappy and this trip made her very depressed. I felt upset too because of her ridiculous behavior and mindset. However, I didn't want to ruin the rest of the time, and we made love in the cabin. She was hesitant in the beginning about my signal for having sex, but she seemed to be agreeable on it. It was good, or should I say much better than a normal sex at home partly because of the trouble and getting lid of it by expressing our feeling for forgiving each other. Four weeks after the travel, I was very busy at work and she called me saying she thinks she was pregnant. Oh my gosh! What a nice surprise because we had a hard time having a baby for a long time! We presume that the emotional sex during the cruise made it happen and we were so happy. Life is unpredictable.",,,0.0

This happened at a previous job I worked for a few months back. At the time I was ushering at a convention center. My responsibility was to greet the people and direct them to their seats for the event. on that night my favorite band was going to be performing. At the time I didn't know they were going to play because I did not thoroughly read about the event prior. They were the last to play onstage. After they had played a few sets it was time for their last song. Before the last song started one of my managers  told me that the lead singer was going to walk by the upper stadium were I was at during the start of the song. This was exciting for me and I almost could not breathe because I really loved the lead singer and was very fond of him. Just as stated before he did walk by were I was as he song the last song. I was so close to him that I patted him on his side to get his attention. He didn't hear or see me because it was so loud in their and security guards were pushing people away from him. Even though I couldn't talk to him I was content with seeing him up close and touching him. After that night I moved on to work some were else. It was the perfect way to end my last night at that job though",,,0.0

He wanted what was best for me, He wanted to see my grow and do better as a person overall. I appreciated everything he did for me. I also appreciated him trying to make the most out of a bad situation. I feel most people wouldn't be able to do that, but my uncle was a strong minded person. You rarely, if ever would see him feeling down about himself or week about something. He knew that life was never always going to be great and peaches and roses. But he would make the best of each and every scenario possible. That's one thing I will miss about him and forever remember, just how strong of a person he was inside. He was like a second father to me with how he treated me and did stuff for me and with me. I could never forget any of the conversations we had that night. I swear we talked for at least 3 hours just about life, the future, the past. Literally just everything you could think of, we discussed.",,,0.0

This actually just happened 2 days ago. I am a senior in college majoring in nursing, and have worked hard the past 3 years to do well in my classes and get good grades. As a result, I have a high GPA (3.9) and so I was eligible to join the Honor Society. It started with an email sent to me inviting me to join. Once I decided to join, I signed up online and paid the fee. What was extra special was that my parents offered to pay the fee for me because they knew it was important for me to join and they wanted me to be recognized for all my hard work. Then, this past Monday was the induction ceremony. I was a little disappointed because my parents were unable to attend, but two of my friends came instead. I dressed up in a nice dress, picked up my friends, and we went to the ceremony. There was a speaker who presented her research project, and then it was time for the induction. One of my professors read off all of our names (only 7 people in my class were invited to join), and we all went up individually to sign our names in the booklet, receive a certificate, and receive purple cords that we will wear at graduation. Afterwards we took pictures and ate cake. It was a really special night and it was nice to be recognized for my hard work. I appreciated my friends coming to support me. I am proud of myself for this accomplishment and for almost making it through nursing school.",,,0.0

We continued to bounce around and have fun but eventually we headed back to our apartment. At the time we were living together as friends.

I’ve been scared for this day beings that I didn't enroll my oldest. I spent weeks shopping for school clothes. Her first outfit was a French schoolgirl skirt and a polo. She isn’t in private school, but I want her to be a smart kid that is very involved in her schoolwork. She was so excited; this mommy was so scared. She enrolled late, one because I didn't have her social, secondly because I was so scared. See she isn't my youngest... She’s my second youngest but somehow, I have kept her more innocent than the rest.  What if kids teach her thing, I don't feel she should know. She’s only 5. I didn’t have a chance to meet the teacher much due to her being late. They told me quick goodbyes is the best. That scared me more. On the other hand. She just walked right into that gym. Let go of my hand and found her way with little help from me. I didn’t want to give a quick goodbye what is she was scared? Well she wasn’t scared she just wanted her mommy to go away. That’s when I realized this is much scarier to let my girl grow her wings and her freedom than it is for this mommy to allow her to grow her wings. I know she’s going to fall sometimes. I know she is going to learn things I am not okay with. She’s also nicer than myself to others (which was always my goal) so that mean she is going to get bullied sometimes. I just hope I taught her how to correctly stick up for herself. I hope I taught her right and wrong well enough. Lastly, I hope I have taught her and am still teaching her that I will always be here, If she did something wrong, I will be there to help her, If she falls, I will be there to catch her.",,,0.0

When I turned the key it was apparent this was not going to be a normal day as I was greeted with a ""rrrur rrurr"". After a few more futile key attempts I popped the hood and noticed corrosion on battery terminal. No big deal, I'll just remove the corrosion and will be good to go, which I did and I was, until the next day. To my frustration I was greeted with the same ""rrur rrur"" the following day. Again, popped hood took a look not really any new corrosion, but i thought maybe the inside of the terminal connectors needed cleaning. While removing said connector it broke, not good. The corrosion had weakened the metal causing it to be brittle. No big deal, i'll just go get a new connector, which I did. Installed new connector and all was well in the world again, or so i thought. Three days later was again greeted with the too familiar ""rrur rrur"" when attempting to start the car after walking out to said car with groceries. Had to get a jump and limped back home. Back to the drawing board trying to decipher the car code. Decided the cheaply made recently purchased battery terminal connector was the issue, so got a stronger and better made one. Unfortunately while in the process of replacing said connector a small cable from the battery was accidentlly severed. After replacing the connector we now had to trace the small cable back and replace that. Finally done with all! Until I went to start the vehicle and heard the frustrating ""rrur rrur"". Stumped, frustrated, angry, happy, sad, all emotions under the sun, finally decided to replace the battery (that was tested by a shop that said it was a little low but ok). After replacing the battery peace was once again restored to the kingdom! All told, 7 days to fix the issue. Why not take it to shop some may ask? That takes money and we had none. The end.",,,0.0

It was 3 years on June 14th so we drove up into Cherokee, North Carolina from Georgia in order to go camping. We left in the morning and first went to the shops went we got into Cherokee and we got awesome new moccasin shoes that were fuzzy on the inside for our lazy few day trip. We drove into the campground after we ate a burger in town for dinner. Pitching the tent was really fun, because my two dogs were attacking the poles as we were trying to set it up; my girlfriend was laughing and smiling cheek to cheek. We got the tent pitched and decided to get the fire started before we brought our supplies into the tent, so I went up to the main office to buy some kindle and firewood. I built a massive fire with the help of my girlfriend and she took all the credit to herself as per usual. She's always proud of herself for funny things like that. We brought a plastic chest full of snacks and supplies so we would definitely not go hungry. Usually couples go out to dinner and date, but we ate out of cans for 3 days! I think this is definitely a main reason why I lover her. We don't have to be like every other couple. We're unique. When we were done there; we didn't want to leave. Neither did the dogs! We watched all of our movies we had downloaded on our computers and drained our powerbank so we couldn't charge our phones, so being a 21st century couple, we went back to civilization! I had a blast and I know we will never forget our awesome time.",,,0.0

I tripped on that broken basement step that I keep forgetting to fix.   I was carrying a jar of  pickles at the time, and when I fell, the jar broke and badly cut my hand and wrist.  I couldn't get the bleeding to stop, so I called an ambulance.  It was embarrassing to have to call them, but I was losing a lot of blood.  They put a tourniquet on it and took me to the emergency room which was less than 5 minutes.  The damage was pretty bad and the cuts were jagged so they had a lot of trouble getting it sewn together.  They used a lot of glue on top of the stitches as well.  It didn't hurt very much, but I wouldn't realize until the next day that that was a bad sign.  They wrapped the whole thing in a large bandage and I went home.  It wasn't for another hour or more before I realized I couldn't feel anything in my last two fingers.  I thought maybe the bandage was wrapped too tight and ignored it, but the next day I took some of the wrapping off and realized that I didn't have feeling in the fingers or that part of  my palm below them either.  I also couldn't spread my fingers or move them much.  I was still hoping a lot of this would heal, but I looked online and saw that I might have some permanent damage.  It was  depressing news, and I was pretty upset about possibly not being able to use the hand again, but since I don't have insurance, there wasn't much I could do except to hope that when the swelling came down some, it would improve.  Unfortunately, I found over the next week that the hand would never come back to the way it was before.  Fortunately it was my left hand and I was able to compensate for it pretty well, but there are some things I can't do and if people look at it closely, they could see that the two smaller fingers are permanently bent in a weird way.

We had a lot of fun.  One of our kids brought a friend with him, and she was very respectful and engaging with the younger kids.  It's pretty late in the season.  Not many apples were left on the trees.  Most of the Honeycrisps were gone.  We ended up getting mostly Macs and some Cortlands and Empires.  A lot of the apples were high up on the trees.  I lifted up our youngest a couple of times to reach them.  I had to lift up our oldest, too for some of the apples.  We eventually found a ladder.  The kids all climbed up on the ladder and we got a picture of them.  There was also a playground at the apple orchard.  It was a playground made mostly with farm equipment.  There was a fort built around an old tractor.  There were also a bunch of big tractor tires in a sand pit.  The kids really enjoyed that.  The store had apple cider donuts.  Those were delicious.  The boys had a lot of fun at both the apple orchard and the pumpkin patch.  We don't get to go out all together very often, so it was very touching.",,,0.0

The little people i had raised all pulled together to organize something especially for me. Usually they are doing more fighting than working together. It moved me so much, that it brought tears to my eyes. y children seen how moved I was and also started to cry along with me. they had purple balloons all over,  and an separate table was filled with gifts just for me. I was able to sit at the head of the table in a chair that had ribbon taped to it. The chair felt special I felt special that day.

She said maybe. A couple days before the festival I asked if she had her schedule. To find out if she would be able to make it. She said she would be able to make it, and we can meet up there. She didn't give a set time she would be there. So I spent the entire day at the festival. Around mid day she showed up in her work uniform. I asked her if she was just getting off work. She looked frustrated, almost to the point of tears when she told me she was just heading in. They had suckered her into taking an extra shift that night. But she wanted to let me know she wouldn't be able to make our date. I was disappointed, but touched that she wold come down in person to tell me that. A few minutes after she left, I felt a small hand at the small of my back. I turned and it was her. She was frantic. She had lost her key and was wondering if I had seen it. I immediately offered to help her look. She took off towards her car, and I followed, looking around. Her friends spotted her running off in a frantic state, with a man following her. They came running after us, they calmed a bit after hearing about the key, but they still stayed between the two of us for the rest of the search. As we were almost to her car I spotted the edge of something black at the under a thick bush. It was her key! She was so happy to have it back that she threw her arms around me to hug me. The look of happiness on her face as she did is something I will never forget.",,,0.0

I was really excited about this gig because it was difficult to get, it payed really well, plus I got our whole band of 10 people free drinks as well as nice meals from this hotel club gig. We arrived at the venue around 6:30pm, as the booking agent had requested for a sound check. The venue was beautiful, and as it turns out, has a great reputation and is a valued spot to get into. We set up, ran our sound check with most of the band, except our new saxophone player. She showed up a bit later, but still in time to get some sort of sound check. She asked about dinner and myself and our two singers handed her a menu. I told her that her meal is compt, but her boyfriends would not be. This was the first time any of us had ever seen her boyfriend, or even heard of him existing, but we didn't think too much of it because she'd only been playing with us for a few months. We all eat, then it's show time. We play our first set, the people love it, so does the booking agent. We take a set break, then return to the stage for set 2 of 3 for the night. Also well received.  We take our second set break, and suddenly, our saxophone player says she has to go and didn't know we were playing ""so late"".This seemed very strange to all of the rest of us, as the whole show should be done in another hour, which still would be relatively early, by usual musician standards. Her announcement was made even more strange by her ""boyfriend"" standing arms crossed, looking very menacing at everyone, telling her repeatedly, ""we got to go"". She seemed under duress. Her mouth was saying things that didn't match up to her body language. This made things very uncomfortable for everyone, except her boyfriend, who was bad vibing everyone. I immediately thought out the many ways this could go down, and decided to not argue, but just to let her go before the start of our last set of the night. We were all very upset by this, but after she and her boyfriend left, we all talked about how letting her go was the best thing to do, and also a fire able offense at a gig. On top of all of that drama, the boyfriend ate for free, and we got stuck with the bill at the end of the night! Just in case she was being abused by this boyfriend, we told her family what had happened, and how it all seemed really strange to all of us, male and female in the band. Never heard from her again, and not sure what ever happened. It made me sad though, as I did like her, and had looked forward to making music and a friendship with her.",,,0.0

He hit me up and told me he was going to get V.I.P. ,for his birthday and buy two bottles. I was like okay, I'll be there. I chilled at the crib for the day and started to get prepared around 8pm. Left my crib around 9 30, and prepared to drive above the speed limit since I didn't want to be too late. As I'm driving, I play my favorite tracks to get me hyped for the club. The club was about 1 hour away from my crib. I get there around 11, due to traffic and park my car. Walk to spot and see 2 people I know. One of them was a friend who played on the basketball team with me and high school, so i shook his hand; the girl I knew from science class back in high school so, I gave her a hug. I waited in line for  about 15 minutes and got inside. The party was lit. So many beautiful woman around. I walked upstairs swerving through people since it was crowded to get to V.I.P. I gave my friend who was his birthday, shook his hand and said happy birthday bro. It was a crazy experience, girls where just walking up to me while I was in V.I.P. ,like I had money.

About two weeks prior to the ride I told a friend that I was going to do it someday.  She blew it off as a ""someday, yeah right"" moment.  The day before the ride, I was supposed to go on a date and the woman at the very last moment cancelled on me... again.  She said she'd make it up to me the next day.  Rather than say ""yeah, no problem"" I went with ""I'm going to busy, I'm going to be naked on a bike in Chicago tomorrow.""  She scoffed and thought I was joking.  That was when I decided, I was going to actually do it.I have a hybrid mountain bike that I use for easy trails around Illinois and pulled it out of my garage.  Checked it out by going for a ride around the lakes near my house.  During the ride, I saw a couple that I knew and we stopped and talked a few minutes.  They told me that they we also planning on going to bike.  Small talk, said hope to see them there and I continued my ride around the lake.Next morning, day of the ride, the woman I was supposed to go on the date with the previous evening text me ""Hey, are you mad at me? Call me"". Conversation ensued as to what my plans were for the night.  She then asked ""are you mad at me?""  I responded with ""No. Can't be really be mad a mosquito when it's just following its natural instincts."" She hung up.I get down to the park where we're supposed to meet at the ""secret"" location.  I get routed to a warehouse where there's about 100 riders all in various states of dress.  Looking around, I realize I didn't bring my water bottle.  I'd left it in my car, I realize I had only parked about a 3 minute ride from it and went back.  On the return trip to the rider assembly area, I see a gorgeous woman taking out her bike from the back of her car.  In passing I tell her that the staging area is this way.  The reason I tell her this is that the ""secret"" meeting location is about 1/2 a mile in the other direction. That's how I met my new girlfriend.",,,0.0

Unfortunately she hasn't been able to care for her in the right way, due to mental health issues. This resulted  in my granddaughter's removal from my daughter's home. My granddaughter was placed in my temporary care for the past 12 months. I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.",,,0.0

There were no imposing buildings or monuments as there are in New york, from were we had just come. After cycling for about half-an-hour, my brother got bored and said, ""Come on, I''ll race you to that corner. There loser treats the other to a chocolate, okay?""""Okay, one, two, three!"" I said, and then we were off. This was not the first time we had raced. Only my brother had invariably neaten me and the crowed about it for days. I was determined to win this time. I pedalled as fast as I could. My legs ached and my skirt billowed out, threatening to hit my face. The trees on either side of the road had become one green blur.

Being his best man was a great honor and I am very grateful that he chose me to be so. My brother has a number of really close friends who could have easily performed the duties of first man, but he chose me. The wedding was beautiful. Family and friends came from all over to be there. Amber, the bride, looked stunning and her bridesmaid's also. We rented a farmhouse next to a lake as the venue. The weather was perfect, which is a rare occurrence in the deep south. Not too hot and not too cold.  The only potential problem was me. I have a terrible fear of public speaking and the best man is required to do a lot of that. But it was my little brother's wedding. I had a duty and the great honor of being the best man. I could not fail him or let my anxiety rule the day. In this case, being the best man also afforded me the opportunity to be there for my family and little brother and to work on myself as a human being, conquering my anxiety about public speaking and rising to the occasion. I learned that most anxiety is anticipatory, and that once the speech has begun, things are easier. So the speech and toast went off without a hitch.
