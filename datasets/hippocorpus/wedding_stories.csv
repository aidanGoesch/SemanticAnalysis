The caterer did fantastic, and the venue we used was absolutely perfect, and extremely affordable. The only part that was a bit bothersome was with it being a wedding, and so many people, I didn't get much time to chat with each person, as I would have liked to. The photographer did an excellent job, and I helped her out by being a joker and keeping people laughing and smiling which helped with pictures. I was overwhelmed with the amount of people we had there, and probably felt as loved and important as I ever have in my life on account of all the people there. I don't get to see him too often, so when I do I take full advantage and try to enjoy every moment as much as possible. My wife looked gorgeous (as usual), and I am overly thankful to spend the rest of my life with her. I've come to realize that's just how weddings are with so many people and only so much time, that it's part of the gig. We opted to not go too overboard, and had under 100 guests total. Just a matter of months ago I got married for the first (and hopefully last) time in my life. Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents were there as well, as they are very important to me. It did rain a little bit, but we managed to dodge the brunt of it, which was good as we had planned and hoped to have it outdoors. We did have a backup plan if we would have to move it inside, but we were hoping that we could keep it outdoors. As one would expect, it was a very significant step, and a very special moment in my life. I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. All in all it will go down as one of the most memorable and enjoyable days of my life. Everything went very well, and the memory of that day will stay in my mind, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life. Besides our immediate family, I had my best friend come up from across the country to be my best man. But beyond that, it was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed myself a great deal.",2.0,"A few months back, I got married. The wedding went very well, and I will never forget the day.
