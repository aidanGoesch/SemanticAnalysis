There was this dude called Gregory. He wanted to come - he wanted to go on a sports game. I think his mom was stopping him from doing so. Then the rest of the story is just to have some chat with his friend. I don’t know his name, Jack something but I know about the main person. His name is Gregory. [Pause] So, this Gregory went to – plays a sports game. Yes, I didn’t really understand the story. He wants to be in some sports team. Yes. [Pause] It’s wrong. [Pause] His name is Gregory. His friend was shouting. He wanted to go to a sports game but he couldn’t. It was baseball or something. His mom was restricting him or something similar. He was asked why it matters but he wanted to go really badly. He had lost it. He was looking at this and doing problems and stuff. He really, really wanted to go to the sports event or something, baseball. His name was Gregory. I think the other friend’s name was Jack-something. I couldn’t really understand. You change the complexity of the story. I think his name was Gregory or something like that. He was talking and stuff. The name was Gregory. He wanted to go to the sports event. He wanted to go to the sports event but couldn’t. His name was Gregory. He couldn’t go to a sports event. He was really frustrated. He was like, “Why is this happening to me? I really wanted to go.” He really wanted to go to the sports event, but other than that, I can’t recall any of this part of the story. [Pause] All I know is Gregory. I’m done.
