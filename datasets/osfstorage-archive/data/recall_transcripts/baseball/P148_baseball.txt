His mom and his siblings were all proud, but not only that he had that letter, that one letter. He had another letter, and it was from somebody like one of his crushes. He opened it and it said that her and her brother were going to visit that day. The snow was getting harder. It was coming down harder, so the weather was bad and he decided like, “Should I go or not?” He decided to. Then while he was walking, he was thinking about him and his baseball career.
