The story began with the mention of a person with bronze skin after which they progressed to Joe’s home. He was speaking with his sister about the potential of making more money playing baseball with a semi-pro team. She was skeptical but thought it would be amazing. They proceeded on to their parents’ home where the mother was there. She questioned him, basically asking if it’s the right thing or that’s the right thing for him to do. He explained that he could make more money by playing. It wasn’t considered a major league franchise championship league or team but a higher-level team than its local team and that he would just have a chance to pitch and do what he loves to do. He then proceeded to catch a train to meet with the team to sign his contract then meet the players. 
As he arrived at the train station, the personnel working at the train station congratulated him and told him that there was no way he was going to make the trip today. It was going to be delayed and I think they said it would take at least a week or two for the issue to be resolved and him the ability to make it to his destination. [Pause]  [Pause] It sure seemed like I talked for four minutes. My green circle is still green. It has yet to turn yellow. I’ll do a better job of timing myself on the next scenarios but I did say  I did press the letter D key. Nothing’s happening. [Pause] Okay. Well, I’m just going to hang in here until at least 5:48 PM. Here we go. We got yellow. So,  Press the letter D.
