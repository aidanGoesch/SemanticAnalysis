So, there was a guy that was visiting his family and he’s a baseball prospect. He is talking to his sister whose name is Clara for a long time. He was reading letters that he got and reading them to her and then talking about how good he was at baseball. Then, his mom came in and they were talking about baseball some more. He was talking about different teams. He mentioned Philadelphia. He was talking about trying to get really good so that he could be in major leagues. They also talked about him being drafted in baseball. His mom made a joke about how it sounded like wartime and she didn’t want him to get drafted because it reminded her of the war so that’s not what it meant. Then, at one point, he was reading a letter from, I think, a fan of his and he ended up leaving and getting on a train and seeing some people that he knew. But before that, basically, they were just talking about baseball for a long time. They kept mentioning different teams that he was going to try and play on. It sounded like it was probably not in modern times because he was reading letters. He also mentioned that somebody, some friends of theirs were going to come over, and his sister seemed pretty excited about that. I think his mom left at one point. Besides that, they were just mostly in one room from what I could tell until at the end when he left. He saw some people that he knew on the train and he was trying to think of how he could help them, but he was on his way to go to his more baseball training, but for most of the time, he was just talking to his family and they were asking him a lot of questions about baseball. It seems like he wasn’t in the major leagues, but he was trying to work his way up and was on his way to go train. His name, I don’t remember, but his sister’s name was Clara, and he mentioned his coach I think in one of the letters also, but it read kind of like a Buck.
