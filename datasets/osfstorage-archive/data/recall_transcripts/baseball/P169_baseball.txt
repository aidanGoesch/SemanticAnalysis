The story was about Joe and his sister Clara. At the beginning, Joe receives some letters and Clara's anxious for him to open them. Joe’s a pitcher who plays for - sounds like a local or minor league type baseball team. He's practicing his pitching when his mom walks in carrying a jug of something and he accidentally knocks it over. He opens the letters and one is from the St. Louis Cardinals letting him know that he's being scouted and possibly he'll be drafted. Him and Clara are very excited about this and his mom, that he might be drafted into a major league baseball team. Joe is musing about possibly being a Major Leaguer and how he didn't expect it. His team that he's currently on is going to be sad to see him go because he was the best player on their team. Joe receives another letter from friends letting him know that they're coming into town via the train, so he asks Clara if she wants to go to the train station with them and she says no. He walks down at the train station himself, but it's snowing out. He gets to the train station and talks to the manager or person working at the train station, asking them about this train coming in, and the person tells him that he might be waiting a few days because it's snowed in and they're not going to be able to - the train won't be arriving that day. Joe is surprised and a little anxious because his friends are on the train that's snowed in and it's not going to get there. Then the story ends at that point. [Pause]
