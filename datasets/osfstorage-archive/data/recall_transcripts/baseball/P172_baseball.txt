Joe was opening mail. He and his sister was there with him. He got a letter from someone on a baseball team that said he might not be with their team anymore as a pitcher, and he was going to go to a St. Louis team instead, which was a major league team. He was practicing - he was swinging his arms around, and his mother came in with a pitcher to water some plants that were outside attached to the house in a planter maybe, and he somehow struck this lady - or not the lady, but he somehow knocked the pitcher out of her hands, and the pitcher broke and water went all over the place, and he - she thought her floor was ruined, and he was able to wipe up the water on the floor, so it was fine. The pitcher broke, I don't remember if I said that, but the mom was glad that she didn't bring out a different pitcher that she liked more, and no one was mad. There was another letter that was from some friends that were coming through their town to visit, and it turned out that they were coming through that day on a train, and it was snowing out, and Joe went to the train station through the snow thinking about the baseball situation and him having to switch teams, and possibly - and how that might affect things. He got to the train station and the - talked to someone there, and they didn't - they thought that the train was snowed in, or maybe it was for sure snowed in, that all the trains were delayed because of the weather, and it seemed like Joe wanted to try to help his friends but he didn't know what to do, and I think that's where it ended. So, I am done
