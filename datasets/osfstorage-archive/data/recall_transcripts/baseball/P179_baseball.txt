So, Joe and Clara are in their room and they got mail. Clara asks if it’s about their dad, and Joe says no. They open up the mail and it’s something about baseball, and Clara thinks Joe’s not able to play baseball with his former team. They’re talking about that and Joe is upset, and then the mom comes in – no. Before that, Joe was practicing his swings to show Claire, and then the mom comes in and then spills water, and then she gets the water knocked out of her hands because Joe was practicing his swings, and that the mom and Clara both scream, and then they all talked for a while, and then they clean up the water. The mom asks, “What’s in the envelope,” and then Clara mentions the unopened envelope, but inside the new envelope is a letter about Joe being able to play baseball with the St. Louis team and how that’s super exciting for them. They continue talking about the St. Louis baseball team, but Joe isn’t sure if he can play on the team because of his arm injury.
