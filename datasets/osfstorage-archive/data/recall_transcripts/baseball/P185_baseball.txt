So, the story begins while Joe and her sister are at home. Joe receives two different letters. The first letter is from a baseball coach for the Pistons that are interested in potentially taking him on to the team, but while he was reading them, his mom comes down from the outside - also it's winter - and he's excited and whips his hand back, but in the process of that, proceeds to knock over a glass and breaks it. His mom and his sister are extremely excited for the news. Then, as they're talking, his sister, Clara, mentions, “Oh, what about the other letter?” The other letter is from a girl named Mabel, saying that her and her brother are coming to visit today as they’re passing through for a trip. It seems that Joe is pretty interested in Mabel but they don't really go that in depth with it.  What else? It was winter when this all was happening. I think they were inside when they're reading the letters as well. Well, I mean they're inside, for all of them. His mom was just saying over and over again how happy she is for her son, and that his arm is their money - his money maker and - what else, what else, what else? He headed out, I think, to the station towards the very end of it. I think he is going to go pick up Mabel possibly.  What else?  I think that is quite literally all I remember. I think it was also about as much in-depth as I remember.  I mean, I'm done. Yes.   I'm done.
