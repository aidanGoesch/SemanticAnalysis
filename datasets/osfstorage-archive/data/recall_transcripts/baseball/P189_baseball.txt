The story starts off with Joe and Clara receiving a letter. Joe picks up the letter. Clara asked him who the letter was from and what the letter was about. If it was about something to do with their dad’s business. Joe to hold her no, that it had to do with him making money. Then, he proceeded to show her about his pitching arm because he said that the letter had to do with his future. While he was showing her his pitching arm, his mom got in his way and he knocked over a pitcher of water that she is carrying and he proceeded to tell her about the conversation that he and Clara were having and how he knocked over the pitcher of water.
Then, his mom asked him – no, no, no. Then, yes, his mom asked him about the contents of the letter and Clara asked him about the contents of the letter, because he was holding two letters. One that he had open was about him getting transferred to the Saint Louis major league baseball team. He was going to pitch for them and it seemed that he was on now was going to trade him. The letter was just stating that his coach, I think it was, would miss him but it would be great a great opportunity for him.  Yes, that’s it with that.
Then, he ended up opening the second letter and it was from an old friend that had said that they were coming to see them so he needed to go to the train station to pick them up but it was in the middle of a snowstorm. But that didn’t stop him, he still went to the train station to pick them up. When he got to the train station, he was just waiting there. Eventually, they told him that it didn’t make sense for him to continue waiting because the train wouldn’t have arrived that day because it was delayed due to the snow storm. It was trap in a five-foot snow. I don’t even remember, honestly.  Yes, trapped behind snow. He was like, “What can I do because I have friends on that train?”
That’s all I can remember, honestly.
