So, basically, the story was about a dad and about a son and it was about baseball. In the beginning, what I can recall was - let me try to remember.  There was a moment when they were talking. They were talking about the baseball league and how hard it was for them. It was just very difficult and he was motivating his son to go to join the baseball league. That’s honestly all I can remember right now. There was just a lot going on. I can’t remember the exact words but the main plot was about baseball and this father-son relationship. I believe at the end that the son was able to join. 
I can’t recall what else happened.  Okay. So then, I also remember there was a moment when the mom joined in and she was talking about how she really wants her son to play baseball as well and I think that was also very interesting. What else?  Basically, I think the moral was just that at this timeline, it was very difficult for people to join sports, especially baseball, so that’s pretty important.
