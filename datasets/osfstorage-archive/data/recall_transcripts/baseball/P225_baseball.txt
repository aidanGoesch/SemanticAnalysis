Okay. So, basically, there is the character named Joe and Clara Matterson, Masterson, and Joe gets home to their house - they’re siblings - and he has a letter. His sister wants to know what it is, but he won’t say yet. In the second act, the letter he gets is from the National Baseball League that he got a spot on the team. Then his mother comes in and she was holding a glass water pitcher to water the flowers in the  box, but Joe had hit the pitcher when he was swinging his arms like he was pitching in baseball. Then the water gets all over the place and his mother was  he’s going to ruin the carpet or something. Then he tells them that he was going to come with some money with the baseball team, that he had , but then he tells his mom that he’s being drafted into the team. His mom thinks he’s talking about drafted  choice, which is sort of true because he’s not typical yet to take offers from other teams once he gets a contract. Then something happened. They got a little bit confused about his friends are coming to visit. They don’t know where he is, but then there’s a snowstorm and they got snowed in, and they got stuck on the train. He tries to go get them  because the train is fully snowed. I’m done.    the time.   I can’t remember anymore the story.   I can’t remember anything else.   There’s Joe and Clara Matterson .
