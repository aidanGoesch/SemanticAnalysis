So, a narrator, she grew up around the Kennedys, no more than 20 miles from the Kennedy family. She recalled an event where in the car, there was a show, a radio show playing the anniversary about the death of President Kennedy, and she began crying, and her sister, I believe, made a comment, a snarky comment about her crying, to her parents, and her father pulled over and said, “Well, don't you ever be afraid to cry. Don't ever be ashamed or afraid to cry for that man.” She also recalled her aunts and how – well, actually before that, she recalled how her father bought the same jewels and got married in the same church to her - got married with - got married to her mother and gave her the same jewels and married her in the same church as Jack, JFK did with Jackie Kennedy, and then she recalled her aunts and how one of their favorite things to do for vacation was to go up by the Kennedy compound and they would place their chairs not towards the water or not towards anything else but actually towards the Kennedy compound, and what they would do is they would watch the Kennedys and they would just look to see activity going on in the Kennedy house, like who was leaving, who was staying, how many new people, and actually, the reason for pretty much the family’s, I guess, adoration for the Kennedys and their idea of the Kennedys as the center of their universe mainly stems from the fact that the Kennedys were Irish, the Kennedys were Catholic, but really, I guess, formed a bond between the - or maybe a bond from afar between the family and the Kennedys, and they consider themselves basically like the extended family that the Kennedys didn’t see because they were busy. So, the aunts would - when they saw someone knew, they would trace the family history and they would base time events after John - JFK’s death and to try to figure out who it was, and maybe they might determine it was Bobby's kid, and after that, they would just continue watching. They would mention, “Oh, you never see Jackie much here,” and they then might look at each other longingly, kind of knowingly, and – so, because all this going on, not much attention was being paid towards the children, going - swimming in the water, and so eventually they got pulled out by a riptide, and they could - they could eventually see the passengers of a ferry, the faces of the passengers of a ferry while seeing their aunts as just dots on the shore, and eventually they realized, “Well, yes, we're - we're far. We're far out from where we are supposed to be.” But eventually, they got saved, they got pulled out of the water by two Kennedy brothers and brought back to shore, and as she's being brought back to shore in the timeline of the story, she actually - I guess the narrator breaks down for us the personalities of her aunts. One of her aunts is kind of like a personality where she'll say something that might be nice or might sound like a compliment but actually just say it in a way that’s very aggressive or very negative; and another aunt, she will get so mad that the only thing that she’ll be able to say is somebody's – the full person's address. So, the narrator, as they're approaching, they're imagining what the Kennedy brothers might have known that they're in for, but what was unexpected was that the Kennedy brothers – was that the aunts pretended like everything was fine, they were smiling, acting normal, and then - but while they were acting like that, they were glaring at the - their nieces and nephews, daughters, sons, and kind of telling – kind of with a glance – glare, like “You're still in big trouble.” And so, after the Kennedys left, the aunts forbade them or forbid them from going into the water because they have no respect for the water, in the aunts’ words. So, they stayed on the shore but eventually they found that staying in the shore was boring, and so after whining and complaining, according to the narrator, the aunts’ finally said, “Okay, you can go knee-deep.” Knee-deep wasn’t interesting for them, so they – so, I guess they devised a game, and so they decided to play chicken fights. At first there was only the three of them until their uncle, who never normally joins them in games, decided to play with them, and as they're playing, the narrator accidentally kicks her uncle in the head with her foot, probably - yes, with her foot, and his eye comes out. So, in this chaos and panic, the narrator tells us this aunt went screaming because of how expensive the eye is, and that her cousins are pointing fingers and glaring at her because, in her words, in the narrator’s words, they think that she broke their father. So, in this chaos and strangeness, the narrator isn’t sure what to do, and so she kind of slinks off, and I guess, eventually is waiting in the water and then she finds the eye, and at first she screamed, she drops the eye, but this notifies the family that perhaps the eye can be found. And so, after a while, they were looking for the eye, and eventually, a male cousin finds the eye, and the fact that his father or her - her uncle, the narrator’s uncle is able to wash out the eye and put it back in, the magnetic eye, which is why it’s expensive, and after which, I guess things – she never thinks that it really returned to normal exactly, she's never fully integrated back to the family as far as we know in the time setting, time period of the story, but she does notice at the very end, the Kennedys, Kennedy brothers or Kennedys - two Kennedy people were watching her or watching their family commotion the whole time, and then she ended the story there, and
