The story begins with the speaker saying how she is from Providence, Rhode Island, and her family is a big fan of the Kennedy family. They lived near where the Kennedys were living there when they lived there and she went through many recounts of how her family kind of practiced their liking of the Kennedys. For example, her parents got married in the same church that the Kennedys did. Her father gave her mother kind of replica jewelry of what Jack Kennedy gave to Jackie Kennedy, and they - one summer, she was recalling a story how they were on a boat. They were kind of having fun on the boat and all the sudden the eye pops out of the head and, yes,  Thank you. [Pause] She was essentially saying how a lot of people in the town - she was in the car with her sister one day and her sister began crying. She recalled telling her dad saying, “Ha-ha-ha! My sister is crying.” The father pulled over on the Interstate 95 and said, “Never be afraid to cry about that man.” This all just shows how much they really love the Kennedy family and the Kennedys in Connecticut.
