Okay. Basically, there was this woman, her name is Mikayla. Mikayla’s family lives right across the Kennedys. The Kennedys and them literally did everything the same. Her dad bought the same replica jewelry for the mom. Basically, they did everything together. Then, she has an aunt named Momo, and she has a lot of aunts and uncles she talks about. She talks about them being on a boat then being on the ocean, and when they were on the ocean, they get in trouble, and their aunt tells them, “You’re not allowed to go in the ocean anymore.” They’re upset, and the aunt is like, “Okay, you can put your knees in,” and they’re like “Okay.” And they go in and they’re like, “This is so boring,” and then they go ahead and have a chicken fight. Basically, the chicken fight was very boring for them because there were only three people, so “It’s kind of weird” is what she said, I think. Then, on accident, Mikayla kicks her uncle. Basically, he has his eye that’s fake, and it moves with his real eye, it - literally, they paid so much money for it. Everyone’s crying and pointing at Mikayla. Mikayla feels awful and wishes that the Kennedys did not save her from – on the boat. What she is upset about is that she wishes that they didn’t save her, because they helped saved her. She also feels like she – there were people laughing in the back while she was telling the story, she’s talking about her childhood. They also talked about Jack and Rose, to see how old Jack and Rose were. Basically, Jack passed away. They calculated that Rose is 85 years old. They feel like – sorry. The aunt is really mad because she feels like they spent so much money getting the fake eye for the uncle, and then they go to see him without the eye and they see skin, they see a hole in his eye. And basically, they also have the same problems as the Kennedys do. They’re Catholic, they also go to church on Saturdays. I think that’s all I remember.  [Pause] I’m not sure how to do this.
