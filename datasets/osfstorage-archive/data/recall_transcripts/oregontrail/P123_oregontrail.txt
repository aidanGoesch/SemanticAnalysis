So, what I remember was there’s this teacher, she wanted to teach her students the Oregon Trail. She goes into the classroom the next day. Then she also played a game to go to Oregon City something. I don’t know what it is. She wants to go to Oregon City and then [Pause] the students have been given names, names of people who have gone to Oregon City but have died and they make up their own last names, I think. I’m not sure. Then they played the game and then this kid almost dies. I’m not sure if it’s in real life or in the game. They also brought a doctor with them in case they needed any help. The kid rolls a three on a dice or something. They continued playing the game and then it’s sort of like they still have 720 miles to Oregon City. The teacher will say that it’s going to take a long time to go and then she was like, “Oh, I don’t want to do this.” She was saying stuff like that. She was saying stuff like “How long this is going to take?” Stuff like that. That’s what I basically learned. To summarize what they do, it’s play the game, choose the names, then what they do is play the game. That takes a while, 720 miles, rolled three. It takes a lot of time. That’s what I remember. There’s a teacher. I’m very tired. Doesn’t like this – wow. She’s a teacher, asked stuff. [Pause] That’s what I basically remember. [Pause] That’s what I basically remember about that. [Pause] I’m done.
