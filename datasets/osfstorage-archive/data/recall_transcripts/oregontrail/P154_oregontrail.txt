So, this is a story of a teacher who had an Oregon Trail experience with his students, his nine-year old students. So, basically this was supposed to be a type of in-class trail experience with the students which basically began with the stories that she wrote and then assigning the character to each student which are typically supposed to be called an Oregon Trail experience. There were a series of events that happened on the way to the events amongst which was one other classmate almost dying, Katie. Then she ended up getting rescued by another of her classmate. Then the second incident was when they saw an ailing animal that they needed to adopt. 
Then, another incident that occurred earlier on was they had to buy a snake jar from a snake man sort of type of buying time so that they could get to the final destination in record time. That’s how the whole story unfolded. It happened that the students were more interested in the bad, on the outcome overall from the Oregon Trail experience. However, the teacher was smart enough not to have a bad ending for anybody. I think that’s what, basically, all about the Oregon Trail experience that the teacher narrated. Thank you. I’m done.
