I will do my best to complete at least close to four minutes, which I doubt I’ll be able to, but I think I can give a pretty high-level summary of the story of a teacher in New York City that wanted to impress upon her class a certain kind of existence that they may have not been familiar with. It was surrounded by a story of explorers and to help illustrate the stories, she took the class on a type of field trip with the expectation of giving them what a 40-mile trek across landscape would be like. She had mentioned two kids. One was a boy who was kind of like the class jester. He challenged her on a couple of points first during the class of it being a dangerous adventure as well as during the field trip in place of doing like this Oregon trek through the mountains. They went down past a stream in the state of New York in New York City. While on the trail, a girl asked for a sip of water, and the boy, he had mentioned something about the water as well. Luckily, there was a water fountain, so she kind of blessed it in a way to turn it from a normal water fountain that they were used to in their existence to the flowing stream and it’s okay to partake to quench the thirst. 
Then, the conclusion of the story was she ran into the little girl and she had mentioned she looked the same but she is just stretched out. The little girl immediately brought to her attention that dangerous exploration that they went through while she was her teacher. The teacher, who I don’t remember her name, mentioned that, “Heck, yes, I do.” So, overall, it was an intriguing story, and it looks like I have about a minute to go before the green turns to yellow. I can say I am done and press the letter D. Please allow this moment of silence. [Pause]
