As a third-grade teacher I’m trying to teach the kids about the Oregon Trail, and I try to do it in many shapes and forms, by using puppets, and stuffed animals and such. I try to make it as fun as possible. So, I get the kids all excited about learning about the Oregon Trail, and each one plays a part. As practicing for the long trail, we take a 40-block walk to get in shape for a long Oregon Trail walk. One kid, Alex, says, “But you don't walk on the Oregon Trail, you ride in wagon trains,” and I said, “Oh no, children do not ride in the wagon train, it’s only adults do. These children walk.” So, we continue to talk about the Oregon Trail and things that the people did. There were farmers and all types of people that was on this trail. So, we continued to walk, and Alex is always asking the questions, he says, “Well, what if someone dies on this trail?” and I’m not quite - I didn't expect anyone to die on this trail, but it is a possibility. So, I asked the students if they had ever played the Oregon Trail game, or video, and one person raised her hand and said yes, she has. So, just like in a game, you roll the dice, and you may move forward several miles on the trail, or you may encounter difficulties, like sickness. One person becomes sick, and one person gets run over by the wagon. The students asked, “What happens if we come upon wild animals?” I did not anticipate to come upon wild animals, but it is possible. So, one student rolls the dice, and it came up on a wolf, and so they encountered a wolf on the trail.
