So, basically, it was this lady talking about how she’s a teacher for third graders and how she teaches them a class and she basically talks about funny stuff. It’s just very interesting because she’s making jokes and she’s talking about how her third graders would act in class and then I thought it was really funny. Overall, she was just talking about her experiences. Yes.  I’m just trying to remember what else she talked about.
She talked about a lot of stuff, but mainly, one time, her kids would stand in line, the third graders, and something happened with that. I thought that was pretty interesting. That’s all I can really remember.  Yes, that’s it.   Wait. Actually, I remember that she was talking about one of her kids specifically and how energetic they were. I thought that was pretty interesting. That’s the only thing I could really recall from the story.
