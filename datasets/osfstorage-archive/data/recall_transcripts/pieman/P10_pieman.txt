Okay, so the story began with a man - I don't remember his name but he was like - I don't know. Basically, he found out that Dean McGowan of Fordham University was going to raise inflation on the students, and I don't remember how he met up with him but he found him and started ridiculing him or ask him why he was going to raise inflation. Then this man apparently appeared with the cream pie and shoved it in Dean McGowan’s face and then ran away. Then the speaker asked the dean how he felt about it and he said, “F you.” Then the guy proceeds to go home and he says to himself that it's a good story but it needs embellishing, so he goes home and he writes about the encounter with the dean and the guy who threw the cream pie, but he changes the story by saying the guy who threw the cream pie was now a superhero named Pie Man, PM for short. He said a Latin catchphrase like “I am not an animal” or something like that. Then he said that he wore a cape and stuff, and then he took the story - I guess he’s an editor for a newspaper or something, and then he took the story to his chief editor, something like that. He says, “Wow, this is a great story. I’m printing it on page one.” Then his story comes out and I guess everybody likes it. Then he met with someone at a hotel, I don't remember much about that part of the story, like a childhood friend or something. I don't remember that part, but then he writes I think five more stories or he continues to write them. Then he goes to a bar one night and meets a girl named Amanda I believe, and he has a crush on her or he says like they were flirting, but then he said he was actually the only one flirting with her. She says, “It’s really strange how you know where Pie Man is at all times. Are you Pie Man?” He goes, “If I say yes, she'll have sex with me,” so he tells himself he basically is Pie Man because he created him. He invented him, so he tells her yes, and that's all I remember.
