Jim had shared something about the dean was going to like raise the prices of tuition and he didn’t think that that was fair for the students who were like poor. Then he was arguing with the dean and he called him a name, and then somebody came and smashed a pie in his face, and then he went to the newspaper of the school and asked if he can do a story on it. He made up a character called Pie Man. He gave him a catchphrase and he put it in the newspaper, and then people loved it. Then the person who pied the dean reached out to him and told him who he was going to pie next, which is Sheila, a girl who is really close with the dean and she wanted to ban drinking beer outside of the school, so she got pied as well. He put that in the newspaper along with the picture of Pie Man with his cape and he said his catchphrase again. Then Jim went to a bar and he saw this girl, Angela, that was in one of his classes, that he flirted with her a lot. She came up to him and asked if he was Pie Man because he always seemed like he knew where Pie Man was going to be every time. Even thought he isn’t Pie Man, he lied and said that he was Pie Man because he essentially made up Pie Man. Everybody knew of Pie Man because of him so he figured that he would say he was Pie Man. Then she seemed very happy about it and she asked him to buy her a beer. She said to tell her more about Pie Man and they sat down and talked, and have a drink.
