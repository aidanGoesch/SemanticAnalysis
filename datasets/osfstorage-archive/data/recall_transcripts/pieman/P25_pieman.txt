So, in the story, Jim, he’s an upcoming journalist in Fordham University and he meets the dean,  something. He talks to him about something that was going on with the university and he asked his opinion on it, and the dean said to back off. Then, suddenly, a man threw a cream pie at the dean. He asked him to report his reaction on it and he curses at him. Then Jim takes this to the head of what he's working on, Journalism, and he tells him the story, and the guy let’s him publish his story. In Journalism, he says, reporters make stuff up which is what he did. He gave the man who threw the pie at the dean a name, Pie Man, and he gave him some words in Latin that refers to “I’m not an animal.” He does all of that and the next day, he gets a letter of the Pie Man. He says he’s going to do it again and his target was Sheila. There are rumors that she has something with the dean and that she, with the dean, banned alcohol from coming to the school. So, she was the target and he targeted him and then he kept writing that five more times. Then time has passed and he was at a bar. He talks about how he liked this girl, Angela. How he flirted with her and all that, and then the girl tapped him, I believe, in the shoulder and asked him if he was Pie Man. The first thing he said, he said that - he’s so happy. He was thinking about saying yes or no. He said, yes, he was because he would get sex from her. Then, in his idea, he did bring up Pie Man because he gave Pie Man his name and yes. He also said how - [Pause] oh, so I think that it was a senior who is the head of the Department of Journalism which he was in, yes. [Pause] I’m done. [Pause] I think there was… [Pause] I’m done.
