The narrator is a reporter for The Rams, I guess, at Fordham University, and he was speaking to the dean, and he was asking him to comment about inflation. I don’t know if he said, “Listen, punk. Listen here, punk,” or something, and then someone came in and – well, a man came in or someone came in, and they put pie in his face. They slapped pie into the face of the dean, and then the narrator asked, “Can you comment on this attack with the pie?” and he cursed at him or cussed. Now, I think also, I remember someone named Sheila was collaborated with the dean and appropriate or – well, not appropriate ways, and also, with work and stuff. I don’t know. I also know that Sheila was – she didn’t like drinking in public. Also, the narrator, he talked about how there was this girl that he liked. I think he was flirting with her or something, and he wasn’t sure. No, sorry. He felt that he was the one who was doing the flirting or doing – liked her more than he did – or she did, sorry. And she didn’t know about it. Yes. The girl, Sheila. I mean, not Sheila. I don’t know. [Laughter] The girl he liked asked him. The girl he liked asked him, “Oh.” I mean, told him, “Why?” Well, asked him, “Why is it that you know where this person – where the dean is at any time?” or something like that, and was asking if he was the Pie Man. Oh, also, I’m thinking. I just forgot. [Pause] Oh, he was talking about a cape or something, maybe the Pie Man wore a cape or something, or I don’t know, and then there was this Latin thing he said and it meant, “I’m not a monster.” or something like that, and yes. Then, the narrator told the girl he liked that he was the Pie Man when she asked, and yes. Whatever. Yes, I’m done.
