The narrator of the story was a newspaper writer for the Fordham University paper and he was asked to - or he had a conversation with the dean of Fordham because the dean wanted to reduce the amount of low income students on campus and replace them with wealthier students. In the end of this conversation, Pie Man came and pied the dean. Then, the narrator was tasked with writing a story about Pie Man. Then, Pie Man became somewhat of a sensation on campus, but obviously, he was in disguise so no one knew who Pie Man was and there was – the narrator was tasked with writing five stories about Pie Man and each of those five stories were hits. Then, the story transitioned to talking about how there was this girl from the narrator’s class and he saw – he had been flirting with her for a long time, but he wasn’t sure if she’s getting the message. So, then he went to a bar and he saw that girl there, and she asked him right blatantly is he was Pie Man, and he knew that - he thought that if he told her yes, she’d sleep with him. Then, obviously, the narrator knew that the right thing to do would be to say that he wasn’t Pie Man because he had never seen Pie Man out of costume. He didn’t know his true identity, but he obviously wanted the girl’s affection. So, he lied to her and said that he was Pie Man. She told him, “Okay. Now, you can buy me – now you have to buy me a drink.” Then, the Pie Man was pieing people with pie and whipped cream. Then, there was point in the beginning of the story when the narrator asked the dean when he talked about the pie experience. Then, the dean told the narrator to fuck off or something. Then, what else? The narrator also talked about how he embellished the story to make it more dramatic and more entertaining for the audience. There was also another girl that was mentioned in the story and the narrator implies that she had been sleeping with the dean.
