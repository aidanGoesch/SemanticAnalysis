So, basically what happened was that this guy was writing for the paper, for The Ram. He was writing a story about how this guy, Dean McIver at Fordham University, wanted to basically get rid of all the working-class people and bring in higher-end people so he decided to raise the tuition. Now, this guy went to, I think it was like a conference or something, and then basically one of these guys, a random guy, ran up the dean and threw a pie in his face. Then, the reporter asked him, “So, how do you feel about this recent attack?” Then, the whole crowd laughed. He decided to go home and write about it and he called the guy that threw the pie in the guy’s face, he called and Pie Man, with a capital P and a capital M. He said that he was like an Avenger.
Now, the story got pretty popular and I think people started reading it around. Then, there was this student body president that made a no-drinking on campus law, and he said that she was probably doing some stuff in the dean’s office. Then, yes, I guess the stories got pretty popular and he started publishing more and more stories about Pie Man. He had a catchphrase in Latin. I don’t recall the exact catchphrase because I don’t speak Latin. Even though he translated it, I don’t remember. Then, there was this girl that he flirted with and she didn’t flirt back with him. She went up to him or he went up to her and she asked if he was Pie Man, and he said yes. Then, she told him to buy him a beer and to go talk about how it was like being Pie Man.
That’s all I recall. Sorry it wasn’t four minutes long but that’s a long time to speak because I am not good at talking for a long time.    Okay. I guess I’ll wait.
