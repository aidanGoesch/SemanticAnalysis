Oh, God. I don’t know half of what he said. At the beginning, he’s talking about how he went to Fordham and he was a journalist for The Ram, the school newspaper and they were raising tuition beyond inflation because they wanted more prestige or they wanted a higher average socioeconomic status for students or something, that kind of vibe. He sees the dean and he goes up to the dean to get a quote on the situation, and then the dean said, “Hey, punk,” or something and then got pied in the face with a pie crust tin thing filled with cream. Then, I think he left without cleaning off. Oh, the dude, the journalist dude was like, “Oh, can I get quote on that?” or something as a joke and the dean left, I think. They were talking about anything that happened after that except – oh, I think it was the student body told or like thought it was the dude talking to the dean who pied him. So, he started calling him Pie Man and this girl started talking to him and calling him Pie Man, and he slept with him. I remember he just listened. It’s how I - I don’t remember literally anything except for the very beginning.  All right. No? Okay. I have to keep talking until time has passed. [Pause] I got the vibe he was in the Bronx campus, but I could be wrong. When that girl started messaging him, calling him Pie Man, I think the Pie Man are both . Was it a girl? His voice was very soothing, and then I’m focusing a lot on his voice instead of the content [Laughter] of the story. Let’s see what else. [Pause] He was studying journalism, I believe. Oh, and then there’s someone who won a Pulitzer Prize. I don’t remember. I don’t remember how that context fits in the story, but I think he was very nice that he won the Pulitzer Prize. I think he’s just super good at journalism. Okay. Four minutes. It’s still going. Suddenly, the green circle turned yellow. There’s two minutes that passed. Oh.
