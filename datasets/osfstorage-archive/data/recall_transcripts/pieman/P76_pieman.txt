So, this man, he starts his journalism career in Fordham University and Fordham University decides to raise the tuitions. At an event, the man goes to the dean and ask him why they're going to raise the tuition of the university, how it goes against their mission. All of a sudden, there is a guy who has a pie in his hand and he pies the dean in his face. When the journalist asked the dean how he feels about the tuition increase, he tells him to fuck off and then he goes away. Then it cuts to when the journalist goes back to his office and he knows he has a good story and he's writing and developing his story. The Pie Man sends him a note and tells him that if he wants to see more of what he did to the dean that to meet him at Duane Library. So, the journalist meets him at Duane library and he sees a girl that the dean is close to. I think her name is Sheila or something. She seems to be really close and suggestive with the dean and he wants people like her to be in the school. People more proper, and something about not drinking outside of campus, to ban drinking altogether. Then I think it cuts to when the journalist goes to a bar and he sees this girl that he’d been flirting with for a while. He just tells his experience with her and she comes up to him and is like, “You're always around when the Pie Man is around. Are you the Pie Man?” He thinks for a second and he's like, “Well, if I say yes, she's going to have sex with me.” So, he tells her that he is indeed the Pie Man.  Yes, he tells the girl that he's the Pie Man and then she tells him to buy her drink and then the story ends.
