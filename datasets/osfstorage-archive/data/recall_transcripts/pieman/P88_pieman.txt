The speaker is from Queens and he had a job as a news reporter at Fordham University. He was at an event where someone named Dean was and he interviewed him. Right at that moment, someone came up very fast and no one really saw who it was and he shoved a pie in this man's face. This man was not very happy and the speaker, as a reporter, he said, “Do you have any comments for this attack?” The Dean guy said, “Fuck you,” and then he left. So, the speaker made that into a story and slightly fabricated the portrayal of Pie Man, which is the name that he gave to this mystery person that came and pied this man in the face. He received a note, I do not remember how, that it's signed from Pie Man, saying that he will meet him somewhere at a certain time to show him what he does. I forgot his promise.
So, he shows up there the next day with a photographer and he sees this class president of Fordham who had been thought of to have slept with this Dean guy. So, Pie Man ran up just as he did before and pied her in the face and – I’m losing it. Let me…  Oh, yes. After this accident, Pie Man becomes a figure on campus and people start saying his things and dressing up as him. Specifically, the illustration of Pie Man wore a cape and he was depicted as a superhero. Then when the speaker goes out to a bar, he sees this girl that he had been flirting with even though he might not have been getting it reciprocated. She was there and she saw him. She came up to him and asked if he was Pie Man because he always knows where Pie Man is going to be and where he's going to be. He said yes even though he knew that he was lying about it.  I think she believed him and showed him to her friends, but I do not remember the rest of the ending.
