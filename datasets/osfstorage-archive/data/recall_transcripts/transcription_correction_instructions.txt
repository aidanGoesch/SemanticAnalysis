overview:
1. each folder is a subject, containing 1-2 audio files and the associated transcripts. The order of the audio files is the same as the order of the transcripts (i.e., transcript0 is the first audio file; transcript1 is the second).
2. the audio files are always about two stories, called "pie man" and "eyespy". The order of the two stories are random within a subject.

instructions:

1. modify the transcripts according to the audio files. 
2. Omit filler words such as "um", "oh"
3. Keep only one if a word is repeated in a row such as "and and" 
4. remove "I am done" at the end of the transcript, if it exists
5. Make sure the proper nouns are correct:
6. spell out numbers (e.g. "eighty five", not "85")
7. letter case does not matter. punctuation does not matter, but try to keep apostrophes.
