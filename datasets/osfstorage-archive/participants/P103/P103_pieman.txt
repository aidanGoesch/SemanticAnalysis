So, this individual was at Fordham University. He wrote for the Ram Newspaper. One day, he was walking, and he saw the dean of Fordham walk out of the building. This individual is a reporter, understood that the dean wanted to replace Fordham’s middle-class students with wealthier ones by raising the tuition. So, he asks the dean this question about raising the tuition and that this betrays the institution’s beliefs and values. As the dean is getting ready to respond, someone mashes a cream pie in the dean’s face and then runs away. So, the dean is covered with the cream pie following the previous incident. The individual asks the dean if he wants to comment on the attack, but says no. So, this individual who is writing the story goes to the newsroom. At some point, he encounters the editor-in-chief who’s going to win a Pulitzer Prize at some point in his life. He ends up writing the story by adding elements of embellishment. So, he makes things up throughout the story and he knows that this isn’t journalistically okay, but he does it. He called Pie Man a different name, and he said that as he fled the scene, he clicked his heels and gave him a catchphrase to say, something along the lines of how he’s not an animal. The story ends up going on page one, which he said was one of the first kind of mistakes. I’m having a little bit of trouble remembering the rest of the story. I do know that there was a student body president at one point that came out. This individual is really against outdoor drinking in campus and was really just opposed of drinking in general and in public. He asked this or the student body president, Sheila, I believe is what the name was, asked the student body president if he was Pie Man. He knew that if he said yes, that she would have sex with him. That’s all I remember. So, I’m done.
