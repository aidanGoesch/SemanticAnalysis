There were two children, they were brother and sister and the brother was into playing baseball and he wanted to be a professional baseball player. The little sister and him would use different slang words related to baseball and the brother would make fun of the little sister because of the slang that she would use, and then they went to a baseball game for the brother and they were cheering him on and he did good. He started getting some letters in the mail for him to go to different places to play baseball. One of them was to go to St. Louis and the mom was worried because the son said he was supposed to be deployed to St. Louis and the mom was saying that deployed used to mean going to war back in the day, so it's strange that they would say deployed like that St. Louis and then he thought that he was - would be able to move up to different places that he wants to play baseball at if he goes to play in St. Louis, and he ended up going to St. Louis and there was a snowstorm and some of his friends were stuck on the train, I believe, and so he was trying to figure out how he could help them out of the train. He was trying to figure out ideas how to do that. It seemed like the brother and sister had a good relationship with each other and they would make jokes with each other and it seems like the sister supported the brother with his baseball career and she was very happy for him. Yes, that's all I can remember.  I’m trying to remember something else. [Pause] The brother would get some mail in about different leagues he can play in and he was having trouble figuring out which ones he wanted to do as well. I don’t think the mom wanted him to go to St. Louis, so he was having trouble with that figuring out if he should go or not. They didn't say how old they were, so I'm not sure how old they were.
