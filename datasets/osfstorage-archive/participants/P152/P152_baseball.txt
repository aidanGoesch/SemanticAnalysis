Okay. The narrator of the story is a male. He’s talking in first person. It’s a boy named Joe and his sister, Clara. Joe is a baseball player. Clara was upset with him that he left the baseball league but Joe insisted that he was going – he was talking about extra money that he was going to make. Clara wondered what he meant by that. Their mother’s Missus Maddison. Water got spilt on the floor and Joe, Clara told Joe that you should get the mop to mop up the water. Joe mopped up the water. Joe at a point revealed what the extra money was going to be that he was going to make money based on his pitching arm. He informed his mother and sister Clara that he was pretty sure that he was going to be drafted to the St. Louis Nationals.
There was an unopened envelope on the floor that Joe picked up. Clara and his mom were curious who the letter was from. Joe consistently called his mom, mumsy. The letter he then opened, and the letter was from actually Mabel and brother Reggie. They were letting them know in the letter that they were coming to stay. So, Joe found out in the letter that they were going to be at the train station so he was going to go down to the train station and meet them there. 
Reggie apparently has business in town and that’s why they were coming. So, Joe asked Clara if she wanted to go down with him. She said no, and that she would stay. So, he went down to that train station on his own to see Mabel and Reggie when they arrived. However, when he got to the train station, he was informed that the train was not coming. Joe was concerned that, was it in a wreck? A person working at the train station said no, not a wreck but they were snowed in at a particular location and they could not depart.
