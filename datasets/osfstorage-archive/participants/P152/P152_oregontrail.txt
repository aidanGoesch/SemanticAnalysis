Okay, the narrator in this story is a female teacher. She teaches third graders, nine-year-olds. She's at a point in the school year where she's going to be teaching about the Oregon Trail. There's a particular boy in the class named Alex that is a smart alec. There were some funny moments with him during the classes, but the girls also want to be pop stars, but unfortunately, they cannot. They're going to be taking on characters to try to experience what the Oregon Trail was like. The teacher took the students on a 40-block walk in Manhattan. Then as far as the game, what she did is she combined the Oregon Trail videogame with the Dungeons & Dragons game. So, basically, each day in the class, the kids, they rolled dice to determine their fate on the Oregon Trail.  [Pause] Unfortunately, I cannot recall any more of the story. I summarized it. [Laughter] [Pause]
