This social studies teacher plays games with her class in order to help them understand the history lessons better. The teacher was doing a lesson on the Oregon Trail and she did it sort of like a Dungeons & Dragons style game where you would roll dice to see what happens in certain situations and they had to - the students had to decide what they did for a living. Some were farmers, some were doctors, this kind of thing. Because at first, all of the females in the class wanted to be popstars but that wasn't - there weren't pop stars on the Oregon Trail. So, they went ahead and started playing the game and one of the girls ends up being stuck - or no, first, they run into a snake oil salesman and the students don't know what a snake oil salesman is, but they buy the oil or whatever it was the salesman was selling in order to - because the salesman claims that it's going to get them to Oregon faster and they end up instead getting sick off of whatever was sold to them and they lose a day of travel. 
Then there's another situation where one of the girls in the classroom is stuck underneath one of the wagons on the Oregon Trail and they have to roll to see if she is going to make it or if she will die and things are not going well. Then there’s a - one of these other students, who’s a doctor, speaks up and then girl doesn't end up dying due to her roll because she didn't roll a six, she rolled a three. 
Let’s see. After that, the kids were very happy and cheered and were hugging each other and the teacher ran into that girl that got stuck under the wagon later, as she was in ninth grade, I think, and she looked roughly the same, just taller and the student asked the teacher if she remembered her being - almost dying on the Oregon Trail and the teacher said that she did.
