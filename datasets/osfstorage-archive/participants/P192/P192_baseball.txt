So, in the beginning, the brother was whistling and then there's something about a letter. He looked at the letters and the sister asks if there was any more in trouble. The brother said, “No, it’s not trouble,” but it's really important for him. Then, the sister brought up sport, the word sport, and then the brother – so all the guys said it was like a slang. Then that’s the first time that she heard other girls say it, “That’s not a slang.” Then they start talking about baseball and something about water getting spilled on a carpet and ruining the carpet, and then  they were talking about more baseball and the other letter. The older guy came out and asks about the other letter. Then the brother said that he’s going to be playing for a major league team for baseball. He said that it was really big.  Then there was someone coming to visit. There was someone coming to visit and then he says that she never met them before, but they’re coming through and they might stop by, but they’re not really sure. Then there was like something happening with the train. That guy was asking what happened to the train  or something, and they’re kind of suspicious that it’s getting stalled by a snowstorm.  The guy’s name was – it starts with J, I think, and then…  He said he has a friend on that train and then he asks if there’s anything he can do to help. .  Yes, I think I’m done.
