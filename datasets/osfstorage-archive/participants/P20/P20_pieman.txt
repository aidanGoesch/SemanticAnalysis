There was a guy who was a journalism major at Fordham University. He went to go visit Dean McGowan in his office when someone came in and threw a cream pie in his face and ran out of the room. Then, the journalism major took or went to - I forgot his name - went to the guy to write the story because the other guy said that Dean McGowan was a dick, or an asshole, and to write a story. So, the one writing the story embellished it a little bit which he said meant making shit up, which was crossing a line, but he crossed that line. He said that pier’s name was Pie Man and he wore a long flowy cape and a mask. When he was done pieing Dean McGowan, he jumped and clicked his heels. The journalism guy loved his paper or loved his story so he printed it on page one of the newspaper. Then, he was talking about Sheila. Sheila was born and bred well. She was a good student, but she was also known to be on Dean McGowan's desk a lot. She was the type of student to be on his desk a lot, and she petitioned for a rule to stop drinking. No beer at barbecues, to stop drinking publicly on campus. Then, Pie Man came and struck again and said his catchphrase in Latin, “I am not an animal,” and then went off and the journalism guy wrote five more stories in the school paper about Pie Man. One night when he went to a bar, he saw the girl, Angela, who he’d been flirting with in class a lot but it was more him flirting with her and he didn't know if she even knew he existed. Angela came up and asked him or said to him that he always knew when Pie Man was going to strike and then asked if he was Pie Man. He said or he thought about how she would definitely sleep with him if he was Pie Man. He said, in essence, he was Pie Man because or he thought that in essence, he was Pie Man because he brought Pie Man into existence, even though he never met Pie Man before and only had seen him in costume. So, he said, “Yes, I am pie man,” and then Angela said, “Okay. Buy me a drink.”
