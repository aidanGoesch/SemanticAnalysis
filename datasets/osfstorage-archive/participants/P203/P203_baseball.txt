All right. So, the story is about a boy named Joe and his sister, Clara. It starts off with the day I believe he said it was snowing outside. He received a letter in the mail. He's reading it. He has some sort of like I guess surprised reaction on his face. Clara was like, “Oh, what is that letter about?” He doesn't give much detail. She says, “Oh, is it something about Dad like something he did or something?” He was like, “Oh, no. It’s not about that.” But he doesn't mention what it's about. He just says something about baseball. So, Clara assumes that it's something bad and like he didn't make the team, or he got called off or something. So, Joe doesn't mention anything about if that's true, if it's not true. So, she's just saying that. So, yes. So, later, he starts practicing baseball on the carpet and she’s saying how it's going to ruin the carpet and all this stuff about him like practicing inside. We find out that the letter is not saying that he didn't make the team, but rather that a major league baseball team wants to recruit him. His mom hears this and says, “Recruit him? Oh, that sounds like something in wartime how they would call men to come serve for our country unwillingly.” Yes. I can't really remember much else about – Oh, the ending, something happened on a car or like a bus. Joe was saying how he knew someone on that bus, and they were going to go help him. That's how it ended. There was a lot of just minor details that I can’t really recall. Let’s see. Oh, the team was Saint Louis that was recruiting him. Yes. That's really the only thing I can remember. So, I'll just wait for the time to go down.
