So, the story begins by a third-grade teacher talking about her experience teaching the Oregon Trail. She recognizes that it’s a very serious and complicated time in history, and feels that her students will have trouble taking in perspective of people in the past. So, she begins to tell the story how it is a dangerous game and which people will die, and they would experience the real history of the Oregon Trail. So, the teacher prints real names of people who died on the Oregon Trail and she also creates occupations for them, meaning they’re doctors or farmers. So then, she makes it into a game where they do stuff, like even walking 40 blocks down in Manhattan, or they play a dangerous game of chance. Since the teacher was part of it, she was really into her character. The idea that someone might die really gets them excited to go into the Social Studies class. She calls her game a hit, but the students are very questionable about this, and ask like, “Is someone going to die today?” Meaning, that they are really interested in, I guess, the idea of survival. So, the teacher finds that the possibilities of them rolling the dice is very dangerous. Of course, she doesn’t want to get in trouble, but she feels that through her experiences - she remembers a specific event where the students are very engaged, specifically, a girl who becomes a doctor in the game and saves the life of - I believe the student’s name is Katie. The teacher keeps recalling events, but in the end, she shares a story of where she runs into Katie, the doctor - no, no, no, the one who got killed - who almost got killed, and she sees her years later on Broadway, and Katie remembers her experience in the third-grade class, and the teacher shares this with the audience.
