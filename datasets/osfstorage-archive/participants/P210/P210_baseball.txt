Joe goes to pick up the mail from the mailbox and there are two envelopes. One of them he opens and reads alongside his sister Clara. It is about his - he's like taken out of the, I believe, minor league team in Pittsburgh where he is, where he lives. He is upset by it. More Clara is upset by it. She like defends her brother in that way. Then they mess around a bit and Joe is swinging around showing how good of a batter he is. His mother comes out of a room. They're in their house with - she's holding a jug of water. She was going to water flowers with on the window box. However, Joe while swinging knocks the water out of her hands and makes a mess and then obviously her mother - the mother is upset, but then they explained the situation. Then Joe further reads the letter and he learns that he is being drafted to a major league team in St. Louis, Missouri. His mother is concerned due to the freezing draft because she is reminded of how men were drafted for the war and that Joe does not have a say in this. However, Joe agrees but he says along the lines of how the system is not great but in order to get the teams working as smoothly as possible, it needs to be that way. He explains how he will make more money in St. Louis on the major league team than staying in Pittsburg. He then opens the letter, the second letter, the one unopened and it’s from another female character, I don’t remember the name. She and another male character are coming by Pittsburg because of the trip they’re on, they’re not going to stay long, only about a day. Clara had never met them before for whatever reason, but Joe is decently excited. Then there was something about an express train and how it got snowed in due to the weather, and that it's stopping the train in its tracks and that Joe wants to do what he can to help.
