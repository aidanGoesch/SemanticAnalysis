It started off with the Kennedys and how she lives in Long Island. They’re very similar to the Kennedys in the sense that they’re both Catholic and both Irish. So, she talked about crying for the Kennedy’s I think like 10th anniversary and the dad was like, “Don’t ever be afraid to cry and let it all out.” Then she went into, I believe, a story about one of her uncles and how he pretty much had like a fake eye and that fake eye sort of came out of its socket. At first, they thought was real and they all started freaking out about it, but then they realized that it actually was a fake eye. But, yes, she also kind of like got into detail about like them being at the beach and those times with her aunts and just like hanging out at the beach so yes. I’m done. [Pause] Rachel .
