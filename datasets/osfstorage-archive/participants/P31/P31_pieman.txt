The story starts off with a guy named Jim, and he’s a journalist from the Bronx. He goes up to his dean. He was talking to his dean and whatever, and the dean is not a very good person. This guy comes in, and he just smashes the dean in the face with a pie. Everyone was like, “What is happening?” When the guy, Jim, asks for a quote for his journal, the dean is like, “Go fuck yourself.” Jim takes this story to the editor of The Rams, which is the newspaper article. He’s a senior. He reads the story, and he’s like, “Oh, yes. This dean’s a dick. Let’s publish it. It’s going to be on first page,” but Jim over-exaggerates the story saying he was wearing this cape, like a superhero without a cape or whatever, and said he had this Latin catchphrase which meant something about being an animal. Once he had written the story, Pie Man had gotten in contact with him. He was like, “Listen, bro, I’m going to be at the library at 3:00 on Tuesday. Come, and I’m going to pie face this girl, Sheila. Sheila was the vice president or the president of the university, and she was getting frisky with the dean, but don’t tell anyone because that’s gossip,” and asked to stay in just this room. He’s outside the library, and he has this photographer with him. He snaps a picture of the girl getting pied in the face, and he says his catchphrase, at least that’s what Jim says in his article. Then, Jim’s at a bar, and he sees this girl, Angela. He really likes Angela and really fancies Angela, and he flirts with Angela a lot, but he doesn’t – but Angela doesn’t flirt back with him. It’s a one-way kind of thing, and then after all this press he’s getting from the articles he’s writing about Pie Man, Angela goes up to him, and she’s like, “Are you Pie Man?” He was thinking, “Whoa, if I say yes, then this girl is going to have sex with me.” He thinks about it, and he ultimately says, “Yes,” and Angela says, “Good. Now, buy me a beer.” That’s it.
