So, Jim, he goes to Fordham University and he's a journalist. He is interviewing the dean about student rates about middle-class to upper-class families and expenses at Fordham University. While he's interviewing the dean, someone comes up and smashes the dean in the face with a cream pie. He's like, “Oh my gosh, that was so funny,” and he wants to write a story on it. So, he begins writing the story on it and he goes to Duane library and runs into a girl there. She talks to him about the story and Pie Man which was the dean and then the dean comes out of nowhere, start saying some phrase, and he finds it funny and she finds it funny.

So then, his story gets published, everybody reads a story everybody loves the story and so is the dean.

I saw your story on Pie Man.” He’s like, “Yes, yes. You know?”  She’s like, “So, well, are you Pie Man? How come whenever Pie Man’s around, you happen to be there too, Jim.” He's like, “Oh ha, ha. Yes. Well, you know?” He's thinking to himself, he’s like, “If I tell her this, if I tell her that I'm Pie Man, then she'll sleep with me.” Well, have sex with me and so he tells her that he is Pie Man. She's like, “Oh really? You’re Pie Man? Okay.” Then, she's like, “Well, why don't we go to the bar and you can tell me more about it?” So then, they go to the bar together and they just start talking about it. Yes,
