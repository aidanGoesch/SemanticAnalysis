The story begins with a guy, he’s a journalist who attends Fordham University, running the school magazine, and he’s going to this professor’s lecture. He has some questions to ask the professor. The professor’s on the stage, and he’s gotten up on to the stage to ask him. I don’t know - I don’t remember what the professor’s name was, but there was another guy who apparently was standing next to this journalist, and he has a pie in his hand, and the next thing you know, the professor’s getting pied in the face. The journalist waits a moment, and he then asked the professor, “What do you have to say about this? What comments do you have to make?” Then, the professor says, “Fuck you,” and then, the professor is a little bit salty about this. Then, the journalist writes this down, and then somehow, he’s – I don’t remember how the transition went, but he goes, I think, around campus, and he somehow got in to meet this girl, Angela, and this [Pause] - before Angela, there was - like, he’s meeting this other girl, this other person in a bar, I think, and apparently, this girl has gotten with this other professor behind closed doors because - to maybe advance her position and get more opportunities, and then - so, this journalist, the main character, knew that happened. Then, he meets this girl, Angela, and Angela, she has an inkling that the journalist is “pie” or something, and he doesn’t want to say yes. So, he says no. And then, I think eventually, he tells Angela, “Yes, I am pie,” and that was how the story ended, but like – yes, I’m done. [Pause] So, yes.
