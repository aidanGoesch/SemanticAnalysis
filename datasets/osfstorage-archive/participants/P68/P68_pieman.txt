A Fordham student seizes the day walking down the stairs. He rushes up to him to try to get the story because he's curious about what he'll say to a question, which I forgot what’s the question was, when suddenly, he sees a blur on the right side of his eye and the guy creams and puts a pie to the dean’s face and runs away. The narrator then asked the Dean McGowan, “Would you like to comment on what just happened?” The dean says, “FU,” and then the guy goes back to write a story for the newspaper and the story makes it onto the front page. He makes up a bunch of details in the story such as the guy who cream the dean is Pie Man, and he wore a cape, and he has a catchphrase something that’s in Latin. The English translation is, “I am not an animal.” After the paper gets published, Pie Man sees the story and says, “That was a great story.” He comments - he doesn't exactly say that that was a great story, but he says something about why if that meant that and tells her to meet him at the library the next day. He does. The narrator sees Shiela walking down the steps of the library. I forgot what happened after that. Afterwards, he writes a few more articles all of which are on the front page of the newspaper. Then one day, he's at a bar and sees Angela, who he's been flirting with for two months. The girl, while he's sitting at the bar, she taps him and asks, “Are you Pie Man?” He says he knows - he actually has never seen pie man at least not his face, but since he's the one who basically created Pie Man and for all the stories about him, he replies “Yes.” She says, “Buy me a beer and tell me all about it.” That’s the end of the story.  There was another detail in the story where he said Shiela is not like the other Fordham students, they were on a flat and have part-time jobs. She is different, and that’s all I remember.
