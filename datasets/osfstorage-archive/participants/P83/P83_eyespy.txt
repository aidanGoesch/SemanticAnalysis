So, the story was mostly about this woman and a – oh, the story starts off with a woman in a comic club. She was telling a story about how her parents had a very interesting tradition of going to church, and before then, she will go to like this brunch thing and then would eat lobster, and then she did not have very much fun as a kid. When her aunt took her and her sibling went to the beach, they were only allowed to go up to their knees, and she didn’t find that very fun, and she hit her uncle in the face really hard by accident and his eye came out of his socket and his skull, and she freaked out. And, truth be told, she was going on and on and on about that, and it turns out that it was actually a fake eye, and she never knew that it was a fake eye until now, and that was basically the climax to the story. 
   
Yes, the story wasn’t that really interesting, but the main part of it was the eye popping out of the poor guy’s skull, and the fact it was a fake eye and it happened in the beach. Honestly, that was really the main part of the story. Yes.
