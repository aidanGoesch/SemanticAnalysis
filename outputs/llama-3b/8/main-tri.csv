We got married in the court house that my husband worked on while he was roofing. My grandparents where the only ones able to come. They waited in the lobby with our youngest son who was just 2 months at the time while we took our 5 year old upstairs with us for the ceremony. It was short and simple. I wish that more family could have come to share the day with us but it was special and will be something t beat when we get our vows renewed in the future. When I was younger I did imagine me to at least have a nice white dress and a bridesmaid in a church. The fact that it wasnt in a church did bother me a little, and i wore a regular but nice red dress i got on sale for $40. I would have loved to have flowers because my husband always brings me red roses. Being that it was in between our birthdays will be nice for a anniversary. I am thankful that my kids where there. I am thankful that my grandparents where present. I am thankful to be able to legally marry my husband. And I am thankful that it was a nice day.

The hospital is only like ten minutes from my house, but on the way there, we got stopped in a line of cars that was waiting to let a family of ducks cross the road. My wife was trying to do her breathing, but kind of freaking out because she kept saying the baby was going to come any minute.  We finally got moving after like 10 minutes. I rushed her into the hospital where they immediately checked her and took her to the delivery room because there was no time to wait. The baby came so fast after that. My wife lost more blood than the doctor was comfortable with so we spent two days in the hospital. They felt it was okay to let me take my wife and baby boy home again after that. The nurses were really friendly. The doctor made sure to check everything. The baby was bigger than we thought he would be. He was 9 pounds.

This came as a surprise as I have only been at this job for eight months and there are people who have been there longer. I do feel as though I've been putting in more work than the others that I work with, but I was expecting it any more. This is a really significant milestone for me. I felt nervous coming into this job because it was out of my wheelhouse in terms of things that I've done in the past. Because of this, I've found myself coming in earlier and staying later to make sure that I have a grasp on all the things that I need to do here. It seems like this persistence impressed my supervisors and they went to the boss to ask that I be given a promotion and a raise. This is really a culmination of the effort I've put in to be a better employee and I'm happy with the result. Of course, I am. It's a promotion and a raise after only a short time at the job. This also means that if I decide to move on from this job that I will look better in the eyes of potential employers who may be interested in my services. I took this job on a whim, to be honest. I was unhappy at my last job and wanted to find a chance. After a few months, this is where I ended up. Now, I'm excelling at this new job and finding that my supervisors are aware of what I am doing. I think that I can make a longer career out of my time here if I continue on this road.

But she was so perfect, fat and sleepy and a full head of dark curls. I didn't want the nurses to take her out of the room or out of my sight, I wanted her beside me forever. I didn't expect to feel anything like this, I never really had an interest in children and getting pregnant was a mistake.

Pregnancy was a miserable, sick time for me, and birth was painful and exhausting and overwhelming, but it was all so worth it to make someone so cute and perfect that brings me so much happiness. I know I'm a better person now than I was before I had her, she's taught me so much patience and care and how to be unselfish. It's hard to believe sometimes that I made her and she is mine for the rest of our lives.",33CID57105FOWWJOBT3R19PLU2RL3S,,retold

I assured her that of course I wasn't mad, and that I would always love her no matter what. I also told her how proud I was of her. I just wanted her to be healthy and happy. I did remind her about making good choices in her relationships regardless of who they are with. We just jugged and cried for a while.

Everyone stood up and turned their heads as the bride walked into the hall. She was absolutely beautiful; stunning from head to toe. Her dress was barely touching the ground, yet her veil had a four foot train behind her. The whole ceremony only lasted about twenty minutes, and was well officiated by one of our close friends. After that, the wedding party headed to the banquet hall next door for a few drinks and appetizers. Luckily, it was open bar so I didn't have to pay for a glass of wine. An hour or so later, everyone settled into their seats as the DJ announced the new couple. They had their first dance, as well as the mother-son and father-daughter dances. Dinner came out shortly after the best man and maid of honor made their speeches. I ordered the steak, and it was cooked to perfection.

I drew immense pleasure when the marriage ceremony of my cousin was held. It was performed on 23rd of the last month. My parents and my uncle and aunt spent a whole week making necessary purchases. The whole house was color washed. The doors were republished. Our house looked like a bride. Many kinds of gold ornaments were bought for my cousin. Several clothes were also purchased for all the family members and relatives. My cousin herself chose clothes for her. Invitation cards were printed and were sent to friends and relatives. The feast on the date of marriage was very delicious. My parents were very busy. My aunt and uncle were also terribly engaged in different works. Our relatives were making our house a noisy place. The ladies were busy with religious ceremonies. Two cooks were engaged to prepare the dinner for the guests and the bridegroom party members. Cold drinks were ready. Large quantities of fresh fruits Were also arranged for the guests. My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at seven in the evening. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. The priest chanted sholkas from the Vedas. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine. The bride and the groom exchanged garlands and sacredly accepted each other as the partner of life.,,36PW28KO40IAAB8H3MVXBMD71BEAEO,recalled

He had asked my mom and dad for permission and when I opened my gift from him it was a ring and I looked at him and he was already on one knee! Planning the wedding was just as easy as my decision to marry him! He just wanted me happy and to have anything that I wanted. Both of our parents helped pay for things and that lifted a huge burden off of us. His sister helped with a lot of the planning since she was a professional wedding planner until she had children and stopped doing that. She helped pick out this wonderful natural location in the woods of a park that me and him met and went on frequent walks at. The location was so special to us! She picked out a wonderful live band and said that it would be so much better than having a DJ playing, and it was! The music was so good and it wasn't a typical crappy wedding band. This band was LEGIT! Another thing that really shocked me was how little the food cost but how much of it we had gotten! There was food for a month for everyone and it didn't cost an arm and a leg! The whole day was wonderful and really being married to the man of my dreams, surrounded by friends and family... the day couldn't have gotten better!",,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN1NJ1RC,imagined

Then we went to a castle for the actual day of the wedding. First, I got to see them walk down the aisle. Then, I got to see the official formalize the event and watch them dance. Then, we went to a reception. I got to hear speeches from many people that marked what an important event it was. The funniest speech was when they shared each other's many embarrassing secrets. It made the event lighter but also showed how much they knew and cared for each other. It was my first time at a wedding so it was a cool experience.

It is by far the most memorable day of my life. We met in high school, became teen parents, and had been dating for a little over 14 years. We had a long 5 year engagement, just to ensure that our wedding day was perfect. We paid for everything and planned everything on our own, which I think adds to memory of our special day. We both had input and we tailored our decisions to stay true to our love story, as well as highlighting our very different personalities. It was a great day and when we read our vows, people cried. We had a very intimate setting, very close friends and family only, and I think it made it that much more special. We really just focused on ourselves and each other, something a lot of couples forget to do. I've heard so many times, from friends and family, that they wish they could go back and do it all over again. I've heard a lot of stories about how the day flew by and that they never took the time to actually enjoy it. A lot of people regret the decisions they make when it comes to their wedding day. They wish they would have had a smaller or a less expensive wedding. A lot of my friends and family believe they wasted a large sum of money on one single day and ended up being in debt afterwards. We took all of those stories and we decided to not let that be our story. We bought everything with cash, nothing as a loan or on credit. We made our own smorgasbord of food and desserts. We treated it like Thanksgiving. It was awesome and delicious. We worried less about being flashy and classy and more about being comfortable and memorable. We wore what we wanted and didn't have a dress code for our guests. There was no rehearsal dinner, no huge reception. We told people to come as you are and bring their own drinks. Everyone really enjoyed just relaxing, eating good food, and letting loose. It was beautiful, laid back and there's nothing I would change about our special day.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVY0Z28VW,recalled

His name was Kich. He was 17. He was one of the best things to ever happen to me, hands down. He was black, long, and thin with elegant features. He lived a good life despite illnesses. He was such a good and sweet buddy, my most precious gift to have ever received from life. Now that I look back on it, I thought he was going to live strong seemingly forever because he could escape brushes with death and seemed that he could last longer, but slowly, his health started to decline until it was snowballing. I said goodbye to him in disbelief that he was really gone, that I couldn't do anything to keep him here, that I couldn't take away his suffering. I will never forget the moments when I saw him slip away forever. Just a couple days later, my other cat who lived with my ex husband died. He died at home of old age, just as his brother had. I still can't believe both my boys are gone and there's a part of my heart that is so empty without them. The only thing that makes it ok is that nothing can hurt my boys anymore. I guess this is the price to pay to make sure they no longer suffer.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRD8VCL,,retold

I was so surprised to get offered the job because I was not a perfect fit for it by any means.  I would have to learn a lot and pursue an additional degree.

Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it. We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on. But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face. He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days. Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was. Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much.

It was sudden and unexpected as he hadn't been ill and was quite young. It has been really hard to wrap up the estate. The bank that that held his truck loan refused to do anything with us until we went to probate. We went to the probate process and become executors of the estate. The day before we got the paperwork, the bank repossessed the truck. I was so mad with how they handled it and will never do business with them as a customer. Now, we'll just have to wrap the house. My mother and I own a portion, so we just need to deal with the remaining third he owned. Our lawyer recommends waiting until the state has time to make claims against the state, but frankly, I think he is wrong about the situation. He did not receive state-sponsored health care, so they have nothing to collect on. All in all, I am still stressed and now frustrated more than anything. I do not see why the family of the deceased essentially gets punished by everyone. He didn't have much debt and hardly any assets, but we still have to worry that someone will come out of no where and make claims that we couldn't pay. We don't want to sell the house, so we'd have to get cash somehow. I hope this will be done soon. I hate dealing with it.",3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWINY1JI,,retold

When our hair and make up was done, we left and went to her venue to get dressed. It was raining but that did not matter. All events were inside so we quickly ran in and did not let the rain bother us. I got to pick out any red dress I wanted to. I liked that we did not have to wear a specific bridesmaid dress. My sister got dressed and she looked so classic. Her dress was simple and really flattered her. When all was ready we walked down the aisle and had a fast ceremony. The place looked beautiful. It was still decorated for Christmas and just looked like a winter wonderland. The ceremony was quick and straight to the point but there were some really powerful moments. Once the ceremony was over the family took some pictures and then enjoyed cocktail hour. The food was fantastic and then once that was over we danced the night away.

I stayed with her while we got ready and got our hair and makeup done. I went for a simple up do and natural makeup. My sister kept her hair down with a clip and went for natural make up as well. We were allowed to pick out our own bridesmaid dresses as long as they were a shade of red. Her bridal party was just me and our other sister.

One of the most (if not the most) memorable parts was my best friend of over 20 years flying in from over 1200 miles to be in the wedding. While the wedding was about my now wife, and myself, it wouldn't have been the same without him.  It was a great event, and we had a blast.  My buddy brought his wife and child, and made great sacrifices to be there. It was one of the greatest events of my life, and we were beyond ecstatic they could make it. It was my wife's first time meeting him, as he lives a great distance away.  She hit it off with them very well, and we were both very thankful for not only them, but the way the event unfolded. He definitely fit in well and made for an enjoyable time. He has a sense of humor that is like mine and very raw, and it's pretty constant. He was telling jokes to everyone, and everyone seemed to appreciate it, except for one person, but I won't waste the time to add them into this. My wife and I have already discussed and are planning a trip to go visit him and his family in the coming year.  His family and my family have begun to forge a bond that I hope will last a lifetime.  It was overall a very joyous and memorable day. I couldn't be happier, and am very thankful that my wife accepted him in such open arms. On the flip side of that, I'm happy his family embraced us so lovingly as well.",3JC6VJ2SAC5AESFOSL2U7S7UFO55AB,,retold

As one would expect, it was a very significant step, and a very special moment in my life.  We opted to not go too overboard, and had under 100 guests total.  Everything went very well, and the memory of that day will stay in my mind, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life.  Besides our immediate family, I had my best friend come up from across the country to be my best man. I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. I don't get to see him too often, so when I do I take full advantage and try to enjoy every moment as much as possible.  Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents were there as well, as they are very important to me.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of people we had there, and probably felt as loved and important as I ever have in my life on account of all the people there. The only part that was a bit bothersome was with it being a wedding, and so many people, I didn't get much time to chat with each person, as I would have liked to. I've come to realize that's just how weddings are with so many people and only so much time, that it's part of the gig.  But beyond that, it was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed myself a great deal. My wife looked gorgeous (as usual), and I am overly thankful to spend the rest of my life with her.  The photographer did an excellent job, and I helped her out by being a joker and keeping people laughing and smiling which helped with pictures. It was a great day, and I am still ecstatic that I got to share our special day with such great people.  The caterer did fantastic, and the venue we used was absolutely perfect, and extremely affordable.  It did rain a little bit, but we managed to dodge the brunt of it, which was good as we had planned and hoped to have it outdoors.  We did have a backup plan if we would have to move it inside, but we were hoping that we could keep it outdoors.

My cousin, the son of my mother’s oldest sister, has gotten engaged. It’s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom’s side — granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it’s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around.[12:04 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: It’s not that we’re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It’s that my cousin’s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai. Most of my mom’s family is still in Shanghai, and my cousin who is getting married lives with my aunt and my uncle and my grandmother in the same house that my mother grew up in as a child. My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak. Instead of focusing on re-learning the language in the year I had, I shoved it to the bottom of my mental to-do list. By the time December 2012 rolled aroun[12:11 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: I was no better at remembering how to say “Where is the bathroom?” than 12 months earlier. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, the reality of being in China’s largest city began to settle in. On the streets, taxis weaved in and out of lanes, miraculously avoiding crashes by near inches. People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn’t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese. My family had been assigned a big table[12:18 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: together, and we could enjoy the wedding with each other.",3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMK0ADAG,,retold

She is the sweetest most adorable baby girl I have ever seen, but I may be biased! After having a toddler that's 100% boy, and can destroy things with great ease, I hope she is a much more calm experience. At least until her teens, then there's a whole-nother set of problems to worry about. I look forward to the future to see what they'll both become. You never know what life has in store for you.

He had trouble breathing, and he had been in the emergency room since a week ago. I assumed for the worst, hoped for the best. My uncle had throat cancer for about a year now. He couldn't speak with the majority of his tongue removed. My cousin, his son, said he realistically had limited time, about a week. I lived with their family for a while when I was young. I could hear the words, but it just didn't register. If that's the case, I couldn't imagine what they were feeling. And, just like that, a week later, he died. I woke up in a groggy state from a phone call. He said ""my dad passed away earlier this morning."" And for the next few days, it's just been a gloomy state. We had the funeral shortly afterwards as well as attending services. I'm fine, but it's just weird knowing someone you knew your entire life is gone, just like that. I can come visit their house...but the body is gone. And my other family members are freaking out because he is the youngest from the brothers and sisters. It just makes you realize you can die at any given moment and to just live your life. You can die in twenty-five years, or you can die today. So while it's not about the length of time you lived, it's what you did in that lifetime.

I met some new friends and had a great time. The day of the wedding was actually a lot of fun. The pictures were beautiful and we had fun doing them. It was pretty relaxed getting ready.

I live six hours from her now so it was wonderful to catch up with her. We spent the first night eating dinner together and we had the best time. I loved getting to know her friends and her fiance better. The next day we spent most of the day getting ready for the wedding. We went and got our nails done. We went to lunch together. We went to the church and began setting up for the wedding. The day of the wedding we went to the church early so that we could get ready and relax as well. We had so much fun watching each other get our hair and makeup done. When it was time for the actual wedding we got a lot of great pictures. We told a lot of jokes to try to keep our nerves calm! The actual wedding was beautiful. Everything went smoothly and not one thing went wrong. After the wedding we had a beautiful reception with great food, a picture booth, and lots of great friends getting to chat. It was one of the best events I have been to in a long time.

After what seemed like forever but was really only a short period, my cat Stubbs has passed on. I had known that he was sick but had been giving him medicine to treat his kidney issues for a while and he had seemed stable. Then in the lead up to this, he stopped eating or drinking, had trouble even walking, and had a dull glassy look in his eyes. I took him to the vet in a panic whereupon he informed me that Stubbs red blood cell count was dangerously low and his kidneys had degraded even further. After spending a week under observation there being given fluids and medicine I was allowed to take him home, under orders to inject a saline solution into him every day which he understandably was not overly happy about (and the scars from the scratches and bites on my arms can attest to that), but it seemed to be working for several months. Then he just abruptly degraded again do it was back to the vet, they did the usual treatment and observation before letting me bring him home, but this time was different and I think we all knew it, but no one wanted to say that I was just taking him home so he could die in a place of comfort rather than a cage surrounded by people he didn't know. He was fine for a short while upon coming home seeming to have one last gasp of energy where he was friendly and playful, but the other cats could sense something was off and kept their distance.  All too soon he found himself unable to even stand and was forced to drag himself around the room on his side, even picking him up caused him to yowl in pain. The end was upon us that night, there was a loud screech from him in the middle of the night and by the time I had gotten out of bed and over to him he was already dead. It was heartbreaking to witness it, but at the least it wasn't drawn out forever with him in pain, and when the worst of it came he passed fairly quickly. Both I and my remaining cats were in a malaise for days, as they could tell he wasn't coming back this time. I had him cremated and then buried wrapped in his favorite blanket that he'd drag around everywhere. It was hard on me but I'm happy I was able to give an older (15) cat a new home to enjoy his remaining days rather than languishing at a shelter. It's going to make it all the harder to go through this another three times as my other cats get on in years though and I'm coming to dread every ailment that they suffer out of fear of it being the prelude to this happening again.",,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6197J89G,recalled

I was promoted about 3-4 months ago and have steadily taken on additional roles and responsibilities in my new position. Recently we lost a couple low performers on my team. I have volunteered to take on additional job duties to help spread the added work load around the team. I have continued to have nothing but success at this job and I continue to get great feedback from other workers. I have recently gotten a couple monetary bonus' for my work and have even gotten a 10% raise. I am very excited about where I am this early in my work career. I will be having my first annual review shortly and I am confident this will get me another decent raise. I can very easily see myself staying at this company for numerous years and rising even further in the ranks. I would really enjoy leading a team of analysts and having that level of power. I think I could be a very good manager, because I have had both really good and really bad managers to learn from. I am hoping for another promotion in the next review cycle and so far I have no reason to believe it won't happen. I recently joined a new team and I've been very open with my new manager that I am very interested in taking on even more tasks. I am very lucky to be where I am and I am loving my job, it is exactly what I was wanting to do after college.

I laughed to myself (derisively of course) about how it's too bad I'm not anybody famous or important's cousin or niece. I'd probably find a job easy if that were the case!

I think our average age is only 22 years old!  I knew something was happening when my boss asked me to come into his office. Once I got in there he had a big smurk on his face, so I knew then it must be good.  He immediately told me that we exceeded our goal by 25%, and that our salaries would be increasing as a result. I've worked so hard the past year to make this goal happen, I'm thrilled that its finally actually happening. With all the extra money I'll be making, I can now pay off my student loans that much faster. It's been quite a struggle the past 12 months paying my regular bills and my student loans. Now that I'll have this extra income, I may even have a little left for some fun entertainment after work some nights. After I left the office, my other 4 co-workers were watching me.

They were going to check on me via ultrasound.  As they began the ultrasound the nurse noticed that my fluids - the amniotic fluids my son was living in - were looking low.  She took the proper measurements and excused herself to make a call.  For days I had felt I was leaking amniotic fluid but doctors and nurses who I remarked this too just laughed.  They chalked it up to the over imagination of a pregnant woman 5 days past her due date.  Nonetheless, since 5 days had passed and still no baby they brought me in for a routine exam.  When the nurse came back into the room she announced that she had spoken with my midwife and that the news she was going to deliver ""probably isn't going to come as a surprise but the midwife wants to keep you overnight.""  It was a surprise.  I was at the hospital with my daughter and husband and we didn't have anything packed or ready.  Regardless, I was ushered upstairs to a room and put into a hospital gown while my husband and daughter rushed home to grab supplies and our overnight bag - prepared months in advance.  When they returned, the doctors had already started me on the medicines necessary to start induction.  It was time to have this baby!  While this took me completely by surprise, I can't say I wasn't a little bit anxious.  After all, he was supposed to have been born almost a week prior!  A little over 8 hours later at 3:30 in the morning my son came into the world - late, unexpected, and with a little help from several kinds of medicine!",3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ5SD7A0,,retold

We sat in the waiting room of the hospital - my daughter, my fiance, and myself - and waited to be called back.  The waiting room of the ultrasound department was always busy - lots of women and men waiting to be seen and wait times upwards of an hour and a half.  My appointment had been scheduled for 3 but it was nearly 5 pm when I was finally called in.  They dimmed the lights in the exam room and proceeded to take measurements.  The nurse remarked that my amniotic fluids looked a bit low.  Otherwise, the  baby looked well.  She said she would call my midwives and see what they wanted to do.  She was gone for sometime and when she came back she told me that they wanted to induce me and that I was likely not shocked.  She was wrong.  I was not expecting to be induced and I was not expecting to stay at the hospital that very day.  They whisked my away to another room and began to process the admittance forms.

I also was able to afford a new car which helped greatly because I had to rely on taking the bus previously.  I had more responsibilties but I enjoyed it.

I had been working there as an associate for around four years at my retail store.  I would always work hard to do my best and finally and all came to fruition.  I was promoted to the manager of the store and would be making much more money.  This was greatly welcomed because I could now move to a new apartment as my old apartment was very old causing many bugs to appear.  I was congratulated by my peers for achieving this position as they had always confided in me with their problems at work and knew I would be easily accessible if they had any problems with their job.  Achieving this position also gave me a sense of responsibility as I had to take care of employee needs, customer needs, and the financial state of the store I was managing.  This made me feel more respected and confident in my abilities.  While managing, I found I enjoyed this position very much. I was able to meet many people higher up in authority in the store and speak to them about achieving an even better position.  What I felt about my position was that I achieved something that I worked very hard for.  I decided to splurge and also buy a new car due to my promotion.  Since becoming a manager, my lifestyle has greatly increased.  I have more health care available.  I have a better living arrangement.  I don’t have the type of anxiety anymore about possibly not achieving my goal.

She selected to dress up as Jasmine from Aladdin because she liked the outfit.  When we got to the party, there were a bunch of girls dressed as princesses playing princess themed yard games. My daughter said hello to the birthday girl and joined in the games. I walked over to the group of parents standing by the refreshment area to introduce myself. The birthday girl's mom, whose name is Sheila, welcomed me and told me that cake would be soon because it was a special surprise cake. About 30 minutes later, Sheila called everyone to come gather around the refreshment area. When everyone was gathered and silently waiting, Sheila yelled, ""Okay, cake, come on out!"" Out walked the most beautiful Princess Belle that I had ever seen. She was gorgeous, and wearing the most stunning yellow dress, just like in the movie. Sheila walked up to her with a knife and stabbed the dress while everyone gasped in horror. Sheila and Belle looked at each other and laughed, the dress was the cake! I had never seen anything like it, not even on the cake making shows on television. It was mind blowing. Belle stood still while Sheila cut everyone a piece of the dress cake. I doubted that it would taste very good, thinking that there must be a trade off for the amazing appearance of the cake.

When my supervisor told me of my promotion, he was quite pleased that he had finally managed to make this happen, especially since he was starting a new job in a different department soon and this was one thing he wanted to achieve before he was no longer my supervisor. He came into my office one morning and slid a folded piece of paper on my desk.

This information fell a bit flat to me because it was much less than I had originally anticipated a promotion would bring. I received the same percentage increase for my promotion that I typically do for my annual raise. Seeing that lower number disappointed me, but I felt I couldn't show my supervisor my disappointment because he was so happy. Showing my disappointment would have been a slap in the face to my supervisor. He felt that he had done me a solid and the promotion, as well as the pay increase, was quite fair. It may be that I had the wrong ideas of what pay increase follow promotions. It could also be that my last promotion with the significantly higher increase was a fluke. I don't have much experience with promotions and don't know what is typical in the company.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,,retold

My boss walked into my office like he typically does and it's usually to chat about work related stuff as well as to chat in general about how things are going. This time, he started off chatting about normal, routine work stuff and then casually threw in that my promotion was finally approved and about to go into effect. He's been pushing for my promotion for over a year and a half at that point and I had almost given up all hope of this happening any time soon. Evidently, the higher up managers approved the promotion as well as Human Resources. A salary was also approved and my manager informed me of what that new, higher salary would be. I felt relieved that this finally happened and I could stop wondering about my upcoming promotion. At the same time, once my supervisor told me the percentage raise I would receive, I was slightly disappointed. The percentage of my increase equaled the usual annual salary increase I received the past couple of years, even without a promotion. I was unsure if this signified that my past annual increases were abnormally high or if my promotion salary increase was abnormally low. I was hoping for a much bigger raise. Ultimately, my supervisor informed me that there is a cap on how high of an increase an employee can receive in any given year and hopefully there will be more of a raise coming up after my annual review in a couple of months. Given that we had just had my annual review, performance reviews, and all that, I was hopeful that perhaps, even with my recent promotion, I would still qualify for a significant raise when the fiscal year was over. I didn't tell my supervisor about my disappointment with the percentage increase because he was so happy that he was able to get my promotion pushed through after all this time. I didn't want to deflate him or make him feel that his efforts were unappreciated.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,recalled

I got to spend time with a lot of my family all at the same time, including some members that I don't get to see often. I had a wonderful day for the most part, and we had a lot of fun with our families. However, there was a couple unexpected events that made the day less than perfect. For starters, my MIL was being mean and said some negative things about me to my own father. She was not the only one that caused some issues during my wedding. My husband's aunt decided to take it upon herself to cut my wedding cake. Not only did she cut the cake without asking, she also destroyed the cake and ruining the top tier that my husband and I were planning to save for later for just the two of us. She made a mess out of our special piece, and offered it to guests. When removing our top layer, she dropped in on it's side on another plate. I will never forgive her for what she did, as the cake cutting was something that I had been looking forward to and planning since we first started planning the wedding. Even though it really upset me, I decided I wasn't going to show my anger or make a big scene. My close family knew that it upset me and helped make me feel better. I didn't want to ruin the day completely, so I just decided to continue on with the day and enjoy spending time with the people I actually care about and care about me. I avoided the aunt throughout the entire day.",3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943677LH1U7,,retold

We had planned a small party, just ourselves and grandma.  We decided to do a cake smash to get some cute photographs.  I baked a cake and decorated it with cut strawberries.  We tried to take a video of him smashing the cake, but he was too obsessed with the strawberries.  He insisted on picking off and eating each one individually.  Eventually we had to turn off the video and just wait for him to finish eating the strawberries.  When he finally did get to the cake, he jumped right in with both hands and made such a mess.  It was adorable and made for some great pictures. I think I was the only parent who ever wanted their kid to stop eating fruit and eat cake! It was so fun though. He had a great time. We're looking forward to the next one. I enjoy showing the photos to other people. He's one cute kid!",3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJGBSX88,,retold

Before everyone else got there, there was a cocktail hour with wine and some snacks.  It was alot of fun.  The air was hot outside though, so we were glad went the service was over and we could go inside to the ac.  We were sweating alot.  They had italian food for the dinner.  And even more importantly, they had drinks upstairs at the open bar.  The bar had a few options for mixed drinks. My favorite was a drink with rum and cherries.  It was red. Then we at the italian food for dinner and had some cake.  The cake was white wedding cake and very good.  There were more drinks and even some dancing.  To take a break from dancing we went outside to get air.  But it was still hot outside, so we walked around the garden only for a little bit.  THen we came back inside.  We danced for about 2 more hours before it was time to go. Overall, it was a great evening and the couple seemed pretty happy. What made it so memorable was the good friends that all came together. I was most surprised that the bride and groom bought a open bar for the occasion cause those are expensive.",,,recalled
