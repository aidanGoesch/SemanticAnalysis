I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,imagined

It was a western which is outside of my normal book choices.  It was titled ""Lonesome Dove"" and was written by Larry McMurtry.   ""Lonesome Dove"" is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.  The two main characters are Gus and McCall.  They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.  They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.  I think it as Montana.  The book had very rich character development.  There were good guys, bad guys, and in-between guys.  On of the major villains is the a really bad guy name ""Blue Duck"".  One of the in-between is a girl/woman named Lori.  She is a ""lady of the night"" but sweet just the same.  Gus and McCall are kind of the good guys.  The scenery and imagery are very rich.  It is very colorful in terms of the language.

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book.  As such the others paled in comparison.",30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,recalled

I started by searching the internet for anything I could find. I was surprised at how much you could learn and how complex it could be but I didn't let it scare me; I continued in my quest to learn more. I was intrigued by just how many wild foods there were out there available for us to eat. It made me realize that people aren't using the natural resources we have and that there are a lot of things that are going to waste just because we don't know it's available to us. After a week of doing extensive research, I decided to go on a hunt and see exactly what I could find. I drove about an hour away to a location that was plentiful of forest and wildlife that I thought would suit me for my foraging needs. As I walked through the woods, I stumbled upon things I had not recognized from my research, so I had to use my best judgement about whether or not this was something that could be edible. I found a patch of wild berries that looked good so I decided to try my luck and eat one. They were very sweet and did not have a bitter taste, so I ate a few more before continuing on my way. Further on my travels, I saw some wild plants so I decided to pick them and take them home with me to see what I could do with them. This was turning out to be quite the interesting adventure. I heard a rustling noise behind me so I abruptly looked over my shoulder and realized that I had entered someone else's territory. Instead of seeing a person like I expected, I saw a beautiful deer standing behind me. It didn't run away like I thought, but just looked at me inquisitively, stopped to take in the sights and smells of nature, and then slowly walked away. At that moment, I thought to myself, people and animals aren't all that different. We are all here for the same reason; survival and to try and protect what is ours. As it started getting dark, I figured it was time to pack up and take my findings home. My stomach was feeling a little bit queasy and I was hoping it wasn't the berries I ate from earlier!",,31LVTDXBL8WGFY4QMJ4NJ7S1QAXLR0,imagined

Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it. I started thinking about the plants around me when I saw a foraging video on YouTube. A teacher was showing students about all of the edible plants in a park that happens to be near my house. I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too. I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery. It's amazing to see something all around you that was always there but you never saw before. I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.",31LVTDXBL8WGFY4QMJ4NJ7S1QAXLR0,,retold

It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call ""weeds"" are actually nutritious and delicious plants. I have grown alot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust has gone up. It has been a great experience.

It was not your typical honeymoon, we spent our honeymoon acting like kids, and it was great. We spent a large majority of our time riding our favorite rides, and just pretending we were children again. We decided on our first honeymoon trip was  going to Six Flags in Atlanta, Georgia, since it was where we had our first date. We rode almost all of the rides, and re-lived our first date. After Six flags, we went to Disney world in Orlando, Florida. It was our first time there, and we were a bit overwhelmed with all of the rides and activities there, but we had a great time. While in Orlando, we stumbled upon another theme park, which was a water park. To be honest, we had more fun at the water park than we did at Orlando, we were there for hours! Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks. One was definitely one of the smallest ones we have been to, but it had a lot of charm to it. The last one we went to, was a very massive one, almost the size of the Disney world one in Orlando. I think our last theme park was the best one. The rides were fantastic. The food was amazing. The prices were reasonable. After it was all said and done, we were very happy with our decisions and had a fantastic time.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DUP1072,imagined

However, because of our schedules, we couldn't go on our honeymoon until June 2019. Prior to the honeymoon I had some very important work due, and I was really looking forward to the time to have fun. We both love theme parks, and so our honeymoon was to visit six new theme parks. We started at Holiday World in Indiana. They had amazing roller coasters, including one named Voyage, that is now in my top five of all time. They also had tons of great water rides. After that, we went to Kentucky Kingdom. It was a small park, but had some nice coasters. Unfortunately, it was 100 degrees and humid, and for some reason the water park wasn't open. Because of this, we left really early to get to our next destination, Dollywood. Sadly, we had to cancel the visit to Dollywood because of a huge storm. Instead, we continued on to Carowinds, and got to ride Fury 325, which is now my second favorite coaster. We spent two days in Charlotte, where Carowinds is, and then headed to Virginia to go to Kings Dominion. The park was amazing. We both loved intimidator 305 and Twisted Timbers. After this, we headed to Philadelphia to enjoy the city itself, with no theme parks. Our final stop was in Toronto, where we enjoyed the city, and a great theme park, called Canada's Wonderland. The most memorable part of the Honeymoon was probably the first park. It was so good and we had the rush of the vacation just beginning.",324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DUP1072,,retold

The first park was called holiday world and was in Santa Clause Indiana. Next, we went to Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky. After this, we were supposed to go to Dollywood, but the rain canceled it. Our next park was Carowinds, just outside Charlotte North Carolina. We were there long enough for a day in the park and the city. After this, we went to Kings Dominion in Doswell Virginia. They have a coaster that pulls so many G's everyone blacks out or gets close to it. After a day here, we visited Philadelphia. We spent a night and day in the city. We toured around the sites and ate plenty of Cheesesteaks and Dinic's roasted pork sandwiches. Our final stop was Toronto and Canada's Wonderland just outside the city. We spent three days. This was we made sure to take in as much as the city had to offer. We also stopped on the way there to see Niagara Falls. I had never seen it from the Canadian side.

Two months ago in May, my sister-in-law passed away. It was sudden and very tragic. She was driving home from work in the rain when she lost control of her car and get into an accident on the interstate. It feels like I was just talking to her and planning our next get together. We'd planned to go to a concert with my brother and sister in July. I didn't like the artist that we were going see, but it was for her birthday that we'd missed doing something for in February. She had been waiting to go that concert for years but hadn't been able to because our work schedules didn't line up. I considered my sister-in-law as much one of my actual siblings as my brother and sister are. She'd been there for my wife and I through some hard times and was always willing to lend a hand to help us with the children. I can't believe that she's gone and I know that it's tougher on my wife. This is a very tragic time for both of our families, because she was really a light in our lives. My family is pulling through as best we can and are making sure that we are there for each other in this trying time. The funeral was difficult, but it was attended by so many people and my sister-in-law would've really been happy to know how many lives she touched when she was still here. I think that if anything good can come out of this is that we'll be more of a bonded family. We know that's what she would've wanted us to do and we'll honor her in this way.

She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.  She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.  She had a meeting with someone from her church that morning.  She went outside to show her friend her garden and then her friend left.  She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.  We had video footage from security cameras to show us exactly what happened.  She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.  She braced herself temporarily before falling to the ground completely.  My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance.  She was basically on life support from that time until she passed away about 8 hours later.  It has been 5 months since it happened and it still seems so surreal.

It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT.  It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason.  My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.  He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife.  She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.  Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert.  She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.  She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.  She passed away that night.  We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.  My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away.  He said it just didn't feel right.  After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go.  His oldest son took her place.  It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed.  We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.",324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G,recalled

A beautiful lake that the wedding venue looked over. We all spent time on the deck drinking and smoking cigars. One of the shocking events was watching my cousin (female) smoking a cigar with the men. Then to top it off her mom who was 70+ comes out and takes the cigar from her and takes a few puffs on it. Again the reason it was meaningful to me was it had been 10+ years since I had seen many of the people. My wife and I actually were thinking that we last saw them when my wife was pregnant with our 12 year old daughter. It was the first time I actually danced at a formal event with my daughter.

Two weeks ago, I got a promotion. This promotion I had been waiting and hoping for, for the last year. I was finally promoted to Assistant Manager. It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July. It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early. I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines. At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did. I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager. I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before. I like to do well in the goals and tasks that I have set for myself on a daily basis when it comes to my job, or anything that I do. I am very grateful for this opportunity to be in this new position and so grateful to my employers above me that felt that I deserved this opportunity and are wanting me to progress and grow along side the company. I have put so much time and effort into this place and it's starting to pay off. I know that if I put in the amount of hours, work, and dedication that I can achieve anything and for that I am so proud and honor to be apart of this establishment. I am over the moon about this promotion and I ended up celebrating with my loved ones and family members with a bottle of bubbly berry juice (as I and my family members are not a fan of alcoholic beverages) and we went out to dinner afterwards to celebrate this new chapter of my life.",,32ZKVD547G9CJNXCKGEXN6TG8BC3BI,imagined

We decided to take the other bus, the one recommended by the host of the party. We missed that bus by a few minutes.

We did not tell her that that's what we were bringing. It came out really well, and she loved did, as did her Cuban-born husband.

It was held at the home of my cousin's former husband in New Jersey. Last year, he came and picked up me and my partner at our place in New York and drove us there. This time, although one of the cousin's organizing the event said she'd try to arrange transportation, she was unable to do so, so we took the bus. This involved taking the subway to Port Authority in Manhattan, then a bus to New Jersey, then calling my cousin on arrival to have someone pick us up. The whole trip should have take a couple of hours. I looked at Google Maps before leaving the house, and planned our route. We left the house in ample time to catch the bus suggested by the app. On the way to the bus, I called my cousin to confirm that we were on our way. I found out that the host of the party said we should take a different bus, which was a route run by a different bus company. Naturally, this ran on a different schedule. When we arrived at the terminal, we found we'd have to wait an hour for our bus. When we finally got on the bus, we were relieved, and figured we see everyone in about an hour's time. Were we mistaken! We hit one of the worst traffic jams I have ever encountered. The trip took well over two hours. By the time we arrived, some of the guests were already leaving. The best part of the whole party was that one of my cousins had come all the way from Massachusetts. She had told me about a year ago that she loves coconut flan. So, I made it and did not tell her. She was so surprised and pleased that she cried. Her husband, who is Cuban, pronounced it ""Tremendo!""

It wasn't actually my mom (obviously) but she looked similar enough where I had to go talk to her. She was a very interesting woman, and surprisingly, she wasn't taken aback by anything I said. I told her that I thought she might be related to me. I told her my own name, my mother's name, and even some extended family's names. But she said that she had never heard of any of them.

It's crazy because the same can be said for my friend Megan. Megan and I went to college together and lived in the same apartment complex for three years. We have always been close but never really spoke of being interested in each other romantically. It's funny but we just never seemed to be single at the same time. Then one night we were out with another friend at a bar together and joked about how we should just give up looking for a partner and date each other. It was then that a light bulb seemed to go off in both of our heads. Our other friend ended up leaving early so we just chatted all night and eventually went home together. We hit it off perfectly. We have always had great chemistry together and shared many interests, so it made sense. We also appeared to be very much attracted to each other. This only happened a month ago, but we still have yet to inform some of our good friends. Most of them will think we are crazy too. But sometimes that can be inevitable with a big group of friends like we have. I know right now that Megan and I seem like a perfect match.

My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat. We stayed with my wife's cousin and were there primarily to visit my wife's aunt. She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life. The first full day were were in Colorado we were taken to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range. My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was ""rescued"" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again.

It was truly an awe inspiring trip. We drove through twisting roads, climbing ever higher, until we finally reached a height of over 11,000 feet. During the trip we were able to pull over at a number of spots to take photos of the breathtaking scenery. In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos. Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover. It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier. Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States. It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains. We were able to get our fill of souvenirs which we stock up on every vacation so we can easily remember the places we've been and the things we did. Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting. Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids.

The doctors really didn't think she could live safely at home. Shortly after she died in the nursing home. It was the day we got the whole family together to visit her. I am really devastated about this all happening so fast. I still feel like I should be able to contact her anytime. I sometimes wonder if I just speak into the sky if she will hear me. I really should know better. I have never believed in that stuff. My family has been really supportive of one another. I am really glad they are all able to lean on each other.

It happened so quickly, that I had no chance to help her or slow her fall.  I realized at that time that it didn't matter whether I was there or not, she was deteriorating and she would fall again.  I knew that at some point, she would break a bone. That is exactly what happened.  She broke a bone in her wrist when  I wasn't there.  I was actually quite relieved when the hospital suggested rehab.  I hoped it would help strengthen her.  I also hoped that the rehab center would be able to convince her to use her walker, as I had been unable to do. She worked hard at rehab and was getting stronger.  She was never strong enough to go home, and she passed quietly in her sleep.  I had hoped that she would be able to come home again.

We invited friends and family through word of mouth and on phone and everyone was eager to grace the occasion. On the d-day, he took me to a nice restaurant for breakfast. My sister later came in that day. He assisted with the cookies I was making. I already negotiated with a restaurant to supply us a nice meal. Around 4 pm, family and friends were welcomed with love genre songs to which everyone flowed. The elderly ones holding their spouse and swinging to all directions slowly. The younger ones eyeing each other and making advances. We watched from a corner as everything was unfolding. My best friend gave a funny speech and everyone laughed their hearts out. It was my turn to say something about my husband. I couldn't manage a minute before tears of joy started rolling down my cheeks.

I played her songs that we had listened to together over the years. She was mostly quiet as I stroked her head. I told her stories about our life together. I told her what a great dog and friend she had been. I told her that it was okay to go. It would hurt me worse than I could imagine but I had to let her go.

The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed. She perked up for a little while and I placed her on her bed on the floor to spend some time with her before I called the vet. I held her head on my lap and pet her. This day was also the memorial service for my uncle that had just passed away. So I was home alone. It seemed like it happened so quickly.

They laughed and joked a lot, and we had a very good time. I think the best part of the night was after dinner. We decided to go to her house to drink some coffee. She has a little dog named Bailey, and he doesn't really like new people. When my boyfriend sat down on the couch, however, Bailey was immediately taken with him.

We met at the restaurant, a local burger joint/bar.  The three of us had a great time! Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully.  Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house.  Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog.

We went there on his actual birthday for a couple hours and saw a cool show. The night of his birthday we had reservations at a nice restaurant. We had a great meal. On the way back it was raining and we didn't have an umbrella. We were running to the train and trying not to get wet. When we got back to my apartment we had his birthday dessert.

I was worried about the amount of past income I might owe back taxes on. So I went to a tax accountant in early 2019. It turned out that I owed about 6k in back taxes for the previous four years.

I needed to file amended returns for the Patreon income from four previous years. I'd been under the impression since I set up my Patreon account that it was gift income, and therefore non-taxable. But gradually it became my primary source of income and I shifted to self-employment as a freelance writer. And the more I looked into it the more I began to suspect it was taxable after all. I feared getting into serious trouble. In July of last year I concluded that it was indeed taxable. So I made plans to see an accountant and file for back taxes. According to my research on Google the IRS was required to allow installment payments I could afford, but I was still quite apprehensive in the months leading up to the meeting. In March I met with the accountant, gave him documentation of the additional income, and paid him $400 for preparing four years' amended returns. This was considerably cheaper than my worst-case estimate, and was in itself a significant relief. And he confirmed my information about making installment payments. In the months since, the IRS sent me a bill for back taxes and I arranged a modest $64/month installment payment. I also subtract 15% self-employment tax. It's a total tax burden I'm able to bear relatively easily, and a great load off my mind.",38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAB4YLI4,38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAB4YLI4,recalled

I came face-to-face with how I was truly missing out on life, on what matters most.  Unlike some people that realize too late they missed time with a loved one, I get to start over now.  The day started like any other day.  I mindlessly went through my routine, made sure my spouse was ready for work, and dropped my kid off at school.  Nothing different happened that morning or during that day.  Like normal, I just did my job, made some money, ran errands, cleaned the house, and started some things for dinner.  I had coffee with my friend, chatting about our many responsibilities and how grateful we were for any breaks from spending time with others, how heavy our workloads were and how school gave us a little break in our day from childcare. That afternoon, I went to go pick up my kid from school.  I ended up driving behind that same friend, who had kids in the same school.  There was a school bus stopped along the rode, which was a rural highway.  I saw it and slowed down, but my friend in front of my didn't see it.  She ran right over children who were getting off the bus.  The kids were killed in that horrible accident.  My friend couldn't even offer condolences; she was just saying how busy she was and that she didn't see.  She was too busy to see the bus stopped, too busy to see the precious lives in front of her...too busy...too busy.  I picked up my kid and went home, too moved to eat dinner that night.  I could have been that woman: too busy to see; too busy with what?  Too busy with chores that never end to spend precious time with loved ones?  Too busy to spend time praying, or doing worthwhile hobbies that I enjoy?  Am I too busy to pass those hobbies, those precious moments and memories on to my kids?  I realized that I had been going through life numb, as if on auto-pilot, just checking off tasks on a list.  All the while, the things that truly matter were passing me by.  I hugged my spouse and child close, and determined that I would no longer miss what's important in life.  Each day is precious:  I will remember and truly learn to live.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,imagined

I feel like I'm living my days like a robot and not connecting with anyone. It's like a lightbulb went off and I realized what all I'm missing out on. I've been going through the motions of the day and going about my life like a schedule. Now, that I finally see what I've been doing I know what I have to change. It means no more living on auto pilot and loving the same way. I realize how I need to take the extra time to show my kids how much I love them and not just expect them to just know. I realize I need to change up the monotonous everyday and show them by actually saying it more out loud and not expecting them to know because I do the standard things everyday that they've come to expect of me. Everyone needs to truly feel and understand that they're loved which I've realized can't be done on the same monotonous auto pilot mode. It's time to go outside of the norm and truly show it. I have literally changed my everyday life from a simple realization. By actually showing my love and speaking my truth it has made not only my children much happier and more willing to talk openly to me about what's going on in their lives, but it's also made me so much happier. Living on auto pilot happens way to often and I feel like I can't be the only one in the same boat. I feel like my advice when talking with friends and family has really had a positive impact on them as well. It's sad that we forget, so often, that our loved ones should just see our love just because we do the things we are required to do to care for one another. It is not only myself living on auto pilot but me putting my kids on auto pilot and I had to make a change. I'm so thankful I did because it's made my relationship with my children a much more positive one.",38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,,retold

You just wake up each day and go through the same routine as though you're on auto pilot. You wake the kids, walk the dog and go to work then the next thing you know the work day is over then it's back home to get ready for bed and start the cycle all over again. Days turn into weeks and weeks into months and you wonder where the time went while waiting to reach this destination of happiness you've been longing to find for as long as you can remember. Recently, in one of those brief moments of wonder and longing I did more than reminisce over time and it's elusive passing. I decided that I was tired of the same thing every day and tired of the waiting for something more when it's not possible to know how much time you have left. I keep waiting for this happiness like it's a destination when I had to remind myself that being happy is a mood. Sometimes it's brief and sometimes it's replaced by sadness, bitterness, or anger. I reminded myself it was time to actually live my life and that meant having more of these happy moments so I decided to get off of auto pilot and truly live. I had been at the same job for almost 7 1/2 years and it has been a great place to work, but felt stuck in a job I just had to go to because I felt it was my only option. I had found  extra work in an online platform and it was nice to have extra income in times when I needed it. I started to think about my job and how I had to miss out on things with my kids because of work and I decided to just quit. Out of the blue, I just quit my job after 7 1/2 years and decided I was going to support myself and my children by committing to work full time online so I would be a single stay at home mom. After I actually done this I felt empowered but by the next day I felt terrified because I had devoted 7 1/2 years to a job I had planned to retire from. I questioned myself and then realized, this chapter was officially over. I had taken the kids to school and it was time for me to get online and work. This was almost 3 weeks ago. It has been a struggle so far and I'm learning how to navigate my time when it comes to working online, but it's been rewarding. This destination of happiness, while I realized it's a mood and not so much a destination, I have spent much more time feeling it. I've not only been able to take my kids to school, but I've actually been able to watch my 14 year old son's soccer games and haven't missed a baseball practice for my younger son and we've spent more time hiking and going to the dog park. I know it won't be easy but I am tired of living on auto pilot. For the first time in as long as I can even remember I'm happy and that's an incredible feeling. I hope to find more work online because I need more income soon, but I feel as though things will work out for the best. Sometimes you have to choose yourself and actually live. This was my time and I'm proud to say I chose me.",38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL33P6WB,recalled

I was ecstatic and very surprised when I received the 12 checks in the mail from the lawyer. The money was enough to pay off bills and the remainder of the mortgage on my parents home. It was bitter sweet that I inherited my family home I grew up in so soon. Nonetheless it was mine now. I went through the home and went over paperwork that was left. I came across the legal paperwork for a case in which my father was awarded money. It was the case in which I received the 12 checks from. As I went through the paperwork I realized the 12 checks were just the tip of the iceberg. There were a list of payments that were to be made to my father and now to me. I was astounded. My parents had been working on this case for years. I gathered the paperwork and went all the way to the lawyer. The lawyer explained that this would be ongoing and I would receive many more payments for years to come. A week later I received 2 more checks.,39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F9F938U,,retold

She was my best friend. She was married to my father for 42 years and he was heartbroken over her death. Five months ago he died from that broken heart. I was the classic daddy’s girl. I was  such an emotional wreck over their deaths that I went into auto pilot. I was dealing with funeral, insurance companies and estate issues and was just going through the motions. I signed so much paperwork it all looked the same. It was just a part of the process. My parents loved me dearly and spoiled me greatly. They always took care of me, even as an adult. Exactly 3 weeks after his death I started receiving settlement checks in the mail from a lawsuit he had just finished. It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death. As the executor of his estate the funds went to me. I was floored. The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference. I immediately called the law firm and was explained that I had already signed the release and they had all that they needed. In  my autopilot state I signed all of the paperwork without even realizing it. And that was just the first round of checks.

We won the first two games easily without much trouble. Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals. Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half. The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point. In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee. Right away I knew it was bad. I spent a few minutes writhing around in pain before being helped off the court. I was forced to sit on the bench and ice my knee while the final minutes ticked away. Unfortunately we did not have the size on our bench to replace my height, and it cost us the chance for the championship. The final score was 85-84, and we ended up leaving with a second place trophy. After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while. Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating. My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament.

I started running towards my basket and my teammate threw me the ball. I caught it and took a couple dribbles.

I went up for a lay up with my right hand to fake my opponent, then tried to finish with my left. During the shot I had to adjust my body in a weird angle in the air so that I wouldn't get my shot blocked. Because of this I came down really hard on my right knee.

The told me continuously to start classes, to get moving on it, at times there were almost relentless about it. I could see it in their eyes, how very much they wanted me to complete my education, I felt that drive in them, that sense of pride they would have in me. Before they passed away I made a promise, to me I took an oath in their presence, that I would no matter what complete my Masters degree. They never let me forget that promise, my mother reminded me of it daily, my father talked about it often and I carried that around with me until this day. I remember sharing the story with my Daughter, the promise I made to her grandparents and what it meant to them and me. At first she could not grasp the meaning of it all to me, the sense of gratitude I had for my parents as well as what it meant to them for me to get my higher level degree. I finally got through to my daughter about how I felt, how my parents felt and how to me it tied in with her getting her Masters on the same day. She always knew how I beam with pride over her, all her accomplishments and dedication to studying.

They made sure I got good grades in school and always kept tabs on my progress. After High School, I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in engineering. During my senior year and just before entering the Master's program, my girlfriend was pregnant. I was happy because I was going to be a father but upset because I would not be able to get my Master's degree. My parents were devastated and i'm sure that they were hurt. My girlfriend and I decided to marry and raise our child before returning to school. My parents hounded me for over 20 years to finish my education. I continually put it off until one day that I promised my parents that I would go back to school. The day came when my daughter received her Bachelor's degree in Biology and we made a pact to get our Master's degree together and that we were going to do it for her Grandpa and Grandma. I told my daughter that I promised them that I would get my Masters and now that they were gone, I was even more determined to keep that promise. On the day of graduation, before the commencement, I sat in the car with my Wife and silently cried. I knew that my parents would be so proud of me. I felt good though because I knew that my daughter was going to be right by my side. We walked up on the stage together and we walked off of the stage together. I had never felt so at peace with myself. I was so proud of my daughter and I knew that 2 other people were looking down on me with the same pride.

The sun was shining, it was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. This day would be a day that would forever change my life. I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal. Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier. Due to starting a family shortly after receiving my Bachelors degree, I had put off getting my Masters until my life had settled and I was financially capable of achieving this goal. Well, that time came 2 years ago when I took the step of enrolling in school at the age of 46. Did I need the Masters degree? Would it change my life? Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful? Well, yes I did need the degree and yes it would change my life. I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family. It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it. So many emotions ran through my mind. Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here? I knew that they were looking down upon me and this day and were just as proud as they would have been if they were here to see it with their own eyes. What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering. She has always been proud of here Dad but I know that she was more excited about my graduation than hers. When my name was called, I stood up, walked up onto that stage and broke down in tears. I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me. I imagined my Mom crying and my Dad holding back tears of Joy. When I received my degree, I turned and faced my Wife and yelled: we did it!. She was overcome with emotion as well. My Daughter was next and I waited on stage for her. Upon receiving her degree, she ran to me and told me that she was proud of me.",39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MHEZMBK,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MHEZMBK,recalled

I m mostly  don't care about what other people think. hen you start and finish my presentation in a breeze,I am imagine myself being the most confident speaker during your presentations and meetings. this is where the core of my problem lies, A fear of public speaking is often  related with social anxiety and being afraid what others think, dislike being the center of attention being judged etc. the way I can beat this is firstly by believing .then reassure myself because i am going to be completely else or to present their own representations. I used to be petrified of speaking in public. once i improved I used to be petrified speaking in public. I started raising my hand o speak as often as possible. I developed a workshop. which I use o train people on how to become more comfortable mastering the skill of communicating effectively. The quick tip for today is all about structure. A lack of structure often causes a speaker to get  nervous and perform poorly. Having a clear structure accomplishes two things.  you hardly ever forget what you want to say and You give he audience a great way to stay engaged the entire time. I also know exactly where i am in the presentation and never have to worry about losing my train and thought.",3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CYA8HTI,,retold

We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real for our son knowing he would have a little sister. Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it. We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on. But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face. He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days. Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was. Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much. He is super protective over her and it's a huge relief that they like each other now.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0,imagined

It was a planned c-section after a high risk pregnancy.  I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.  This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child.  The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again.  I was also scared for the procedure.  With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery.  This time was different.  I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child.  I think my biggest concern was how my son was going to handle having a baby sister.  He was barely two.  I didn't know if he was going to be upset.  I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.  When my husband brought him to my hospital room, I wanted him to feel just as important as he always had.  My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.   My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.  He stroked her hair and said ""baby"". That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.  The whole room sighed at the cuteness of it.  Until the baby started screaming, that is.  Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped.  She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.  I had expected him to be unsure of the new baby but I never expected him to do that.  He then asked us to ""take her back, please"".  I think that was the beginning of a lifelong sibling rivalry.",3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0,,retold

It was a lot of fun. I arrived the day before the wedding. We went on a fun rafting trip that day. Afterwards, we returned to the venue and I helped set things up. The most memorable part of the event was the actual ceremony. It was set up outside with seating near a small lake. It was very lovely. I was up at the front since I was best man.

We wanted to show a formal amount of respect.  But I guess this is the way he wanted it.  It was nice to see everyone show up wearing sport jersey.  Not everyone joined in on the informal attire.  I think they felt uncomfortably overdressed.  Ha ha ha, John was probably laughing in the casket! The ceremony was nice.  We all paid our respects during the ceremony and at the grave site.

After some very unexpected health problems he passed away. Still a young man with a young family, very sad and tragic. Just a year prior he was healthy and working with a bright future. The family didn't have any church ties to speak of so his wife and family decided to have a memorial service instead of a traditional church service. Notice was given to all who knew him to come to an informal gathering where he would be remembered. His favorite sports team was the Tampa Bay Buc's and it was suggested, not required, that those who wanted to could wear their jerseys to the memorial service. Probably close to two hundred friends, family and co-workers showed up at various times to show support to his wife and celebrate his shorter than expected life. There were many in attendance wearing his favorite teams jersey though not all. They all mingled together talking about the shortness of his life and shock of being loss so young. There were tears and laughter of times when he had been and encouragement to different attendees he had worked with. It was a gloomy day, cloudy day outside with rain on an off. However, the crowd inside didn't match the outside gloom as though sad, they were celebratory and thankful for having known him as friend. We meet many we hadn't seen in sometime and all we happy to see us though not under the circumstances we came for. A speaker toward the end told of the young man's life while a video played in the background showing him in happier times. When he had finished we went forward and gave his wife a hug and expressed our shock and surprise at his death. We've seen her and the kids once since his passing and they are getting along. They miss him of course but it's one of those things in life that we encounter sometimes. Unexpected bumps in the road that you have to deal with and move on. He'll forever be in our thoughts and remind us to be thankful for those in our lives that our still with us. Good reminder to spend time with our love ones and acknowledge them while they are here. You never know when life will throw one of those bumps in your path.",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY78SVH0J,,retold

His funeral was just two weekends ago and many came to support his wife and children as they move on with life. He worked for several years in multiple departments. His smile and friendly disposition was well known and an great encouragement to many. He was known for greeting many with a smile and a ""Hi Boss,"" which many acknowledged when remembering him.  A very nice tribute to a good man, husband and father as well as a great co-worker. Though the service was for his passing it was also used as a celebration of his life and those in who came where encouraged to where casual clothes to not be so formal.

It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.  I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall. I told the staff to watch out he may be using in the bathroom.  It turned out to be true and he overdosed.  After about 30 minutes of waiting for him to emerge, they finally called the police.  He was out in the bathroom stall but still breathing.  I actually know the guy kinda which is weird well I have seen him a few times.  They were able to bring him back to life.  He was taken to treatment hopefully he sticks with it but it is very doubtful.  It is one of the problems with liberal cities.  They totally allow people to use drugs anywhere and sometimes even help them inject in some cities.  In every bathroom in portland there is a used needle trash can.  I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.  I hope that guy is ok and figures things out but that is doubtful he will be dead in a year at the rate he is going.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2BA7D9X,imagined

They said it would be a reunion . I asked what they wanted me to bring and they told some things I could bring. I asked them why were they doing it because I thought maybe my dad was sick and nobody informed me of it. He is turning ninety this year . The one cousin I asked said just to come in, I think. So it kind of worried me  that something might be wrong with him.  But they came in and a lot of people were there and we had a good time. We ate and took pictures and showed each other pictures of all our families and people in our family who had died.  It was sad because our grandparents had died and all of my cousins parents had died . There was no one left on my dad's side but him. All his brothers and sisters and their spouses were dead. We gave each other small gifts and made to go boxes of left over food for everyone and then cleaned up the kitchen. One of my cousins was a photographer and we went outside and took a lot of outdoor pictures of everyone and later he put them online for us. It was good to see everyone and it felt like when we were all kids and were at our grandparents house eating her food and seeing each other, like at Christmas or Thanksgiving.  Most of them brought the food that grandma made when we were growing up so that made it feel even more like a family reunion .  It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us. He teared up some and I think everyone else did too. It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long. It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.  We made plans to see each other again in September and I am looking forward to that . Some of them have to fly in so not sure how many will make it.  I will go to that event since it is only an hour and a half away from me and an easy drive.",3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2BA7D9X,,retold

My dad turned 90 on July 4th and he is the last  person alive on his side of the family. My grandparents came here when they were nineteen from Europe around 1911. They had three boys and one girl . I  have one whole sister and one half sister.  My dad and mom got divorced when I was sixteen. He remarried a girl much younger that was my babysitter and they had one girl. After he married her , she stopped inviting me and my sister over   and my dad would call occasionally and say come over, but when you weren't invited over for the past few years, you don't feel that invite is sincere and I didn't go. So I am not close with my half sister and we barely speak when we see each other out. My cousins parents from my dad's siblings never got divorced. So my cousins wanted to come in for my dad's 90th and they brought all kinds of food and pictures and we had a good time . Lots of pictures were taken and everything was great. I just felt that my life and relationship with my dad was very different than my cousins and they don't understand what it is like when parents get divorced and how kids can be treated because of it. I feel cheated in that respect and felt envious that they had normal childhoods and good relationships with their parents. I still talk to my dad when I see him in the local grocery store but it is just casual talk and that is kind of sad.  He is not going to be around much longer and I wish things had been different between us but I don't think it was all my fault . I think that will probably be our last family reunion .

They both were perfect from the start. The hotels, tours, and restaurant recommendations were all amazing from Rome, to Il Borro, Florence, and Sorrento. Our cooking class in Florence in Meri’s Tuscan kitchen was a highlight topped off with a full day boat tour along the Sorrento Coast, Capri Island, and Nero Bay with Giovanni and having lunch at Conca Del Sogno on our last day. It’s truly an experience we will never forget. Can’t wait to have Julie and Get Set Getaways plan our next trip” Jet Set Getaways make dreams come true. Outstanding on every level. I’ve flown over 1 Million miles in my life and traveled extensively. Julie and company are true professionals and far exceed any and all expectations. I cannot recommend high enough. Pure professionals and handle incredible details. Do yourself a favor - retain the outstanding services of Jet Set Getaways and I guarantee you will be impressed. Job well done Julie. When thinking of booking travel, three words come to mind: convenience, relaxation & luxury. When booking with JSG each of these elements has always been met & often exceeded. From the onset of booking our honeymoon, JSG was prompt to provide hotel recommendations that were matched with our desires for our trip to Greece. We stayed at the Blue Palace - Marriott Luxury Collection in Crete & The Chromata in Santorini. When we checked in, the staff pulled up our itinerary & knew what extra Virtuoso Amenities would be included, which luckily afforded an upgrade for our stays. Additionally, to our surprise, we receive a hand written letter with welcome treats & wine at each hotel! It was incredible to walk in our room & feel so special. The JSG team treats each of their clients exceptionally & personably. All details are thought of from the inception of the booking process & throughout the stay. I would highly recommend putting your trust in the JSG team to plan your next vacation!",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK471PJ8W,imagined

We both thought that this was intentional so we decided that the next day we will plan a surprise trip to Las Vegas.

The eye doctor I visited told me that I could have surgery to have my eyes realigned. He reassured me that it was a safe procedure and would greatly improve the appearance. I didn't really need much time to think it over, and I immediately signed up for an appointment scheduled for three months later. I could barely sit still during those three months because I was overcome with joy and anxiousness. Despite not being able to see on the day following my surgery, I was so thrilled to finally have this procedure done. And once everything finally healed it was absolutely unbelievable!

I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed. It has really changed my life in so many ways.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,,retold

My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,recalled

All her friends from the past were part of the ceremony and it was quite uplifting. I was glad they shortened the ceremony a bit. They had original plans to do a lot more and spend more time on ceremony type things. But in the end they just focused on things they both liked and what they knew the guests would like also. So the main focus was on food and games. Not so much the formal aspects. They had so much food to choose from. It was quite entertaining the different choices they had. So much variety in foods. It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles. Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,imagined

The first friend I spent time with at her birthday dinner at a korean BBQ place, the second friend I spent time with at her house to watch a movie. Dinner at the BBQ place was super fun and I was most surprised to see a soju tower on the house when I showed up. It was a huge tower-like container that has a switch and when you open it, soju just comes flowing out. The price of it was more than $30 so I was really surprised to see the restaurant just gave it to us on the house. I was also surprised by how many people showed up. I hadn't checked who else was coming and I was pleasantly surprised to see some friends I hadn't seen in a while. This dinner was significant to me because my friend was turning 21, an age that is pretty important to a lot of teens. It wasn't as important to me, but it was to my friend because she is quite a heavy drinker, so that made it important to me too. I had a really good time during the dinner. I was anxious at first because I wasn't sure where I would be sitting. Since my friend invited a lot of people I knew it was pretty guaranteed I wouldn't be able to sit with her. But I ended up finding a lot of people I knew and had a good time catching up with them. Afterwards I met up wit my other friend to watch a movie. This event was significant to me as well because I hadn't seen this friend in a while, and I got to see the new place she moved out to. It was the first time she was finally living on her own, and it was nice to see her slowly going into adulthood more.

A month ago I went to my friend's birthday party. We had dinner at a korean bbq restaurant. The restaurant was far away so I ended up carpooling with friends that also were going to the party. They picked me up at around 5 PM but had to make a stop at Target first because some of my friends had not bought a birthday gift yet. They ended up buying makeup for the birthday girl and a card and we were on our way. I already had bought a gift from Amazon so I did not buy anything at Target. We were one of the first people to get to the restaurant so we got to pick which table we wanted to sit at and thankfully we all got to sit together. It was interesting because my friend had invited 25 people, so many people who were invited I did not even talk to. Most of us did not even talk to the birthday girl because she was sitting at a different table from most of us. I ended up sitting with people that I knew, so it was as if I just went to go out to eat with these people for no occasion. Nevertheless, the restaurant was so good and I had good conversation. The food was expensive and so was the commute (1 hour), but I still think it was worth it. I got my friend a pusheen plushy and she seemed to really like the gift.

While I continue to look for a job, I am substitute teaching. This is not as good of a job due to financial concerns. It also sucks to not have my own classroom. You are not able to establish the same types of relationships with students that you can in your own classroom. It was surprising to me how bad the job market has been considering the news is constantly saying that there is a teacher shortage. Now I am stuck with student loans to pay.

To finally be done with my credential and master's was a huge accomplishment for me. Walking down the stage at graduation felt amazing. I realized that this was likely the last time that I would attend a graduation as a student. That is, unless I decide to go back for my doctorate degree. However, whether I decide to go back for another graduate-level degree or not, the accomplishment of getting my master's degree can never be taken away from me.

We went over to visit her often during treatments, went to the hospital when she was checked in for the initial treatments, and generally kept up a lot of support. Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her. She seemed to be handling treatment well. Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate. We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc. So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water. It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away. As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary). It was hard to post her final goodbye to friends on FB after she passed, but I did what she asked. Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources. Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support. I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney. Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well. He still needs help accessing all of the resources she left him and after his power was shut off reached out for help.

She was in the middle of her treatments, going for radiation and chemo, her hair was starting to fall out and she shaved her head. My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything. She lived with her grandson, who is 23. He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life. One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke. She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this. We went to visit her a few times in the hospital. My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power. She was not going to come back and be herself. She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really. She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond. She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken. So the decision was made to let her go. It was sad that she died this way, and so soon. We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke.

The only thing bad about it was the name. It was beautiful. It's almost overwhelming how much there was to view. But it was so special. I felt like I was connected to everything and everyone.

I think the reason we all enjoyed it so much is because it was something that my parents, myself, and my young children all could enjoy together. The beauty was amazing, and he wildlife and natural land forms were something so very different than we had ever experienced before. We were able to observe American Bison on the prairie. The sheer size of the creatures is what stands out in my memory to this day. My children still talk about the bison, and we have included studying these animals during our homeschooling days. We also saw huge eagles and hawks! The wildlife that my children probably enjoyed the most were the prairie dogs, as they were able to get fairly close to them! The vast rock formations, and huge canyon was amazing. It was like a giant bowl in the middle of the prairie! We learned about the formation of the rocks, and you could see the different layers of sediment in the rocks. We spent the greater part of a day just exploring the different areas, pulling off at all of the scenic outlooks! It was an amazing family memory! I can't wait to go back when my wife and oldest son can join us!",3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88MPSTMH,,retold

The rock formations were stunning, and We took many photos. This event was particularly special to me, because I have wanted to visit this park since I Was a little girl. A teacher shared pictures of her own vacation with me, and from that moment on, I have wanted to visit.  My visit was everything I have always imagined and more! My family and I saw American Bison, prairie dogs, Big Horn Sheep, and so many birds! One of the most exciting moments was when my children were able to get very close to a prairie dog for a picture! The sun was so hot that day, but there was a nice breeze over the prairie. My children and I climbed a couple of large rock formations together, and the view from the top was spectacular!

The anxiousness and anxiety it caused was not good. It kept me from sleeping or focusing well, and also from working. I worried - will I need to take more pain medicine? Will the infection return? Thankfully, with full rest, mouth rinse, and a positive outlook, the pain was no more. Now, I make sure to rinse daily with this unique mouth wash and so far it's been pretty positive. Also of note, I ended up making up my work and being given reduced hours, which helped me make up the amount of money lost. The doctor at the Urgent Care Center stated it appeared to be an infection resulting from impacted wisdom teeth. Wisdom Teeth come in around 17 years of age, or start to and eventually become impacted. Impaction leads to vision problems, pain, on site infection, and shifting teeth among other things. I have experienced some pain for years over this, but only recently, has it become so bad that it incapacitates me.

This pain radiated in my jaw, teeth, and neck, but was not the ordinary tooth or molar pain. It was intense, extreme, unbearable. Nothing would help it, not over the counter medications, or rest. It was an intense, tremoring pain --- the kind you'd experience during a boxing match or worse, during surgery without numbing. Being that I suffer from anxiety and am getting up there in age, I began to worry. Was this very serious? I contemplated my options all the while suffering. Do I go to the ER? A local Urgent Care? I tried everything I could think of to numb the pain. It was almost as if I was bitten by a poisonous creature. Was it a spider bite? So many things raced through my mind. Eventually, I realized the inside of my mouth was irritated. This was possibly from spicy food or acid reflux, and that it appeared to be possibly infected.

The ups, the downs and everything in between. My beautiful bride and I have been married for two years now. Our anniversary is tomorrow and we're going on a fabulous date of dinner around Newport Harbor. As I reflect back, I think to how nervous I was to even ask her to marry me. I bought the ring five months before I actually asked her. I practiced what I would say for months and just couldn't work up the nerve. Finally, after all that, I popped the question. I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. And she said yes! She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn. We got married just one month later and the most beautiful service ever. We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Everyone was there, our parents, our friends and even Elvis made an apppearance! We stayed the Mirage just up the street and just had the most wonderful time. The last two years have just been so amazing, I can't wait to see what the future holds.",,3H8DHMCCWAXBUI33JIX2ZIYIWF9KDK,imagined

We found out that we enjoy a lot of the same things and are able to enjoy them together.  We also have a son who we love very much and enjoy taking him to enjoy our hobbies and passions together as a family. The evening was her birthday and I got home just as the delivery man was leaving with the ring.  It was too expensive to leave on the porch so he had to leave a note and I missed him the day before.  But not today I was able to get the ring.  I needed it that night to ask her to marry me as well.  So with the ring nervously in my pocket we went to dinner and I dont think she even knew.  It finally came time to ask her and people were seemingly ready to leave.  So I had to do it.  I had to finally ask her or I'd have to find another time and be super nervous all over again.  She said yes!  We were pretty happy to share the moment with my family, her family and our son.  The resturant printed off the menu for us and it said congrats to us. We are now very happy together and have been able to share things equally.  We live together and share expenses and those things are working out great.

I think I got very lucky.  The night I proposed I was very nervous and was not able to eat my food much at all which people at our table thought that in itself was very strange.  It was on her birthday and we decided to go to the resturant where we went on our first date at.  We invited my parents, our son was there, and her family.  We had a good time and I finally pulled out the ring to put it on my pinky so it was ready.  My dad was getting anxious and was ready to leave until I showed him the ring under the table.  He was then relaxed and thought I should get on with it.  So, I just simply asked, didnt get down on one knee or anything, but offered it to her and myself.  She said yes!

He looked at me and winked with a glimmer in his eyes, a look that said it all. The long hours of studying all these years have finally paid off and he is finally graduating. The road up until here was not an easy one but we made it. The graduation ceremony took place in the arena in the city and was as grand as you could imagine. The arena was prepared for a prestigeous ceremony with attendees from prestigeous educational backgrounds. It really was a day to remember. The commencement speeches started and we were impatiently waiting for them to hand out the certificates to the graduates. My phones camera was on full blast along with our digital camera and video camera. My husband and kids and family was all there and cheering when they called his name and as he walked up to the stage to receive his degree we all went wild with cheers and hollers. He looked up at us in the stand and smiled and waved as we screamed our excitement. he took his degree and proudly walked back to his seat. This is what we had all been waiting for all these years. The celebration of achievement is a celebration like no other. I hope that every parent gets to feel this feeling of pride and love of their childs achievements.",,3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5,imagined

I can precisely picture everything about my surroundings that night. I am usually not that great at taking everything in and focus on small details in my life and at events as opposed to the big picture. This night, however, I can clearly recall the view across the room, the colors, the sounds, the whole entirety of it all, and most importantly, the feelings. I know I could go back to that huge room and find the seat I was sitting in among thousands just based on the clarity of my memory. I took everything in. Before the graduation, I had trouble finding parking and rushed into the venue at the last moment, worried I wouldn't be able to find a seat. I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available. At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not. He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was. Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away. In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant. The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt. In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night. As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through. Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me. With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes. I will never forget the look he had on his face. It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility. Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared. Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words.",3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5,,retold

We spent the night there before boarding the ship. The cruise lasted for one week and included stops in Spain, France, and Italy. We went on excursions almost every day. The weather was very hot, as there was a heat wave in Europe. The buses we took for excursions had very little air conditioning, making the trips miserably hot. In general, we had fun, however the days were very long and tiring. The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip. We had many food allergies in the group, and they did not do a good job accommodating. I've been on other cruises where they over accommodated for allergies, but this ship did not meet those expectations.

I traveled with my husband and 10 of his family members to Barcelona, Spain. We left Barcelona for a one-week Mediterranean cruise.  On the cruise, we made stops in Italy, France, and Spain.  This was a memorable vacation because it celebrated my in-laws 55th wedding anniversary.  It was great to see the whole family and be together. We all live in different parts of the country, so it is rare that we are all together at one time. We had a lot of fun with nieces and nephews who are growing up quickly. Our niece also turned 13 on the cruise, and for her birthday my husband and I took her bowling on the boat. She was so excited and happy to go with us. I will remember that moment. There were a lot of downsides to the cruise.  Things like the oppressive heat, bad food, etc. contributed to a somewhat negative experience.

I’ve been trying to raise my kids with the same values that were instilled in me, so four months ago, I brought my daughter along for our charity food truck run.	We were just going to drop off some canned goods and a few baked goods my wife baked, but my daughter took it one step further. She wanted to get some plastic eggs and fill them with Easter candy to hand out along with the food. Bless her heart. I know people say that teenagers only care for themselves, but she’s such a good girl.	So, we did exactly that. On the way to the shelter, we picked up some eggs and candy, only a few dozen or so. We sat right in the back of the truck and individually placed candy in each egg. We grabbed a couple of baskets, plopped the eggs in, and drove on over.	I couldn’t believe the affect that such a simple, inexpensive gesture would have on these folks. I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other. Even she wept at seeing how it made them feel.	I couldn’t thank my daughter enough for reminding me of this lesson, something so simple that I truly forgot it. It took the little bit of compassion from a teenager to remind me why I do these kinds of things. And they say teenagers only care about themselves… She’s a good egg.",,3I7DHKZYGOM5AJWW31OMLTILC4GF5W,imagined

I came up with a few suggestions that were roundly rejected by my very moody teenage daughter. Frustrated, I suggested that she come up with some ideas, then. She went up to her room with stomps in the place of footsteps. Thinking she would summarily forget the task, I decided to go with my first idea of making hard boiled eggs and dyeing them as a family. But soon, my daughter came down the stairs (much lighter this time). She wanted to put mini-chocolate bars in plastic eggs and deliver them with the sandwiches.  So we purchased 135 plastic eggs and chocolates and then my daughter, son, husband, and I assembled them to go with the food. The next day, as we made our deliveries, I watched my daughter's face with as much fascination as I watched the faces of our homeless friends as they opened their eggs. Delight and happiness lit up the faces of the homeless as they found their ""surprises.""And as she watched, joyful tears slipped onto my daughter's cheeks. She tried not to let me or my husband see.

I always knew they would get married but it was still kinda surprising and emotional when they announced it.  The wedding itself was just a small family affair that happened at the court house with a celebration afterwards.  She wanted it like that and I was fine with it too.  It was less planning and fanfare which is more her style.  One of the best things about this wedding is that my son came and he and my daughter got to be reunited with each other.  They've been arguing and hostile with each other for the past five years so this was kinda a big deal.  I was so glad to see them finally reconcile with each other because it's been a huge strain for me having them fighting with each other.  It makes it hard because neither will come to family get togethers like Christmas if they know the other is there and this makes me so sad.  I want the whole family together and it's just not the same if one is not there.  So this was a big deal to me and made the wedding all the more meaningful.  I didn't know that my son was going to come and actually I expected him not to, so I was really surprised when he showed up.  I saw him talking to my daughter later that night at our house and I expected it to get heated but to my surprise they were laughing and smiling.  Turns out from what he told me later they both apologized to each other and decided life was too short to continue arguing.  I am so glad and warmed in my heart that they have made up with each other.  It was tearing my heart apart that they had tension with each other and now I feel so much better.  I just hope they can continue getting along and don't fall back into that horrible state again.  Now I can't wait to become a grandmother.",,3IAS3U3I0G2NY51TGG0S4WOO2JL2BN,imagined

I was so proud of her. And I was proud to be there. Honestly, the best part though was that my daughter and son reconnected. She asked him to be a witness. It was a big thing to do.

I started putting up feeders around to see some of the nature. For the first few weeks I got nothing and no activity, then about a month ago animals came. Mostly squirrels at first and a few deer, and one tiny humming bird. I was out misting the peonies and the bird kept flitting in and out of the hose. I moved the hose and the bird moved too. Eventually i got a chair and just sat spraying the mist and letting the bird flutter around. They are incredibly beautiful creatures and also very small. I worried i might get it too wet to fly but that didnt happen. I was happy the bird was there and it seemed happy to be getting misted. It was a wonderful moment of man and nature coming together. As the bird flew away I smiled and hoped he would be back again. So far i havent seen him but i will remember the simple joy i got that morning. I am glad i could provide for nature and enjoy moments like that. I hope everyone can take some time to enjoy the little things in life.",,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,imagined

I was watering the plants, vegetables, and Cacti. I was feel kind of low due to not seeing many of my friends anymore due to everyone being busy with their own schedule, and work being a little slow was also on my mind. I may have been feeling sorry for myself, but the wounds were real. As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird. At first I thought he was just doing his early morning pollen rituals, but to my surprise he wanted water. The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose. I turned down the pressure of the hose to a fine mist and pointed the mist into the direction of the humming bird . The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time. If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream. It was great the bird had no fear of animosity of a human. He knew there was a human controlling the hose and he did not care he wanted water on this warm summer day. I felt great, I felt a connection with this little bird, we at this brief aquatic encounter were friends. It seemed that God saw my loneliness and sent me a friend. That small communal moment with nature make me feel better for the rest of the day. I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,recalled

This was until he and my mom unfortunately got divorced. He still tried to be there for me but life got in the way. He and I drifted apart over time. So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago. I said how good it was to hear from him, and we updated each other on some of the new mundane things in our lives. He also told me about his health, which he's had issues with at times, but on the whole things are going pretty well for him especially considering he's in his 70s. I shared news about my own health which has also had some bumps in the road. He told me he has a new wife who he said is great and he's very happy being with. The memorable and rather shocking part of the story was when that my step-dad told me his younger sister had died (only in her 50s) far too soon from cancer. I was really quite sad and taken aback by this. It brought up a lot of memories from my childhood of staying over at her house and how nice she was. I of course tried my best to offer my condolences and sympathy. It was a nice conversation and moving experience that lasted about half an hour. At the end of the call we expressed intent to stay in touch, which we have. It's been good to have him back in my life even in just a small way.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ55D9UC,,retold

An unfortunate thing I found out while talking to him was that his younger sister passed away from cancer. It was very sad to hear this as I remember her well from my childhood. I also know they were very close to one another so I tried to console him the best that I could.

I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.  I'm such a procrastinator!  My best friend and I were on our way to see my favorite band, Highly Suspect, perform at the Amphitheater when I heard my phone ringing from the depths of my purse.  I almost didn't answer it because I was driving and all that, but my best friend fished it out of the abyss for me.  I am SO glad I took the call!  It was an automated call from the local rock station I listen to religiously on my way to and from work, telling me I had won a trip to Las Vegas.  They have a web page where you can enter-for-a-chance-to-win stuff like T-shirts, concert tickets and vacations (obviously).  I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests.  I was so excited when I got that call, having never been to Las Vegas, that I immediately called the radio station.  I almost thought it wasn't real.  The lady who answered the phone assured me that if I had gotten the automated call I had definitely won the trip.  She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold.  When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!  I had actually won a trip to Mexico.  This excited me even more, because I've always wanted to go to Mexico.  It was the most amazing trip and I will forever remember it!",,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ8TVU9U,imagined

Okay so I was traveling across the country to create a life with the love of my life in a state I never lived in. Big jump! I wasn't gonna leave my son (Rocky the Turtle) behind. Can't drive so, hopefully airplane security will be cool with a turtle. He's a real charmer, so while TSA was skeptical when I first explained the situation, the moment the box opened and Rockso went to say hi to this new exciting person, they were captivated. Got to skip the x ray imagers, but they still had to swab him down for potential explosives. Or drugs? I guess he's just that HOT looking haha. But really. They swabbed him down, found nothing of course, and then we were off to wait for the airplane. Rocky was NOT a fan of the box by the way. He would shuffle around and try to dig his way into the paper towels I laid down for the trip whenever the box was closed. When it was open, however, he'd chill and peek his lil turtley head up and out, taking in the sights. He got to meet several curious travelers including one delighted lil toddler whose mother was v charmed by my personable lil guy. This was only between planes, however. Could not open the box and take him out midflight. Seemed risky, didn't want him getting loose and causing a panic, or even worse, getting hurt. He was tucked under the seat in front of me the entire flight, and all you could hear was occasional little flurries of scrapes as he tried to burrow his way out of the box to freedom.",3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ2EVAG5,,retold

He did get to meet the TSA, who allowed him to bypass the x ray machine. (I was worried about health effects for my boy!) But they had to check his box, and insisted on swabbing it for explosives. Or maybe drugs? They found none, of course, except the ADDICTIVE AND EXPLOSIVELY CUTE personality of my turt. He charmed the TSA instantly and though they finished swabbing within a minute, they spent five or six cooing over my boy. Once in the terminal, he continued to charm my fellow passengers, and got a lot of pets. The rest of the trip was less eventful. He'd attempt to burrow his way out every once in a while, but I let him peek out whenever I was sitting between flights, and the new sights and smells seemed to satisfy some curiosity. It was only when the box was closed that he tried to dig his way to freedom. Once we got to our new home, he sulked in a corner of his tank for a week.

After much research I wound up agreeing to go dog mushing around the interior of Alaska with a native of the area. I was nervous for sure, but it sounded like the chance of a lifetime. I needed to break from reality badly. I had been working 7 days a week for months and felt like my brain was about to explode. After a few days of riding around the lonely outskirts of Alaska I really started to feel better. I stopped thinking about work. My mind totally cleared and for the first time in forever I really felt at peace. The scenery in Alaska is amazing. It is hard to explain. It is so plain and vacant, but is is beautiful. It looks untouched, like no one has been around to destroy it like the rest of the world. My favorite moment of the entire trip was when we took a short break to let the dogs rest. I was sitting in the snow and I looked over and saw 2 moose walking across the ice. I had never seen a moose up close, it was breathtaking.

We took off on our normal training run and the dogs were extremely focused.  I had my go-pro rolling since the day was so beautiful and i wanted to capture the openness of crossing the river on such a bright day.  We ran without a break until we got to the river and i could tell the dogs were getting tired.  We took a break right before the downhill to cross the river and when i looked up i noticed a moose just across the bank.  The dogs were so tired they didn't even notice, the more i watched this big cow moose eat off the trees i noticed a calf emerge from the woods behind her.  I watched in amazement as i always did when i saw moose, now was my chance to be quiet and watch because they hadn't seen me yet.  While i was watching the moose i heard a scream not too far off which sounded like a cat, and indeed it was.  Only 45-50 yards away from the moose was a full grown lynx walking the bank of the river.  Lynx are extremely rare to see in the wild and i was excited.  I couldn't believe that the dogs had not made a sound at this point, but they typically didn't during a needed rest.  Just when i thought this free nature show couldn't get any better a second lynx walked out from the woods and began a mating call with the first lynx.  I listened to them and watched them walk the bank for what seemed like and hour.  I have never seen anything so great and beautiful from nature and probably never will.

I hate her for asking the question. Why should i let her see them why should they know her has she earned the right?  There are people that say you should forgive and forget . Im not one of those people I fell you should never forget especially when a person refuses to give you closure. I remember I asked her one year about my childhood and she said God has already forgiven me for the things that have happened to you. I stood there shocked thinking well dont you think you should want forgiveness from me too. But of course I got nothing not even a sorry . So no she will not be able to see my kids.  Just so they should be come attached and  maybe become victims of the same abuse I did. That would make me a responsible. Because I Know what she is capable of. Even if others are fooled by her sweetness. She always talkes about chursh and loving god but where was that love when i was little. Surely god saw what you did to me . Surely he say how you treated me didnt you care a bout his approval then. I wish I wasnt so bitter.,3L4D84MIL0EXVE2NNTGGPOD3072HJW,,retold

Moving away from my hometown was a crazy change, and it's hard to believe I actually went through with it. Most people don't. Ultimately though I was just too bored in my hometown. Seeing the same friends at the same places while drinking and eating the same things just grows so tiresome. At least for me anyway. It was my snoozefest of a desk job that forced me to pack up and head across the country for a new life, but the dull familiarity of the area was a big reason too. I needed a change in the worst way. I probably should give myself more credit for actually pulling such a change off too. Even if that change means starting at the bottom at a new job and living in a tiny apartment. But it's new and it's fresh, and that's the significant part. I have a whole new area to explore here out west, and the weather here makes back home feel like Russia. I know some of my friends are already thinking about coming to visit for a weekend or so. In a way I don't want them out here, but I would certainly like to see them eventually. This new life has the potential to really let me grow in ways that I never could back home, so I'm just pumped about getting to blaze my own trail at this point in my life.",,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUY72GL1,imagined

I felt stagnant in Ohio, while at the same time I was interested in a woman I had met nearly 40 years ago when we both shared out first kiss when we were both 13.   I had a stroke 2 years ago, and was now retired. I found that I had no contact with my old friends anymore, and was hating the northern weather. At this same time I had been talking to my first kiss when I was quite young. She was/is very beautiful and very nice. I was shocked that she had been single for almost 12 years. It didn't sound like a horrible idea moving down to Daytona Beach Florida from Cleveland Ohio either. The weather would be perfect, the ocean was near, and the chance for romance spurned me on.   As good as I planned this trip from January to July, everything convinced me that this was a great move for me. I had a furnished mobile home awaiting me, the lady I was interested lived very near where I would me, and money would be plentiful for my happiness.   But, then everything that could've gone wrong did. I had 4 goodbye evenings planned to say goodbye to people I knew in Ohio. Practically noone showed up at any of them. I did manage to give some things to a couple friends that were very good momentos of my life. And I gave, sold, or left behind all my furniture as I was just moving myself and my 2 cats down to Florida in my car. Just some few momentos and my clothes were all I took. And then things got worse.........   When I got down to Florida, I found out that I'd been scammed by the person that said they had a mobile home for me to rent. THERE WAS NO FURNISHED HOME! Talk about being floored! I had to stay and pay for a motel room at first (that the landlord said she would cover.) After finding out about the scam, I booked myself into a cheaper (yet expensive) Airbnb while I tried to figure out where to stay. During all this, the woman I came down to see said she didn't want a romance, and that she just wanted a friendly platonic thing. (This after  talking to her for over 2 years over the phone.

I then was placed on disability social security and suddenly found myself retired. Luckily, I just lost some use of my legs and went blind in my left eye, but better than those that suffered far worse then I.     Within this time, I became reacquainted with my very first kiss 48 years earlier. Her name was Debbie. While talking with her on New Year's Day 2019, she mentioned she was lonely, as was I. She said she was very single and living with her son in Daytona Beach Florida and invited me down (I lived in a suburb of Cleveland Ohio at the time.)      I planned to visit her, as I was nearing the end of my operations, and pretty sick of Northern winter weather. So, I visited this woman I had not seen in 48 years in April of this year. I was shocked that she wanted to see me the entire time I was there, but dismayed I didn't get our second kiss. I found and find her very attractive still.     When I got back up north, I still played in my mind the idea of moving down to Daytona Beach. My life as I knew it, was over in Ohio. No job, no children, friends were far gone. Thus, I took a big chance and decided to move down.     I found a home in June of 2019, that sounded great! It was furnished and the cost was affordable, thus I decided on it, and began to throw away all my furniture and everthing else from my long past.     When I finally moved down in late July of 2019, I got here and found that I was a victim of an internet scam by the woman selling me a place to live. There was no house. I had to live in a Motel 6 and an Airbnb until I could borrow money from my sister to find a home. The move itself now cost me $2000 and I have no furniture, forks, knives, dishes, pots, pans.....well I had nothing to put into it.     And it took me until the 3rd week of August to move in, and then I find out that a Hurricane is currently headed straight for Daytona Beach right now. And the relationship with Debbie is more of a friend thing than a romantic one I was hoping for. But, I plan to now make this my home and see what happens.",3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUY72GL1,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUY72GL1,recalled

It was soooo beautiful! We hiked many of the trails, including the ""Narrows"", which was killer, but really awesome. We even saw some wild animals, which was so cool and unexpected! It was so nice to be out in fresh air and to just clear my thoughts. We ate at a few great restaurants too. I love me some good food! And shopping was also fantastic.

The bus was helpful, since the weather was overcast and rainy. Due to the rain, we had less of a selection of trails, but we still made the most of the trip. After we unpacked all of our things, we went into town to shop and explore the area. We ate at one of the restaurants, got a trail guide, and explored a few of the shops. The next day we took the bus to the trails at Zion National park. We hiked along beautiful trails with waterfalls, plant life, and animals. My favorite trails went right up to the waterfalls. We also visited the nature center, and learned about the wildlife and history of the park. After hiking, we went back into town and relaxed.

Also, the bus ride up to the trails was fascinating, especially seeing the variety of different locations. After our days in the park, we headed into town to check out the shops.

This threw the family into chaos. Three months ago, things really changed. My son had to move in with my husband and I. My infant granddaughter also moved in. Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own. I love her dearly and want nothing but the best for her, but it is hard. This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions. Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?  I want to believe people can change, and I want to believe that someday my son and his family can care for her needs, but I am unsure. This has been one of the hardest times in my life.

Although, There are a number of critical breakthroughs that your infant will reach early in life. From straightforward assignments like sitting up or lifting their head to more progressed developments like rolling over, these small accomplishments are continuously inspiring. But there’s nothing very like seeing your baby crawling for the primary time. Many guardians are on edge to see their child crawl and closely screen their baby’s improvements. Of course, there’s completely nothing off-base with that! In any case, it’s vital to keep in mind that all babies are diverse and take after a distinctive advancement path. Most babies begin to crawl somewhere between 6 and 10 months of age. my baby started crawling at 8 months of age.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00UGJ,imagined

My son is now much more mobile and active than he was when I last wrote about this. He is walking around (while holding onto things) and climbing all over everything. He is opening cabinets and drawers and taking things out to play with them. He is quite a handful now. His personality is even more apparent and he is able to process and display more complex thoughts and emotions. We are much more social with each other now. talking and playing have a lot more significance now. He has grown so much in the last few months. It is clear that at this stage, his growth is faster than it has ever been. I assume that his growth will continue to accelerate until we can't even keep up with him anymore. Enough time has passed that I am beginning to miss when he was smaller because of the simplicity we had in our lives, but I love watching him learn and grow up. I look forward to seeing him start to walk on his own. I am also excited for his first word. It will be great when we can communicate meaningfully with each other. I also am looking forward to when he can hold a bottle up all by himself.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00UGJ,,retold

He is growing so fast and I am so proud of every little accomplishment he achieves. I enjoy watching him play with the cat and the dog. We have had to move a lot of things to higher places that he cannot reach. I had to redo my home theatre system because he kept pushing buttons that I did not want him to press. I am willing to do the extra work around the house so that he has a safe and functional environment to play and learn in. I am lucky enough to work from home so I get to be around him all the time. It is great to be able to spend so much time with him and help him learn and develop his skills. I look forward to the day that he takes his next step and begins to walk.

I now sleep in the same park where once I stood looking lovingly at the green earth, the trees, the birds sweetly fluttering.

No one ""lied"" to me, but the American Dream, at least for myself, was filled with untruths. The idea, of course, if that if you go to college, get married, have kids, buy a house...etc, that you will experience a life full of joy. A short time ago though I realized that this was not the life for me. Of course I realized this too late. I already have a wife, kids, house and lots of college debt. I now spend my days working to pay interest to the same people who probably made up the story on how to be happy. So, in need of some relief, I traveled to south Florida to see an old friend. We talked - for hours - about the true meaning of life, its purpose, and what to do when you are unhappy. Some people say that if you are not happy in life, change it. Find another job. Move. However, if you are already in the society trap of the American Dream, escape is not so easy. Well, at least not if you have a conscious. There is a scene in the movie ""Office Space"" that really strikes home. In a moment of clarity, Peter, the main character, tell his psychologist that each day he wakes up is the worst day of his life. I feel him. My memorable event was not something that happened ""to me,"" but an awakening inside me. I now find myself thinking about this each day, planning how I might change things, trying to find the courage to become the person I want to be, to live the life I have always wanted. Too bad I have been living the life others told me would make me happy.",3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMTNVMJ,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTMTNVMJ,recalled

It was such a beautiful day, and I was & still am so happy that she found her person. But I can't help but feel a bit of residual stress as I think over how I almost ruined it for her. Maybe that's dramatic, but I felt like I was ruining things when I spilled my champagne down the front of my bridesmaid's gown when she was counting on me to just show up and be presentable. Of course,  she wasn't mad at me in the end (maybe that's because we got it cleaned up), but the stress and embarrassment I felt was crazy. I haven't been to many big events like that lately, and I was freaking out. As if standing up in front of all those people wasn't enough pressure. Now, I thought, I'd have to either do it with a giant wet stain down my front, or change and be the only person in the wedding party wearing old, ripped jeans. I even thought, for a moment, about just sitting the whole thing out. But of course, that would've also ruined it because of how we'd rehearsed everything and I had to walk with a groomsman. Luckily, our wonderful grandma made it to the wedding that day. Leave it to an old-timer to know all the secret tricks for getting stains out. It took her no time at all to make my dress good as new, and the weight just instantly lifted off my chest. I know it's probably not as big of a deal as I make it out to be, but I've always been prone to anxiety. My cousin is so important to me and I just couldn't stand the thought of ruining her big day. She's waited so long for it. Thankfully, it all went according to plan and she's got perfect, champagne-stain-free photos to look back on and remember forever. I'm so happy it all worked out in the end.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJ2N44GN,imagined

My cousin looked gorgeous and everything was set to go. We were all having fun beforehand and drinking champagne. There was a lot of people in a tight space, so, I bumped into someone and spilled champagne entirely down my blush gown! I panicked and felt terrible. I was so scared that I ruined the dress and the day.  We called my Aunt to come in and she immediately had me take off the dress. She cleaned up the stain somehow. After that, she held the dress under a dryer. Miraculously, the stain came out and it dried in time. After that, we walked down the aisle and no one could tell! The wedding went on without a hitch.

I always love to observe art on the streets or in museums but 3 weeks ago I got to have a very cool art experience. Many neighbors came together to paint a mural in the middle of the intersection. It was my first time to pain on a street and the first time to paint a ten foot manatee. We chose the manatee because it is the elementary school's mascot. It was also a great way to get the kids involved. I learned about how to paint on the street and make sure it isn't easily washed out. This was a really great experience for me because I paint often. I am no master artist or anything but I think this experience has given me a huge burst of inspiration. I do not think I will start creating graffiti or anything but I might start using different tools. My choice paint is watercolor because of how delicate it is and soft and beautiful the strokes come out. It takes patience because what appears when you paint, and what comes out when it dries are two different images. What I love about painting the street is that it is easy to just make corrections immediately without having to wait much. This was a great experience that opened my eyes to new things. I think I may try using acrylics next time I am in front of the canvas.",,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,imagined

I soon finished with the help of others the sun beams. I then noticed the manatee. I mixed some paint and started to paint it. A young girl was wanting to help paint too so I offered to share the manatee. I directed her to where the paint and brushes were located. She had a great time helping. I had to re-paint the lines that outlined the manatee since they were a little off.

I had decided to volunteer to help paint. I signed up for the morning shift and arrived a bit early.  They had started to paint the street with primer for where the design would be painted. While I waited for that to be finished, I signed in so that the city could keep track of the amount of volunteer hours that everyone preformed. I then was instructed to have some of the donuts and water that had been brought. As I ate my donut, I noticed a couple chickens crossing the road. I was told that they lived on the block. I went back to get my camera and take a few pictures of the chickens and the beginning of the artwork. I finished taking the pictures and they were ready for me to start helping. I found a paint roller and chose to start with painting the yellow rays of sunlight. It took a couple hours but it looked great. I had wanted to paint a part of the mural that I could come back and say, I did that. I decided to paint the manatee. It had already been drawn so I got the grey paint mixed and started to paint it. A young girl, who was visiting the neighborhood, asked to help paint. I directed her to where there were more paint brushes and she soon came back. It was a fun time painting the manatee. The outline of the manatee looked really bad at this point, so I got some black paint and went over the entire outline having to change some of what we had previously painted. When I was finished with the outline, it looked great and everyone was really happy with it. I then took a picture of it and went home happily knowing that there was a manatee painted on that street by me.",3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976G74VP81,recalled

Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long.  I knew that I probably had an infection, and I did.  I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then.  Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.  It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.  I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.  The doctor had treated my infection but I suspected that I needed a therapist at this point.  Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QUCVEIA,imagined

My primary doctor gave my phone number to the best specialist at the hospital. Then it took like a week to hear back from the people who schedule appointments at the hospital. It was a matter of me going to hospital to see why they hadn't called me, when my primary doctor said that someone from the hospital would. It took weeks to see a urinary specialist. I don't know the exact length, but i had to wait a couple of weeks just so he can hear my side of the story and see what steps he can take with me. I went to my first visit with the urinary specialist on July 27, now i'm going back to see him tomorrow (August 27, 2019). After my first visit with the urine specialist, he gave me a 2 week supply of blue/purple pills that said that these pills might cure me and get me back to normal. But it didn't. I took them and turned my pee to a blue color, which on the package, it said that it was normal. But it didn't cure my frequent urination, which is what i'm going through right now. I wish the health care industry in america would be a lot more efficient and not have someone that is poor and not a lot of money have them wait an eternity for treatment. But, i am going to see him tomorrow, that is what is important. What the urinary specialist told me was they're going to ultra sound my kidneys. Then they're going to look inside my urine hole while i'm under anesthesia. I'm hoping this will end good, not bad. Hope for a speedy recovery, so i can go back to work like i used to 2 years ago.",3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QUCVEIA,,retold

If i didn't go the bathroom once my body called for, my urinary tract would start hurting. I never had pain like this in my urinary tract before. I couldn't/can't do the normal things i once did. Like go on a run for 30 minutes because i would be wanting to urgently go the bathroom in between my run. I went to the my annual physical doctor and she didn't know what kind of treatment i needed. She referred me to someone else. Like passing the baton on to someone else. Anyways, I thought my frequency to go to the bathroom would go away with eating fruits and vegetables, but it didn't.

Sad to say, I know. I was realistic about it. I was logical.  Weirdly so, while I was realistic about it, I felt that I was also in denial about many things. It took a very long time to realize who she really was and what her intentions were. I still remember the time when it dawned on me, all that she had done to me. I remember it all sinking in. I was disappointed. It was hurtful. I genuinely cared for her and it was obvious to me that it wasn't really reciprocal. She was selfish for a very long time. I didn't think cutting her out of my life would lead to her demise. I am not even sure that's what caused it.  Maybe the timing was just a coincidence. I knew cutting her out of my life would hurt her. I never imagined it would cause her life to unravel. Again, I don't even know if me cutting her out of my life was what caused her life to unravel. I imagine it played somewhat of a role, though. When my grandparents sat me down and described how she had hit rock bottom just a week ago, I was shocked. I don't really know why I was shocked, though. She never really was on the right track in life. Her alcoholism finally caught up with her.

So then what happens to the family? The wife states that she is going to divorce him, yet can't bring herself to actually do it. You have a husband who is stuck in no man's land. The husband will not file for divorce. Which puts the family in a trap that no one can seem to get out of. The parents are separated, the family is separated, do they still do things together. No one can seem to move forwards together or a part. It is a family in crisis, that they can't seem to get out of. So where does this family go from here? And how can this family move on, when 1 person wants nothing but reconciliation and the other person can't make up their mind. And in the middle of this, are two kid's who just want their family back together.",3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIDM1EBF7,,retold

It's always been stressful yet rewarding for me over the thousands of hours I have played in this game but my last week's game stands out than the rest. I picked Crystal Maiden as my hero and I went with another person who played a carry Slark at the bottom lane. My lane partner was very vocal on the team chat on how I am very inefficient and was stealing his experience points in the game. He did say something about how ""noob"" I am and grew more and more frustrated minute by minute. He was killed multiple times in the early game and of course, I was blamed for it. I did not let his words be a distraction nor a way to just give up and surrender. Even though I had a mic, I stayed quiet and just typed ""I'm sorry"" on chat whenever he screamed at me. Our towers are down but I kept optimistic on winning. Even though he was being angry at me and whenever I made I mistake I get bullied by him, he also never gave up and continued gaining experience and gold necessary for his hero to be powerful. The first time the enemy made a mistake and we won a team fight, I immediately congratulated our team for the great play and my other teammates were all audibly optimistic as well. Our carry Slark at this point has considerably limited his verbal abuse and I was sure that he will cooperate once he realized we were all there to win the game. The enemy had many more mistakes after that and we had a very satisfying comeback. I would always commend and rate positively my teammates whenever I win, so I did it as well with Slark. I was surprised that he did commend me back and got a friend request from him after the game. I did accept his friend requests and we've been playing a few more games to this day. I actually quite like his company and we enjoy our in-game banter and he actually jokes a lot with me now.",,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,imagined

Now, Sam is a bit on the husky side, but that is truly his only downfall.  He is incredibly smart and gives all tasks his all.  He is super friendly, and kind of Ferdinand in that he doesn't like using his size to hurt others.  He also is home schooled, because as a parent, I am worried about bullying and the other social factors that cause students to become sidetracked from their studies and lead to emotional problems.  In any event, when Sam began playing football, he began with a group of kids that already had been playing together for years and also went to school together and lived in the same neighborhood.  He had made some friends, but this core group of kids was hard to crack - especially since Sam had no previous football experience AND the coaches were all father's of this golden crew. Sam was having an especially tough practice, and was confused about the instruction of a particular play - and finally angry because on day 7 Sam didn't know what in the heck a touch back, left tackle was or the different rules that apply to offense and defense yet.  The coaches son said some incredibly hateful things to Sam behind his back, but loudly enough  so that Sam could hear.  He was crying and so upset when all of those kids laughed and picked on him all practice.  I briefly spoke to the coach who did NOTHING but say it was FOOTBALL and to toughen up.  I talked to Sam, and he decided to stay.  He seemed a little off that day, but worked hard and had all the plays figured out as he had studied up the night before.  When it came time to scrimmage the other 3rd and 4th grade team, they SHOULD have demolished them,  but since Sam was a left tackle and his job was to protect the punk that had been treating him like crap - he decided to literally, and VERY obviously step aside and allowed the 150 lb beast of a defensive linebacker attack the little jerk.  After taking a couple of hits, Nate, the snot nosed coach's son, started hollering at Sam to do his job.  Sam called a time out and very loudly said, ""I tell you what, Nate.  I'll make you a deal - you stop talking smack about me and treating me like dirt, and I will do my job.  Does it seem really smart to be mean to the one person protecting you from a monster sized kid with death in his eyes?  Do you think it makes sense to piss off someone twice your size?  So what do you think?  Are you ready to be nice, or do I need to keep leaving a hole?""  The whole field was silent - and the kid was so red.  His mother gasped.  I was SO SO proud, of Sam - and then someone started clapping, and then everyone joined in.  He handled it like a champ - and since then - there have been no squabbles on that field!",3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,,retold

He is an incredibly good player, good student, and is well-liked.  However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy.  They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.   Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.  He didn't want to turn the kids in because he felt that that would cause more problems, but he did choose to share his concerns with me -as a way to vent.  He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.  He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it.  The coach wound up looking at the security footage from the field for that day, and though he couldn't hear what was being said, he was able to determine who it was, and what was happening.  He showed the whole team the footage at practice the next day.   The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.  They were also suspended from school for their behavior.  I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help but feel a little pleasure in the how this was handled.",3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,recalled

It was really good to see my aunt and uncle again as they are the most similar to myself with our love for technology and in general relaxed personalities. I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide. I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact. We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest. I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family. I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try. I will look at my relationships with my distant family and friends more so we stay more connected. It was great to write about this again because I feel like this is a different view from the last time since I have been chatting with my family more since the last time I did this.,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,,retold

I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see. It was cool to see my grandpa because It's honestly been at least 25 years and since he is handicap it's hard for him to get around. He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up. He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed. My grandma was there too I had my issues in the past with her but it was still nice to see her. She treated my mom poorly so we don't talk much but I put aside my issues just for this small time period to make the gathering go smooth. I got to see my favorite aunt and uncle who both shared similar passions to me with computers and tech stuff and it's been like 20 years since I saw them so that was sweet. Basically they are the same as I remember just older but they are just as into tech stuff as they were back then. I remember I would bring my GameBoy or old PC games over to their house and they would know about them or have them themselves. Just really good memories honesty that I was happy to remember with how stressful life has been. Finally I got to just catch up with some other family members like my cousins and some others who I didn't remember as well cause I was so young back then. This might have been the last time a lot of us get to meet because we all live so far apart and aren't exactly wealthy so we tried to make the most of it. We took a lot of pictures and overall had a great time and we pledged to try and talk over the phone/webcam more often. I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,recalled

Different career path and our family background made us attend different college although it was against our wish. We had planned to attend the same college and even study the same course. Fast forward to four years in college, it was her graduation party. I attended the party with one of our other friends as she was someone we loved so much and very proud of. Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance. I knew it was set to be a glamorous graduation party. I thought she was just going to give a vote of thanks when she picked up the mic. It was more than what I thought as she started talking about her ordeal in college and how she scaled through. She started by thanking God and her parents, the school, faculty and friends. As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey. I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on. I was moved to tears while she talked about me. It was an overwhelming and inspirational experience for me and it made me realize who I am and what I am made of.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO74YHGCE,imagined

I can blame anyone but myself my mom once told me before she left that no one is going to love me like my family is going to love me.

My class mate tells me dont worry about anything but just helping myself. These days i just feel like smashing my head threw a wall becuase i am just being consumed by overwheling revaltions about this world and who i ama. I dont know how people can just move on like that do they not feel as deeply as they show. Have mercy on me have mercy on my soul. I cannot forgive myself at least not yet i am trying and trying.

I was at college that week and it was the final week of classes before finals. I knew that my dog Shelly was sick and that she was in the hospital but I thought I would make it in time. I was so focused on finals and preparing for all the tests that I put Shelly out of my mind to focus on my grades. Mom always was talking about Shelly and how old she was getting but we all were dreading this day. Shelly was my best friend throughout my life. She got me through the school transfer in 6th grade and was my rock. I couldn't believe it when I got the call that she was in the hospital because she stopped eating. I prayed that she would hold on long enough so that I could drive back after finals and see her one last time and tell her how much she meant to me. Shelly was the nicest Boxer a family could ever ask for and I needed to see her off before she passed on. Once finals were over I packed my dorm into my car for winter break and rushed home to the pet hospital. On the way there Mom called, and gave me the news. I had to pull over on the side of the road I was crying so hard. Shelly was the only dog I've ever had but she was the best. She was such a good girl and I wish I could have been there in her final moments. My mom said she passed peacefully but I wish I could've been there to hold her as she passed on. Thank you Shelly.",,3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMXCL4BU,imagined

I was out to dinner with him at a relatively nice restaurant, and I noticed that he would not stop checking his phone. I had noticed that he had done this occasionally in the weeks preceding this event, but it had not been to this extent. I immediately became suspicious. I had been cheated on in past relationships, and I knew the warning signs. I have a hard time executing confrontations, but I decided that enough was enough and I should definitely say something to him. I asked him why he was being so weird lately, and he immediately became defensive. I knew that this was not going to end well, and I did not want to cause a scene in public. So, I said never mind and we ate the rest of our meal in silence. When we left the restaurant and began driving home, he told me that he was going to drop me off at my house. I was fully expecting to come over to his house and sleep over as we usually did, but he obviously did not have the same idea as me. I asked him why and he told me that he wasn't feeling well and just wanted to go lay down. Every part of me wanted to start an argument then and there but I stopped myself, and just remained quiet while he dropped me off. I kissed him and said by like usual, but as soon as he pulled out of my driveway and left, I got in my car and proceeded to follow him. I tried to remain as discrete as possible, and I wound up following him to a house that wasn't his. I was him go inside, and I immediately knew that something was wrong. I got out of my car, knocked on the door, and when a woman answered the door, I immediately turned around got back in my car and went home. I was completely devastated.",3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HQ5KSP7,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HQ5KSP7,recalled

It was a long and gruelly process but sometimes the things that take the longest to transpire are worth the wait. One of the most interesting things that happened during the search was the most memorable ever for me. This was when I met my long time friend from years ago again. His name is Pete. Somehow we lost contact. He and I went to High School together, when we met again he told me about a house that was up for sale after meeting him again in a grocery store. He only lived about two blocks away. Since then we have gotten together a few more times and plan to date again. Now I can truly say I am happy with what I have chosen, and this house will be mine to live in for the rest of my life. Not only that but I have rekindled a good friendship that might turn out to be something more.  This is what intriques me about life in general.",,3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2KI8LLA,imagined

It took a long time finding a home because I am so indecisive and I didn't want to make a mistake and buy something I would hate in the future. This caused me to want to see any and everything that was available. Even after I thought I had seen it as I contemplated which house to purchase I couldn't decide.

This turned out to be the one. It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home. I was in love with the house and put in an offer immediately.

I have a son who just turned 12, and since I'm in my 30's I figured I was done. I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA. So the timing is a little hectic. I always had planned on having another after my son, but when it didn't happen in a few years I started to make other plans. I have been a single mother for years and felt no need to settle, so I was planning on adopting in the next few years. I've also worked very hard on my fitness the past 2 years, and this plan felt perfect so I wouldn't have to give up the progress on my body. About 6 months ago I started dating a coworker, who is a great man. I'd even told him not to expect me to have kids if he wanted to be with me. Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant. At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy. After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though. It's been a huge adjustment, however. I went from living alone to having my boyfriend move in to help with my bills. Being an only child, my personal space is very important to me. I understand some sacrifices are necessary though, and in the end it will definitely be worth it.",3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,recalled

This also let me know that I might not always be in good spot, and that there are people out there who could and want to help me. Besides the important thing of helping people who needed it, the whole garden part about it was really nice as well.

We provide beginner gardens for low income people so they can grow their own vegetables. We give them dirt and plants and seeds to get started. We even provide containers for them if they don't have a yard to plant in. The local gardeners and high school career center students grow tomato and pepper plants and donate them to the event for the people to use to start their gardens. I volunteer at this every year. It's fun to see how excited the children are to be able to pick plants that they want. It makes me feel good because I think what we're doing is showing them another way to feed themselves that's healthy and cheap. The lady that runs it says we're helping the next generation rise out of poverty by giving them the skills to do different things that can better their lives, like growing healthy food. Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids. At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest. The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students. Each year it's a different seed. The students are encouraged to grow the plant at home (this year it was watermelon) and bring it to the Garden Giveaway and enter it in a contest for biggest plant. My favorite part of the giveaway this year was the look on the little boy's face who won for biggest plant! He was so proud. It's moments like that that touch me the most.

It's a program that provides plants, seeds, dirt and containers with dirt for portable gardens for low income people. The lady that runs it was a friend and co-worker of mine, so when I decided to start volunteering I reached out to her and she said this was something she thought I'd like. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there. I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden. When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready. The event was way more than I expected. We had over 100 people show up. They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them. They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow. The best part about it was the kids that came. Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden. It was encouraging to see. Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that. Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults. It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store. I don't really know how all these gardens we gave away turned out. I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today. And I'm hopeful  that down the line we helped raise some future gardeners whose life will be better because of it. The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come. It will be interesting to see if people return and maybe even have stories to tell or pictures of their successful gardens!",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN3ZA2,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN3ZA2,recalled

However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind. This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home. I loved my grandfather so much. I was so close to him. He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot. We always had so much fun together. So I had to go out of state for some work related issues for about two weeks or so. In that time my grandfather was really fit and had no health issues whatsoever. However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now. I had no words to say. I got so panic and did not know what to do. I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours. I had no choice but to wait for the flight. Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day. I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him. Anyway finally, after waiting for couple hours I took the flight and went straight to the hospital. When I reached there I saw that everyone crying and hugging each other. I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa? Is he okay? She said “he is no more, he left us”. When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend. A friend that I used to share everything of my life. That was a big loss of my life. I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.",3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI,recalled

I didn't want that so I tried my best to pass it.  It was an extremely stressful time.  I wasn't afforded much time to prepare for the test, not even a day.  It was sprung on me at a moment's notice.  I was worried that I wasn't going to make it on time to the test.  I managed to make it there.  When I sat down I got right to work.  I started to calm down when I noticed that the questions were things I was very familiar with.  This gave me confidence that I needed at the time.  When the exam was finally done I was relieved.

I used my three attempt and could not figure out how to request a reset. My store does not really have new employees so my boss had no idea how to reset it either. I had to call and basically do my own research before figuring it out. That took a couple days.  Eventually with the pressure on I came in for a saturday to just finish this once and for all.

It was very hot, and the reception being held in a nearby metal barn didn't help either. The bathrooms were in a trailer that was air conditioned, so that was nice. I was able to see family from Chicago, England, LA, and other places I don't normally get to see. It was fun watching my dad have to squirm while he interacted with brothers he doesn't particularly care for. They had an issue with food running out, so my aunt had to call a local pizza place for an emergency order. In the end it all worked out. The ceremony was nice, and my cousin looked beautiful in her dress. I felt like I was sweating too much due to the heat, and the pictures I'm in I don't look too good in.

Her husband's father owns a farm up in the country, and that's where they had the wedding. It was a beautiful view of the fields at the ceremony, but it was way too hot for an outdoor wedding. The reception was inside one of the storage facilities, so that didn't help. They were having issues with the food too, as there wasn't enough of it and they had to order pizza. It was nice going and seeing family members I hadn't seen in a long time. We got a big picture with all the cousins together. Some of my cousins live in England, so it was great to see them and catch up. The most memorable thing about the wedding was the video they played about my cousin and her husband's history. It was well put together and emotional. Once it got dark the heat wasn't so bad, and at least the portable bathrooms they provided were air conditioned. It was only an hour away from where I live too so it was an easy drive back and forth. They offered hotels for any guests who wanted to stay the night, but I'd rather sleep in my own bed. It was definitely a memorable night. I don't get out to the country often.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA84RJUXP,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA84RJUXP,recalled

I was taking a walk in the park with a friend. The weather was gorgeous and the park was quiet, only some children with their parents playing around, and some people walking about and taking advantage of the beautiful day. Then a kind of rumbling noise started. It morphed rapidly into something more akin to a shrieking noise, with an explosive component somewhere in. And it got louder and louder, to the point where it seemed to fill the air around us completely. Of course everyone in the park started looking around to see where the noise came from. And it became quickly obvious that it came from the sky. Six jets, clearly war planes of some kind, flew over us, almost as fast as arrows. They were flying in V formation like geese - dark, deadly, shrieking metal geese. They flew toward the river, and beyond, leaving everybody shaken, overwhelmed and very surprised. Why would they fly like that over a peaceful city like ours? Where were they going? And what were they going to do out there? In that instant, I didn't feel scared for myself or my community, but I felt horrified by the sheer amount of brute force and power displayed. I thought of people living in cities being bombed by similar planes, the horror of it, and the powerlessness of those people. And for the first time, I physically felt what war is, I felt it in my bones, its monstrosity, and what it did to people.",,3WETL7AQWUUAU7G3J6NKKKTO9EE53G,imagined

I wanted to see my sister and surprise her on her birthday. Seeing the rest of the family was also a big plus. Because the family is kind of spread out around the country, we don't get to see each other as often as we would like. We decided to drive down instead of flying so we could make it into more of a road trip. I found that part of it to be very relaxing. Seeing all of the sites along the way was a great experience. When we finally arrived in Miami we immediately set out to get the surprise party worked out. It really paid off. I don't think I've ever seen my sister so surprised or happy when we all yelled Surprise and turned on the lights when she opened the door. There were three different cakes and each one was more delicious than the last. The chocolate cake was my personal favorite. The entire night, you couldn't pry the smile off of my sister's face. She was talking a mile a minute and was just beaming the whole time. Overall, it was a great trip for us and the family as well.",,3WETL7AQWUUAU7G3J6NKKKTOZIN35L,imagined

They were coming from just across the state. So we had a little time to visit with my niece who I'll call N. We also got to meet her staff who works out of N's home. Once my sister (C) arrived we started to have lunch, but not before N took her mother's sandwich and hid it. She made C find it in the oven which was her way of telling her mom and dad that a new grandchild was on the way. Later we found out that N's husband (J) was working his last day for the major department store he worked for. They were restructuring and he was being laid off. But they weren't too concerned about that. We had a great time with everyone that evening. On Sat. we just enjoyed hanging out. N had a dinner party that evening with all of us and J's family.  Sunday was a sit around the pool and finish up the Sat. night leftovers. On Monday it was discovered that the septic system was having an issue. J called someone and we all took off for a little place that sold the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had.  When we returned the problem was fixed. Then is was Tuesday and time for us to head back.  Some other events were playing with some new kittens that N was caring for, watching a lot of TV geared to a 2 year old., visiting an outlet mall and having a SC low country boil dinner for my sister's birthday.

My daughter who has had knee surgery was next to go down and my husband stayed back with her.  We ended up only going to he top of the Alum Cave trail because it was another 5.5 miles to the top and we couldn't not in good conciense make our hiking companions wait on us to complete the entire hike.

As they continue it becomes to strenous for my brother and he has to abandon the hike.  My sister ends up catching up with us as I have really slowed down as it is a straight up hike now.  We are all struggling but are dertemined to make it to the top.  As we round the last bend in the trail and see the top we are overjoyed!  We made it!  At the top is a lodge and we deicde to go in the gift shop and purchase a shirt to proudly display our accomplishment.  As we head down we meet up with my brother first who was not faring well he had run out of water.  We share our water and continue down.

My son in law barbecued chicken, burgers, and hot dogs for everyone.  Most of the family that attended brought side dishes.  Two cakes were presented after lunch.  One said Happy Father's Day and the other was Happy Birthday.  We blew the candles out on each together and laughed.  I had an amazing time watching my grandson open his gifts.  It never fails to amaze me the delight in a young child's eyes.  When evening hit, I knew it was time for me to get home before it got too dark out.  I hugged everyone.

Had a decent amount of time together. we were pretty good friends during that time but it's been years since then. we didn't date or anything but we were close. we had a nice little conversation at the time we met at target. after all was said and done we hugged and talked some more and eventually came to the decision that we would talk to each other again.

It was a fun night overall of catching up and enjoying ourselves.  By the end of the night we find ourselves stopping at Target because a friend needed something out of there.  Everyone else wanted some sort of refreshments so they agreed to stop as well.  So we go in the store and basically split off from one large group.  I find myself heading towards electronics as usual to browse.  A bit after I'm browsing, I realize I need something near sporting goods.  I stop in an isle and I hear a voice call my name.  I froze, caught up in a whirlwind of tons of emotions because I recognized that voice.  It was my ex girlfriend that I'd known for over a decade.  She looked different, like the happiness had been sucked out of her.  She looked tired, really tired and I wondered how she'd been.  She didn't explode with excitement or even move.  Quizzically, she just said my name again.  I greeted her and we embraced.  We hugged for what seemed like 10 minutes and then we finally broke apart and began to catch up.  I tried to keep everything casual but on the inside I felt a bit bad for her and missed her.  She told me about some of the rougher things that were going on and caught me up on what she had been doing.  By the end of it all, I couldn't help but to feel a bit bad but I was happy to have seen her.  We promised to keep in touch and then parted ways again.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,,retold

I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.  There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.  During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up.  Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out.  This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone.  I break off alone and walk through the store to find something in particular and this familiar voice calls my name.  I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.  I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.  Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of.  We walked towards each other, stunned, and embraced one another.  For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything.  Finally, after two minutes or so she whispered in my ear, ""I miss you"".  I walked around with her that night and we talked for a while and caught up.  She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.  By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in.  I ended up calling her again.  It would probably turn out to be a mistake but realistically, even through all of the rough patches, she was the only one that really made sense to me.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,recalled

We normally survive on coffee and something simple to eat. I cooked our favorite which we, I, call egg in a hole. As soon as my girlfriend, or should I say ex-girlfriend by now, entered the kitchen, something felt off. I looked at her face and got a tinge of fear. She looked so serious when she's normally so bubbly. From that moment, all time slowed down but yet everything felt like a blur. First she said she needed to talk to me. I panicked and she must have saw it because she tried to calm me. She said that had found someone else and was no longer in love with me. My heart sank. It came out of nowhere, or I missed all the signs. I begged and pleaded with her not to leave me. I might have made a fool of myself, I cringe when I think of it. I was crushed and began to cry.

There was no fight, there was no argument, she just looks you in the face, tells you she loves you and that you are an ""amazing man"", but she just doesn't feel right and wants to leave. I have never been more confused in all my life, HOW can I be an ""amazing man"" and yet she wants to leave. But there it was, she had been looking at places to move behind my back for months and I guess seeing someone else as well. I bought my first house with this woman, adoped a dog with this woman and swore to take care of this woman (to her father) and now she wants to leave. We bought the house, that house flooded two months later, I busted my butt to rebuild and make it more comfortable for HER, not me HER. And now she's leaving. My purpose for having a house and rebuilding it the way I did was there no longer. One of the hardest things in my life. So what to do? Well, I pack. She didn't want to be there, she was coming to get her stuff (eventually), so I began to pack every-single-thing of hers and shove it away. So I didn't have to see it. Pots, pans, utensils, everything that could be taken down or moved was packed. Anything that reminded me of her. I repainted rooms, redecorated, tried to make what I built for her mine in a few weeks time. I spent time outside and built a patio, I built furniture that would replace the ones that I bought for her. When her dad and uncle came to help her pack they had tears in their eyes, I guess they loved me too (or knew how much pain I was in). They didn't know why I did most of the hard work for them, it was because they were great men and I wanted them to be my family, hell, sometimes I still do... but it just wasn't meant to be. I helped load her up and send her on her way to a new life, and I was left trying to rebuild mine... again.",3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX4H5U05,,retold

She said it just didn't fell right, after 3 years! We bought a house together (luckily I put that in my name only), adopted a dog together and I was starting to plan out our future. Then that rug was pulled out from underneath me, like Thanos snapping his damn finger. Did I see it coming? Not at all, I thought she was the one. Should I have seen it coming, yup! She would often travel to see her family which lived over an hour away, sometimes I'd go, sometimes not. I found out she was talking to an ex of hers, but sometimes people make mistakes. We found about it, and got on with life. Her friends (who are still my friends which is odd) told me that they warned me, well I guess I was so in love it would have taken a Mack truck to hit me with it. So here I am, heartbroken and just me and the dog (and yes, I told her I was keeping him and there wasn't going to be a discussion about it) so what do I do. I begin to pack all her crap up, YUP, EVERY LAST BIT. Why? Because I loved her, and I loved her family, and why punish her family by making them do it. So there I am, boxing and storing lady's under garments and unmentionables. All plates, pans, cooking utensils, eating utensils, sheets, towels, hell even lightbulbs. She made me keep the furniture because it was too much, she said, but everything else that reminded me of her is gone. I know what a divorce feels like, well except the whole court/lawyer fee thing. Fast forward to now, I'm still without most of the crap she took with her. I bought a stainless steel pot set because I liked the look, but I can't cook on it for crap, so I don't use it much. One set of sheets, 1 towel, paper plates and plastic forks. I kinda wish I wasn't such a smartass and kept some of it, but I wanted her to know I could do it without her. Can I though?
