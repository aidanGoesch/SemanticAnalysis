I learned my lesson about trusting them with such a job. my bookcase is still busted i havent replaced it becuse i dont have the money. the whole ordeal was very messy.,,,0.0

We had a difficult time choosing a country in Europe. We deliberated for months before this, before we finally decided that we should make the vacation more exciting. To this this, we decided to rule out Europe and choose a South American country or an Asian country. At the end, we decided to chose Japan. This is a complete surprise because I never had any intention of going to a country outside of Europe. After making our choice, we did some research, prepared and traveled to Japan. Arriving Japan felt like arriving at a different world or an alternate world. Everything just felt different and strange. I have been to two other countries outside the US, but they were countries that had quiet a similar culture to US so it was easy. Japan was a lovely country, the country felt so organised, maybe a bit too organised. I am someone who loves structure but I was overwhelmed by how structured everything was.  The Japanese people were very polite and friendly, we had bonus points for trying to learn how to speak their language. The Japanese people were neat almost to a fault. All the streets and public places were so clean that it felt like they all had germophobia. They were also incredibly disciplined, they always kept to their words. After three interesting weeks in Japan, my husband and I decided to come back to the US. We felt good coming back, but we couldn't stop ourselves from making a lot of comparisons.",,,0.0

I bought my condo last year and the courtyard was one thing I had always wanted and had based my purchase on it. I've taken horticulture in college so I'm pretty knowledgeable about how to do it. About 4 years before I purchased the condo, previous owners had hired a landscape company to decorate it with a flowering tree, plants, pond and black river rock stone as mulch. They sold the condo to a retired woman a year later and she never even pulled one weed. So when I bought it, it was an overgrown jungle. My first step was pulling out weeds and dead bushes. My next step, which took about 3 months, was pulling out all the river rock from about 1 foot down in the dirt. From rain and other weather, the rocks had sunken down through the landscape fabric and underneath all the weeds. Every day, I spent 15-30 minutes overturning the dirt, one shovel scoop at a time, then pulling each rock out (from 1 in. to 4 inches wide) and tossing them into huge plastic bins in the garage. I then drew out a new landscape plan, bought the plants, dug the holes and planted them. To my surprise, I called a pond company and I was able to afford their services of rebuilding my broken down pond and adding a filter, pump and some underwater plants. After that was all done, I called a landscape company to drag the bins out of the garage, lay down new landscape fabric and all those black rocks. I also brought out my garden decor, added fish to the pond, added some smaller plants to decorative pots and finally stood back to look at my work. I can't believe how beautiful it is and my neighbors also love it. It's a soothing place to come out to several times a day for relaxation.",,,0.0

My job had to cut back my hours, so income has been tight and I have been running a little behind on bills. I have good credit and have never needed to take out a loan before. I figured now may be a good time to try, so I can pay down my outstanding debt before it gets out of hand. I was very nervous to apply. It took me a few days to get up the strength to do so. But then... my application was denied. At first, I felt guilty. Worthless. Like a failure. After a while, I started to feel frustrated and helpless. I don't even know why I was denied since my credit history is great and credit score is 750. I've never defaulted on a loan---in fact, I have never even taken one out before. So my only guess is my lower income resulted in the denial. How is someone supposed to get ahead in this world?",,,0.0

About 3 months ago, he had to stay in the hospital for 48 hours to be continually monitored. This had to be done due to concerns from his teachers. They were saying he seemed to be drifting off at random times and not responding. Because of them reporting this issue, we made an appointment with his neurologist. She stated that the only way to see if he was still having seizure activity was to monitor him for 2 days in the PICU. So we set a date and time and waited patiently for it to come around. The day of the test, we arrived very early. They showed us to his room and within an hour the tech was there to begin the process. As they attached the multiple amounts of electrodes to my young child's head, I began to get very emotional and I'm not sure why. It's hard to see your child has an issue. You feel like you may have done something wrong at some point to cause it. All of my family came to visit my son while he was in the hospital and it was very heartwarming that everyone came together to be there for him. The best part about the whole situation was that the test showed no new seizure activity. This means that hopefully he will grow out of his condition over the next few years and can completely wean off of seizure medication and enjoy a normal teenage and adult life.",,,0.0

The Dr. told her that she was dilated to a 5 and that she should probably stay there in the hospital, but she was far to stubborn for that, after that this was our 4th kid. After we left the hospital she said that if she was gonna have a baby today that wasn't going to do it on an empty stomach. So we went in town to get some food. She ate everything on the menu it seemed. I think she got 4-5 different dishes, it was funny. After eating we went ahead and drove the 45 mins home. We sat around and watch TV and did some other things the rest of the day, then we put the other kids to bed and went to bed ourselves. Ate 3am she wakes me up and say Shes having hard contractions. I wake up and ask her how hard to realize that she cant even move and that they are back to back... awesome. I call her mom and tell her to come over and sit at our house while our kids slept so we could go to the hospital. I get dressed and try to get her outside to my truck, she cant get off the ground to get in while having contractions so i literally picked her up and threw her in. Her mom still wasn't there, I called her and for the first time in my life told her to do something ""you need to get here, we gotta go"" I said. We went ahead and left our kids at home since she was only a minute away and I drove as fast as my truck has ever driven. There I was driving 100+ in an 8200lb truck down the interstate nervous as she kept having contractions in my truck turned around bent over holding the back of the seat. it was nuts.

We both had obligations to fill, and our schedules were packed to the gills with various work. This led to us both feeling rather stressed. So when we did have some time, we went all out. My wife had never seen Disney world before. Originally hailing from China, she would hear stories about this magical place. She never would have thought she'd have the chance to visit. So we took the first jet from NYC to Orlando and went to the magic kingdom. All of the parks - Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Animal Kingdom. She enjoyed every minute of the rides and the masterful design of the parks. I would say her favorite park was animal kingdom, particularly for the amount of birds we saw. We spent about a week in Orlando, visiting other sites, such as Universal Studios. However, the main attraction for her was Disney. We came home and resolved to spend more time together, and now we try to do something fun and unique at least once a month. As a result, we feel much happier and fulfilled.",,,0.0

She called to tell me that they wouldn't give her the day off. I was really sad but I understood. At the last minute she called and said that someone worked a double shift so she would be able to come over for my birthday. They have been short staffed and the girl doing the schedule didn't ask my daughter if it was okay to put her on for the day she asked off. So her boyfriend worked and took another shift from someone that would come in and work for my daughter. I was really happy to find out she would be able to come because I only get to see her every couple of months. She came over and spent the whole day with me. She brought me breakfast and a new charm for my bracelet. We spent a relaxing day just hanging out. We went to Hobby Lobby and looked around but I couldn't find anything I liked. So we came home and had dinner. After dinner we had cake and it started to get dark. She headed home and text me when she made it.,,,0.0

My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be. It was a rough couple of weeks but I'm glad we could get justice for Eric.",,,0.0

It is a time I look back on fondly, and many good memories were formed during that time. I went to the beach and I walked around, relaxed, and enjoyed the sites. The weather was not too hot and not too cold, there was also a nice breeze and the water was just right. I think the fact that I had enjoyed myself so much on that day signaled a sign of a good summer. There were a lot of fun things that happened on the beach. I played with my dog. We both went swimming and I laughed at the way he swam. I had also remembered to bring my fishing pole, as there is a dock there. I was not lucky enough to catch anything. However, I still appreciated the meditative atmosphere of the act of fishing in itself. Even though I was not able to catch anything, I still had plenty of various snacks and meals for my dog and I. The sunset at the beach was very beautiful. I enjoyed the wide array of colors, and the sounds of the birds as they wound down for the night. I left after dusk, and I did not encounter anyone there the whole day. I slept beautifully that night as I was plenty tired after a full days outing that I had just taken. I still think back on the day often and I plan to make it a yearly trip to enjoy and signal the beginning of summer.",,,0.0

We prepared for the graduation for almost a month. The graduation day served as a reunion for a lot of people. Since he grew up in Washington, a lot of friends were able to attend the ceremony. This was to my delight. I was also surprised at how far he has come in life. I know that I have been with him all the way, but this was still surprising ( similar to how surprising it is for parents as they watch their children grow). The day of the ceremony was pure delight. I was introduced to some of his college friends which was a bit shocking to me as he has always had a private and compartmentalized life. I also talked to his girlfriend, whom I had never met. It is necessary to understand why I was so happy. My son was depressed in high school, and had attempted to commit suicide. Seeing him graduate college was overwhelming and crazy for me.

I knew vague details of our family history, such as Great grandpa LeBrun marrying a native american woman from the Kalapuya tribe in Oregon and settling down on the Willamette river area, but there were a lot of details that were either never shared with me or forgotten. My younger sister got  a subscription to an ancestry website and the three of us started digging and telling stories. I learned that my Great great grandfather was part of a group that voted for the area that is now Washington State to become part of Canada. I also learned that my great grandfather was a tax collector that raised horses. Among all of these stories I learned that my great grandmother lost nine of her eleven children to diphtheria. The only reason my grandmother and her twin survived is because they were kept in the snow outside and warm bricks were wrapped up and changed 24 hrs a day.  My grandfather, her father, inherited a huge sum of money from his tax collecting father. At one time he owned 500 acres of Willamette Valley bottom land, (which now grows incredible wine grapes) He was the first in his family to graduate HS but couldnʻt get a job because he was half native american so he started drinking heavily. This led him to be missing or in jail for large portions of time, leaving my mom and her mother vulnerable to threats from the local KKK. She told me about being followed home as a child, how they would threaten to burn her house down. She was so sad when she told me about how they couldnʻt even afford a proper lock on the front door.

For me however, there was nothing strange about it, it's very run of the mill.   For me, the strange part, is that I actually am taking the time to write it down.  The dream started with me laying on my childhood bed.  My mother in the next room started complaining about the noises outside her window and how she was trying to sleep.  I peaked out of my window and looked  towards the neighbors ' house, not much noise coming from there.  I decided to go outside and see what else was going on.  Ahh, this must be what she's barking about, a father showing his son how to use the recycling bins.   ""It's nothing Mom!""  I yelled as I headed back to the bed room.  In that instant I remember being semi conscious it was a dream and a voice, either my own, or maybe even the father outside made a comment somehow unknowingly on the situation: ""See when you work for 30 years, you earn the money to build a life for you so that you can enjoy your life after."" Unlike my mother's situation where she lay in bed jobless, complaining.  I went in the living room and noticed drawers full of pink starburst, ""Just like in real life.""  I thought, knowing I bought a bag about a week ago, having a brief second of knowing that this was all a dream.   Shortly however I was back to being unaware.  I thought about our neighborhood and what it would look like with a lake.   ""We could shoot all kind of game!"" Explained a man who was suddenly in my living room.  I asked ""Do you think they would stock it with bass?""  Figuring a hunter would know such things.  ""Of course!"" He replied.  I then realized that this was all a daydream.   To which point I thought if I told my mother she would try it and relax for a bit.  It kept going but I think this is a good summary for now!",,,0.0

I live in Lake Havasu City, desert, but with a lake.  My husband and I really aren't into the whole lake scene as far as it's a ""party town"",  but being able to take walks by it and such are very enjoyable.  Recently my kids came to visit for 3 days and we rented a boat for one day, but what was more enjoyable was the third day we drove to the Grand Canyon.  I had only seen it as a small child, 6 years old.  My husband had grown up not far from there.  My kids had never seen it.  Since I hadn't seen my kids in years, even the time driving there was enjoyable because we could ""catch up"" as well as the fact that they had never met my husband.  Once we got there we picked the tour that we felt my husband could best handle since he is visually impaired.  My kids were very patient  at not getting too far ahead of us and such.  We had a fantastic day.  We will never forget seeing a cliff with a small plateau and this mountain goat was just standing on the plateau.  Pretty amazing how it got there.  On way back we talked about times in our life when we had ""mountains in life"" to climb and how we got to the top.  Overall, just an experience that I hope to have again.",,,0.0

He has been an integral part of my life and my daily routine. Then one day in June 2019, i got a call from him at an unusual hour. He was not sounding his usual ebullient self. I tried to press him to know what was bothering him but he kept insisting he was fine. I sent my sister who lived in same neighborhood to go check him up. She also phoned to say he was doing fine. She went back to her own place. But i had an uneasy feeling. The following morning, i kept calling dad but his phone rang away with no response. I took my car and drove all the way to his place. I have a spare key to the house. I got in and went straight into his room where he laid peacefully on the bed, cold, not moving. He was gone! I was terribly devastated. Not even a goodbye to me!.

We stayed at a great hotel they gave us free breakfast which we really enjoyed . We went to a couple of museums. We got to learn a little bit of interesting things about history that neither of us new about. we went swimming almost every day and night.

It was something that really opened my eyes to what my health and in turn my life could be like. This story is about a revelation of sorts that Living healthy and happy is something that I can achieve. One of the key moments in this story was when I met my all time fitness idol, ""the mountain"". It was a glorious day as I started getting in to strength training and fitness a couple of years ago when I went through a deep depression. This was a very significant event for me because fitness and strength training specifically changed my life. When I met my idol I was awestruck at how big he was but like me, he started somewhere. He told me consistency is key and even when you desperately want to give up, you have to push even harder and faster to break through it. His advice was so invaluable to me at the time because I had felt like giving up many times. I had him autograph a picture I had of him winning a strongman competition. This was such a great experience as It really motivated me to get better and stronger, which I did. I worked harder than ever after meeting him and realizing anyone can be strong with the work put in. I have realized that with almost everything in life, consistency is the most important thing which is what the experience taught me. I now try to be consistent in everything I do and it has paid off big time in the long run. I have been successful in all areas of my life so far by doing this.",,,0.0

Last year, I decided to take my chances with dating websites, and see who was out there for women my age. I am a little unusual, in that I am a professional musician, and keep strange hours. I am also looking for someone who is not your run-of-the-mill person. After going on many dates with different people, and meeting mostly alcoholic ne'er-do-wells, I met a very interesting man who was a blues musician. We instantly were attracted to each other, and embarked on a 4.5-month-long, very passionate relationship. It just ended two and a half weeks ago, because he went back to his old girlfriend. I discovered that was his plan pretty much all along. I believed dating at my age would be easy, because I thought people would know what they want in life. What I found was that people have an inordinate amount of baggage, much more than they do in their 20s and 30s. Maybe I'll meet someone else; I sure hope so. Falling in love over 60 is rough.

The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",,,0.0

I took on a side job that lasted for over 3 nights. My side job included me planning and managing an exciting extra event  of the planned show. The event was organized to happen in different locations of the show area. In the locations there were settings made to surprise selected fans attending the show by deceiving them. One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.",,,0.0

We planned with the cruise to have a special cake made for her. We also had a singer sings to her Happy Birthday at our table, which was quite the comedic event. We drank frou-frou drinks daily, and ate too much food. We went to nightly entertainment, and an art auction. A few nights we sang karaoke in the bar, and made a fool out of ourselves. We cannot sing but we sure did try. We went to the casino everyday, and a few of us won a couple hundred dollars. We went dancing often, and met some great people.

As it is usually just my son and I home we have things down to a 't' when it comes to our schedule but his grandma was home which messed things up a bit. Not only for him but for me too. She's a lot harder to entertain versus a 10 month old. But I had let her take him in with her and she was making her bed. This bed is a good 4 feet off the ground mind you. She decided to put him on top of it and when she was on the other side my poor baby had fallen off. So of course I rush in with my heart beating out of my chest because he was crying so bad. She was trying to explain but I didn't want to hear none of it, I just wanted my baby to be okay. I eventually got him calm and he went to sleep but when he woke and started back in on crying again I knew something wasn't right. I was so angry at her for hurting him though she didn't intentionally hurt him. I still blamed her because I thought how could you not be more careful? You know your bed is a mountain compared to this baby, you know he moves fast! How, how, how did you not think that this would have happened before it did. So we took him to the doctors and this poor little 10 month old is already in to get x-rays. I was devastated, embarrassed and so, so sorry for my little guy. Turns out he got a small fracture to the wrist. So they put a cast on him for 3 weeks and they said the bone will be stronger than it was before since he is so young. It was reassuring but it sure didn't make me feel any better about the situation. Yeah, last week sucked.",,,0.0

Earlier this month I was finally able to get an assignment from a temp agency. Getting the job itself took planning and luck. I don't have a car so I had to take four buses and commute five hours to make it to the temp agency. Once there I had to submit my application all over again even though I filled one out online at home. The ""interview"" was rather unprofessional but I needed a job so I wasn't going to complain. I took my drug test and received my orientation date, then left. I made it back to the bus stop in good time so I didn't have to wait another hour. The rest of my commute went smoothly. While I waited on the bus that would begin my trip home, I received a phone call from the temp agency. In my haste, I missed a signature on my drug test paperwork. Without the signature my drug test would be invalid and I couldn't attend orientation. I was asked to come back and finish the paperwork, but I didn't want to risk missing buses back home. Since the orientation was scheduled for a few days later, I asked if I could just retake a drug test before the orientation. The agency would have the documentation they needed and I would have time to get everything done. Thankfully the temp agency obliged and I was able to get everything done and start orientation on time.",,,0.0

It was entirely a volunteer effort. Because I was unemployed at the time, I was able to go there to help almost every day. The larger group would sometimes come in the evenings to help, but usually they wouldn’t come until Sunday. With our small group, we managed to cover large sections of the parking area. After a few months, we managed to fill the entire parking area with the exception of the back side of the church building. Each week, people were surprised at the progress we made. We had managed to do quality work despite the shortage of people. After finishing the parking, we noticed a problem in certain sections of the parking lot. We had to then remove some bricks so that they would be place accurately. This took longer than expected because it involved removing a wide area of bricks. We had to carefully put bricks back in the proper place so that the pattern would be consistent. Eventually we finished and had a nice sense of accomplishment. The last thing to do was clean up the debris and trash. Then we were done.",,,0.0

I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I had my family back together. The feelings I felt that whole day up until seeing him is just something I could never forget. He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish.",,,0.0

I guess because had dealt with it and made peace with the outcome that was going to happen no matter what. We also talked about what I could do after he passed to become a man. He wanted what was best for me, He wanted to see my grow and do better as a person overall. I appreciated everything he did for me. I also appreciated him trying to make the most out of a bad situation. I feel most people wouldn't be able to do that, but my uncle was a strong minded person. You rarely, if ever would see him feeling down about himself or week about something. He knew that life was never always going to be great and peaches and roses. But he would make the best of each and every scenario possible. That's one thing I will miss about him and forever remember, just how strong of a person he was inside. He was like a second father to me with how he treated me and did stuff for me and with me. I could never forget any of the conversations we had that night. I swear we talked for at least 3 hours just about life, the future, the past. Literally just everything you could think of, we discussed.",,,0.0

My team lost I was crying and it made me very emotional because I felt like I let everyone down. After the game we had the award ceremony the worst part I think was standing up trying to smile while receiving runner up trophies. It was the best season that we had and it all came down to one play and I couldn't get it done. It was a lot of emotions going around because my family had came to watch the game and I wanted to put on a show. This event is very significant to me because it showed me how to lose. Winning is probably one of the best feelings in the world but you learn more from a loss. That's why I chose to talk about this story and not any other. This writing task was challenging, and fun in any ways. It made me think while also reminiscing it was a very interesting task. It brought up feelings of regret, anguish, and lastly relief. Mainly because I know that moment is over and it helped shape who I am today I don't have to take it as a failure. This task overall was very fun and interactive as a whole.

She was so blunt and candid that I got attracted to her immediately. Her courage to speak up was impeccable  She cautioned my abuser at length. She made it clear that he was the type that brings a bad name to the USA. Made him realize how wrong he was.

I was the first person he thought of to invite to the concert, which I thought was very nice and sweet of him. The show was amazing, and it a great bonding experience for me and my friend. I felt much closer to him afterwards. It was a very positive emotional experience for me, because I got to experience it with a close friend and because I'm very passionate about music.

Being his best man was a great honor and I am very grateful that he chose me to be so. My brother has a number of really close friends who could have easily performed the duties of first man, but he chose me. The wedding was beautiful. Family and friends came from all over to be there. Amber, the bride, looked stunning and her bridesmaid's also. We rented a farmhouse next to a lake as the venue. The weather was perfect, which is a rare occurrence in the deep south. Not too hot and not too cold.  The only potential problem was me. I have a terrible fear of public speaking and the best man is required to do a lot of that. But it was my little brother's wedding. I had a duty and the great honor of being the best man. I could not fail him or let my anxiety rule the day. In this case, being the best man also afforded me the opportunity to be there for my family and little brother and to work on myself as a human being, conquering my anxiety about public speaking and rising to the occasion. I learned that most anxiety is anticipatory, and that once the speech has begun, things are easier. So the speech and toast went off without a hitch. Dylan, my brother was happy, and, most importantly, Amber, the bride, had a happy day.",,,0.0

Not only was it a vacation, and not only was it a way for the whole family to get together and see each other (which rarely happens these days), it was also the last time we all figured we would be able to take a trip together with my grandfather, who had become quite frail over the past couple years. His condition was not improving, so we thought the trip would be a great way for all of us to bond with him at least one last time. The actual trip itself was fantastic. I had never been on a cruise before, and although I was slightly nervous given the way the media portrays cruises (i.e. Titanic), once I got on board I had forgotten all about that. The boat was huge and beautiful and there were friendly faces where ever you went. There were musical performances every night, and so many activities every day to do, from quiz shows based on disney properties, to learning how to fold towels into animals. There was even a theater on the ship, where I saw Coco for the first time (which I definitely teared up over). But the best thing was the food. There were a lot of restaurants, each with their own theme. Between buffets in the morning and five star meals in the evening, I was never hungry. My grandfather was with us for most of the activities, but there was one instance that gave us quite a scare. As I was moving around the ship with my sister, I received a message from my uncle telling me to come to his cabin immediately. Apparently my grandfather was really not doing well. When we got to the cabin the rest of the family was surrounding him as he laid still on the bed. There was a look of concern on everyone's face. My mom was trying to get him to eat a banana earlier, but he had stopped eating. As we were all looking at him worriedly, he suddenly jumped up and bit the banana that was in my mom's hand. We were all startled, but when his mouth curled into a smile, we all started laughing. It was the most memorable part of the trip for sure.",,,0.0

I tripped on that broken basement step that I keep forgetting to fix.   I was carrying a jar of  pickles at the time, and when I fell, the jar broke and badly cut my hand and wrist.  I couldn't get the bleeding to stop, so I called an ambulance.  It was embarrassing to have to call them, but I was losing a lot of blood.  They put a tourniquet on it and took me to the emergency room which was less than 5 minutes.  The damage was pretty bad and the cuts were jagged so they had a lot of trouble getting it sewn together.  They used a lot of glue on top of the stitches as well.  It didn't hurt very much, but I wouldn't realize until the next day that that was a bad sign.  They wrapped the whole thing in a large bandage and I went home.  It wasn't for another hour or more before I realized I couldn't feel anything in my last two fingers.  I thought maybe the bandage was wrapped too tight and ignored it, but the next day I took some of the wrapping off and realized that I didn't have feeling in the fingers or that part of  my palm below them either.  I also couldn't spread my fingers or move them much.  I was still hoping a lot of this would heal, but I looked online and saw that I might have some permanent damage.  It was  depressing news, and I was pretty upset about possibly not being able to use the hand again, but since I don't have insurance, there wasn't much I could do except to hope that when the swelling came down some, it would improve.  Unfortunately, I found over the next week that the hand would never come back to the way it was before.  Fortunately it was my left hand and I was able to compensate for it pretty well, but there are some things I can't do and if people look at it closely, they could see that the two smaller fingers are permanently bent in a weird way.  I did fix that basement step, though.",,,0.0

I think that I would like to talk about graduation day.  I have four daughters that I adopted from China. They are beautiful girls turning into beautiful and very special women.  As the school year for 2018-2019 was winding down, I was getting ready for my second daughter to graduate. This was an exciting time. She was very excited and could not wait to walk onto that stage. I was so proud of her. I couldn't contain myself. She exuded confidence and held her head up high.  She was always quite the go-getter. She signed up for many clubs and ran some of the clubs as well. She was always willing to help someone out and was liked by her teachers. I was proud of the way she carried herself. When she applied for college, she was accepted at every one she applied for. Of course she took the one that was at the top of her list. I write about graduation because right now I am getting ready to take her to college. She has had a jam-packed summer. She started her first real job and just completed it this week. She will always have that retail experience under her belt and will always be able to find a job in this field. If that wasn't enough, she took on a second part-time job as well. She also purchased most of the items for her dorm herself. Okay and if that's not enough, she has also accepted her first job at college. I digress. Watching her walk down the aisle at graduation was amazing.",,,0.0

In most cultures, birthdays are celebrated in some of the same ways. Often, birthdays are celebrated with a gift, party, or some other special act. main event this Falling in love with the person that is your perfect fit is one of the best feelings in the world. Although it's not uncommon to find yourself falling in love (or simply, lust) with the wrong person before getting to Mr. Right, when you finally meet the guy for you, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Everything you thought you knew about love and relationships will suddenly be turned on its head. And it's not just love you'll feel - you'll go through a whole host of other positive emotions. Here are some of the things you can expect to feel when you start falling for the right someone. When I met my husband, the primary emotion I remember feeling was shock. It sounds nuts, but I truly couldn't believe he even existed. I had spent so much time before not even sure if I wanted to be in a relationship. I didn't really believe that true love was real, and I definitely didn't think I'd ever feel so strongly about someone that I wanted to be with forever. Falling in love with the right person will leave you feeling surprised, like you didn't see it coming. You'll marvel at the fact that someone so perfect for you even exists - let alone loves as much as they do, too. In prior relationships, I would purposely not express how I was feeling most of the time, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. It could be the biggest thing, like disappointment over a friend moving, to the smallest, like moodiness from PMS. It didn't matter - if it was a real feeling, I kept it to myself. With my husband, however, I want to do the exact opposite: share everything with him. When you're with the right someone, you'll know because you'll feel safer than you ever have in the past. In relationships before my husband, I knew what it was like to feel momentarily excited (or even happy) for a little bit.",,,0.0

We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her. I approached it like how my counselor told me to, and she said I have to realize that it may not go the way it is intended to, and she was right, and that is why it hurt all the more.",,,0.0

This is the highest paved road in North America and sits just outside of Denver, Colorado. We took this excursion while we were on our first vacation without kids since our honeymoon; we have been married for just over 13 years. The event was emotional because the views on the way up the mountain were striking. You could see a number of other peaks across Colorado as you made the ascent and the landscape was beautiful. There were snow-covered mountain sides and a lake on the way up the mountain where you could get out and explore. We walked a number of trails. At times, the trails made me nervous as they were on the sides of high elevations and there weren't a lot of supports around. I was stressed at times that I was at risk of falling. The most memorable part of the trip was when we came across a herd of mountain goats near the top of the mountain. They would come right up to the side of the car and had no apprehension about the presence of humans. They were fun to observe, particularly the young goats in the herd, as they would frolic and play on the hillside. Though the event was memorable, it was also something that could be frustrating at times. It was crowded on the mountain that day. This wasn't unexpected, as the road is only safe to travel for roughly two to three months out of the year. But many people were driving in an unsafe manner. Some sped down the mountain. Others were not paying attention because they were distracted by the scenery. That added to the stress of the drive, which was somewhat nerve-wracking to begin with because the road was very narrow and didn't always feel safe. Arriving at the mountain top made it worth it though, as the view was breath taking. That said, it was hard to breath due to the high elevation at the summit, as the mountain is more than 14,000 feet up. I would do it again if given the chance. I even told my wife that it would be nice to take the kids to see the mountain and make the drive someday. It is an experience that I hope I never forget.",,,0.0

I woke up that morning to check my facebook and was able to see all the wonderful people that told me Happy Birthday this year.  Oh and by the way, my husband forgot my birthday!  After all I am 35 and as you get older the less people celebrate you on your birthday and the more you hate celebrating because it means you are getting older.  So, back to the rest of the day, I sat there alone all day and then got a call from my best friend Callie Jane.  She told me she was thinking about me but had also forgot the exact day of my birthday.  I understood as I have trouble remembering as well these days too.  I told her it was actually today and that we would be celebrating my birthday at Oscar's it is a local bar and grill.  She told me that she would definitely make it.  Well two hours later I get a call from my husband as he is getting off work at this time.  It was around 3 that afternoon.  He tells me that he is sorry that he forgot my birthday and that he had talked to my best friend Callie Jane as well.  He told me that she wanted to throw a party for me at her place and asked what kind of cake I wanted.  I said that was okay, and that I wanted a cheesecake because I do not like regular cake.  So the plans were set, I was going to her house for my birthday.  She called me later that evening and told me that we would have a fish fry and cake.  I think I was 21 the last time it happened.  I also love fish and knew she was getting me a cheesecake.  So anyways, fast forward to the day of my party.  We get there and she has balloons and it is all decorated just for me.  Her and her friend Cara, that I recently met, put the whole party together.  But wait, that is not it, they also had me a gift.  It was a munchie basket.  I also got a homemade necklace from Cara which I love.  So, the night was wonderful we had drinks and mingled with a bunch of people.",,,0.0

I used to stay in a basement area and it was really dirty and gross, and had lots of mold. The man upstairs who rented it to me was an alcoholic and he would play his music at stadium level volume and it was very awful to endure.  After almost a year of that, including being harassed non stop for not speaking Spanish, I was able to find another place in a different city away from the man and his awful habits. It only took a day to move out, since I do not have much stuff. I was able to move in with a friend, and my boyfriend and things are much better here. I have personal privacy now, whereas I did not before. I didn't even have a bedroom before in the basement. I had to sleep on the concrete floor with spiders and centipedes around. I hated it and I am glad I was able to move. I am not as depressed and anxious as I was before. I was always getting harassed by Hispanic people for being American and not speaking Spanish.

Even though he is our second child, I felt many of the same emotions as when our older son was born almost five years ago. However, the circumstances were different enough that even though the experience overall was just as life-changing as I expected, it was more even in terms of emotional volatility. With our first son, we learned late in the process that he would have to be delivered early -- basically up to six weeks early, due to a spike in my wife's blood pressure. This made for a great deal of uncertainty. This time, we anticipated the baby to be induced early, and as such we were calmer throughout the process. Even so, the birthing process is a primal one, even for me, a spouse whose job is to provide support rather than actual physical labor. We went to the hospital at around 7 in the evening, expecting the process to take 24 hours or more as it had with our first child. Ultimately, however, our new baby was born healthy only about 12 hours later. There were some frustrating times during the labor. We did not have a proper ""labor bed"" because we had to switch rooms due to some non-functioning equipment in the initial room. The nurses did not notice this until my wife was about to deliver and it was too late to get a different bed. This made me slightly anxious, but I was calmed by the reassuring demeanor of the medical team. Prior to that, we managed to feel something -- anger -- that we had not expected. The doctors and nurses were very busy because of a full load of patients and multiple births happening at the same time. Because of that, the doctor who was supposed to come to our room to discuss pain relief options, including an epidural, arrived too late to have a meaningful impact on my wife's comfort level. In fact, his callous demeanor made us quite frustrated and upset. Ultimately, though, that faded into the background when our healthy baby boy was born.",,,0.0

On the day of counselling, he accompanied me the office of the Director of Medical Education. On seeing my name in the list of the selected candidates for GMC, he was elated beyond measures. It could be seen in his face; it was being reflected in his eyes and his voice. We went home after the counselling was over. As the entire family sat for lunch, he suddenly called me to his room. I went inside grandpa gave me a box, somewhat twice the size of a typical geometry box, and it looked very old. I opened the box - it contained the equipments I'd be needing for MBBS in the 1st year. I smiled as he gave the box to me. He then said the following words which I'll never be able to forget. He said - “Annu, I had brought this set almost 20 years back. As I was passing by one of the medical supplies shop during my trips (he's a surveyor), my eyes fell upon this box. It was expensive at that time, and more than that- unnecessary, yet, I still bought it, hoping that someday I can give it to my children or grandchildren. You've fulfilled my dream today. Maybe, God wanted me to witness this. Maybe, He has kept me alive for this day only.” That day, I'll make you proud in the truest sense.",,,0.0

It was not my fault at all, some imbecile ran a stop sign and t-boned me. However, the idiot told the cops I ran a red light, and since there were no witnesses, it was a mess. However, luckily for me, I had  a dashcam installed only a few weeks prior. I was able to go to my insurance company and tell them I had footage. They took this footage to the other insurer and I was offered damages for my car. I refused and said I wanted damages and diminished value for my car, since if I try to sell it, it will come up as a car that was in a wreck. Initially they refused, but since I had a tape of what had happened, I was eventually able to get damages plus diminished values. It took way longer than it should have and I was in a rental car for over 2 weeks.  However, on the plus side, the rental car was a really cool Jeep that I would have never driven before. It was brand new, with only a couple hundred miles on it. It was like having an extended test drive. And that test drive happened to be free eventually. I hated having to do this because insurance companies move so slowly. I had to initially pay for the rental without knowing if I would get reimbursed.",,,0.0

I headed to class at my usual time of 10:00 a.m.  I decided to stop by the convenience store and grab a coffee and a snack on the way. That was a huge mistake. I was standing in line waiting to pay for my items when I hear someone scream loudly! I look towards the sound and see a man holding a woman at gunpoint. Another man emerges with a gun and tells the cashier to empty the cash register into a bag. The cashier complied and the men ran from the store. The cashier had tripped  the silent alarm, so the robbers were caught before they could get into their car. When all the police started streaming into the parking lot, with guns drawn, it was the most surreal feeling. Almost like watching a television show. Thankfully, nobody was hurt and the bad guys were arrested. The whole ordeal was over in less than 10-minutes. It was probably the most frightening 10-minutes I have ever experienced. I found out today that the robbers were teenagers. They will be tried as adults. I don't want to be afraid of going into a store for the rest of my life, but being in an armed robbery is very negative emotionally. This event did remind me to enjoy each day because we never know when it might be our last.",,,0.0

I've been out of the game for about 3 months now, and while I would never consider going back to it, I do like to reflect every now and then. It all started with a girl I had met in college. A woman, really. She was about 5 years older than me at the time, I 19, she 24. Before I had met her I had no interest in doing any kind of drugs. I was going to school for criminal justice and felt I could have a good future as a police officer. That dream ended when I started smoking. I just wanted her to think that I was cool (spoiler alert, she did not).I hadn't grown up doing a lot of bad things. I hadn't grown up being afraid or wary of the police. So when I drove into a motel parking lot to spark up a bowl (only about a block away from my residence, I had lived with my parents at the time, who were not cool with the MJ). When a cop pulled up to me with his lights on mid bowl hit, I was petrified. The only time I had been stopped by police was for a traffic ticket. Lo and behold, 2 random pills that I had never seen before or heard of in my life materialized in my center console, and I was taken in for possession of a controlled substance. I started selling marijuana to various peoples to pay off my gigantic attorney fee. Fast forward a little bit and I get arrested, again, for having an ounce of weed on me. Since I was driving at the time and the car smelled like weed, I was given a DWAI. I am still working on getting my license back, and in the end it wounded up costing me more trouble than it was worth.",,,0.0

He started to really develop deep feelings for me, feelings that I did not return in kind. I still continued to date him for a time just to hang out as friends, but then about six months ago I broke up with him as a romantic dating partner to move on with someone else. He was very confused and hurt by this event, and accused me of leading him on and giving him false encouragement, so I ended out friendship and I cut off all contact with him. I felt very guilty for presuming to continue to spend time with someone that I knew I felt zero chemistry with just to have a friend to spend time with. I regretted having to be so abrupt and cold when I broke up with this person, too. I wish there would have been a way to remain friends, because he was a nice person and I enjoyed his company on a friendship level. I was resigned to the fact that this would not be possible after the way things happened and evolved with the break up, though. At first I felt bad for being unable to conjure up feelings that just weren't there for him and for hurting his feelings, but eventually I began to see things in a slightly different way. I think it is quite common for people to have a variety of dating experiences that aren't ideal in some form or other while they're out there searching for people they want to be with romantically. There are never any guarantees or promises in romantic situations in the early stages, before there is any kind of commitment made and while feelings are still developing or unclear. Even if I am not the best judge of chemistry, it is not wrong to end a relationship with someone you don't feel a romantic attraction to. I feel that trying to compromise or settle in dating relationships will cause everyone involved to have unnecessary pain and heartache in the end. So I was sorry for hurting anyone's feelings, but I do not regret doing what I did in the end. I did not wrong anyone by dating them and giving them a fair chance, and by being their friend, simply because I didn't ultimately develop romantic feelings for them in the end.",,,0.0

I’ve been scared for this day beings that I didn't enroll my oldest. I spent weeks shopping for school clothes. Her first outfit was a French schoolgirl skirt and a polo. She isn’t in private school, but I want her to be a smart kid that is very involved in her schoolwork. She was so excited; this mommy was so scared. She enrolled late, one because I didn't have her social, secondly because I was so scared. See she isn't my youngest... She’s my second youngest but somehow, I have kept her more innocent than the rest.  What if kids teach her thing, I don't feel she should know. She’s only 5. I didn’t have a chance to meet the teacher much due to her being late. They told me quick goodbyes is the best. That scared me more. On the other hand. She just walked right into that gym. Let go of my hand and found her way with little help from me. I didn’t want to give a quick goodbye what is she was scared? Well she wasn’t scared she just wanted her mommy to go away. That’s when I realized this is much scarier to let my girl grow her wings and her freedom than it is for this mommy to allow her to grow her wings. I know she’s going to fall sometimes. I know she is going to learn things I am not okay with. She’s also nicer than myself to others (which was always my goal) so that mean she is going to get bullied sometimes. I just hope I taught her how to correctly stick up for herself. I hope I taught her right and wrong well enough. Lastly, I hope I have taught her and am still teaching her that I will always be here, If she did something wrong, I will be there to help her, If she falls, I will be there to catch her.",,,0.0

The news was grim as doctors told my extended family members that her organs were failing. I immediately got off the phone and started to look at flights with my husband. Money is tight in our house as my husband is the only one bringing income into our home but we bought a plane ticket to Phoenix so I could see her once last time and say my goodbyes. I reflected and remembered so many wonderful times with my grandmother while I was flying from Atlanta to Phoenix. I was expecting the worst when I got off the flight but in fact my grandmother held on while I was in the air. I met up at the hospital with my parents and my grandmothers organs were back to almost fully functioning. We were able to chat, laugh and remember so many wonderful memories with her as she was awake and coherent. I spent four amazing days with my grandmother in the hospital before having to head back home. I was so touched by how my father helped her in and out of her bed and how he held her hand the entire time we were with her. It was truly so sweet and genuine. With such a grim diagnosis in the middle of July, my grandmother held on for another week and a half before peacefully leaving this earth surrounded by family. I find great comfort knowing that I was able to see her and talk with her. I also feel so at peace that she wasn't in any pain when she passed away.

About two weeks prior to the ride I told a friend that I was going to do it someday.  She blew it off as a ""someday, yeah right"" moment.  The day before the ride, I was supposed to go on a date and the woman at the very last moment cancelled on me... again.  She said she'd make it up to me the next day.  Rather than say ""yeah, no problem"" I went with ""I'm going to busy, I'm going to be naked on a bike in Chicago tomorrow.""  She scoffed and thought I was joking.  That was when I decided, I was going to actually do it.I have a hybrid mountain bike that I use for easy trails around Illinois and pulled it out of my garage.  Checked it out by going for a ride around the lakes near my house.  During the ride, I saw a couple that I knew and we stopped and talked a few minutes.  They told me that they we also planning on going to bike.  Small talk, said hope to see them there and I continued my ride around the lake.Next morning, day of the ride, the woman I was supposed to go on the date with the previous evening text me ""Hey, are you mad at me? Call me"". Conversation ensued as to what my plans were for the night.  She then asked ""are you mad at me?""  I responded with ""No. Can't be really be mad a mosquito when it's just following its natural instincts."" She hung up.I get down to the park where we're supposed to meet at the ""secret"" location.  I get routed to a warehouse where there's about 100 riders all in various states of dress.  Looking around, I realize I didn't bring my water bottle.  I'd left it in my car, I realize I had only parked about a 3 minute ride from it and went back.  On the return trip to the rider assembly area, I see a gorgeous woman taking out her bike from the back of her car.  In passing I tell her that the staging area is this way.  The reason I tell her this is that the ""secret"" meeting location is about 1/2 a mile in the other direction. That's how I met my new girlfriend.",,,0.0

As the two of us tried to enter the door a man stopped us and said we were too late to go in.  It was literally 1 minute after the start time of the performance.  After a few more people showed up he let us in.  The room was huge and had about 200 people laying down on the ground.  The stage was set with crystal bowls and people dressed in some sort of wizardly outfits.  It was vaguely spooky to be there.  The sounds were amazing and so interesting, I've never heard anything like that before in person.  After what seemed like 2 minutes we got up and it was over.  The performance actually lasted 90 minutes!  The sounds were something I had never experienced before.  I would definitely go to see this performance again!",,,0.0

He is involved in the sport, wrestling, that the party was for and also knew many of the other people there. We both had a ton of fun. There were several people there, good food and drinks. Immediately he went over and started chatting with my dad and quickly my dad knew that he wanted me to be with this man. We continued to bounce around and have fun but eventually we headed back to our apartment. At the time we were living together as friends. When we got back we started talking about feelings and what we wanted in the future. Everything seemed to be aligning perfectly. Finally he looked at me and said ""are you in?"" I looked back with a big grin on my face and said ""Yes, I'm in"". Ever since that day we've been nearly inseparable except when he is spending time with my dad.

We were in our evening service, when during it, someone busted through our back doors and into the congregation. It was two gentlemen who had robbed us a year prior. At first we were all uptight, and ready to move, as we could not believe they were back to ruin us again. Well, they didn't. The were dressed nicely, and solemnly walked down the aisle to the front, asked everyone to rise, and apologized to us, and said they had found God. He wanted to go from pew to pew to sahek everyone in the church's hand. A very nice gesture. Along with it, they said sorry to all of us. It was truly touching, and we actually had them baptized later on that night. They have now joined our congregation and we are happy for that. It is not everyday that someone just does a 360 like that. We opened our arms to them after that night, and I think that helped. They are trusting and hard working, and want to truly get better. We as a family, are ready to help them down that tough path. It will be a journey. The true power of God and change has shined through!!!!",,,0.0

They were visiting from overseas so I was showing them around. We went to a place of the Palos Verdes Peninsula in San Pedro. The location is called Cabrillo Beach. There is a pier and a long jetty alongside it that leads to a lighthouse. It was a very dark night and you could see the lights of the port and the homes shimmering on the hillside, but it was so dark that you could not readily identify the people that were walking along the pier. As we were walking along the pier, I could see the bonfires on the nearby beach, it was a surreal look because of the contrast of color due to the darkness around us. There were occasional fireworks shooting off from a park above on the nearby hillside as well, it all gave me a surreal feeling, the colors clashed and really created a festival like atmosphere. I also saw the colors of the fishermen's lures on the water, people walking along the shore with the light from their phones visible, I heard music in the distance. It was a unique type of night. I would talk about the things going on with my family and how this was such a unique experience. The most memorable part however was when a large cruise ship came into harbor. It was off in the distance and got larger and larger until in entered the harbor. The various lights of the ship were glistening, it's reflection on the water lit up the whole area. As it came in I was able to see the passengers on the balconies waving, although we could not see each other I felt the human connection of all the people around me.",,,0.0

I've always wanted to ride a motorcycle across the country while tasting delicious food along the way. It seemed like an idyllic adventure. Many tourists do it and the Top Gear episode on Vietnam was pretty great. In June, I had the opportunity to go and live out that dream. I arrived in Ho Chi Minh City which is still called Saigon there. I will be referring to it as Saigon. I'd been there a couple of times before and it was as chaotic as usual. The first time crossing the street was hard. I'm use to crosswalks, drivers stopping or atleast slowing down, and 95 percent less people on scooters and motorcycles (which from now on I will collectively call motorbikes) . In Vietnam, if you want to get from one side of the street to another, you just walk with confidence and predictability and the motorbikes will just move around you. Traffic in Saigon is madness. So many people, so many motorbikes, so many cars. And rules I didn't read up on. I bought a motorbike. It was a 125cc underbone scooter. Getting out of Saigon sucked. Heavy traffic and lots of exhaust fumes. But once out to Saigon and on a road less traveled, being on a motorbike, even an underpowered one, was incredible.",,,0.0

She was born with Spina Bifida, therefore she's had bladder and bowel issues since birth. She had a bladder rupture that resulted in her stomach filling up with urine. It's terribly painful and life threatening so when we got to the emergency room they immediately prepped her for surgery. This isn't the first time it's happened, it's the third. Her urologist told me that when a patient has that many ruptures, the bladder is no good and they'll have to install an ileochimney. An ileochimney is a stoma created where they pull out part of the bladder and she will have to wear a bag on the outside of her bladder to catch the urine coming out. One good thing about it is that she won't have to catheterize anymore, so that's a bright point. I always cry when she gets sick but this time I really wailed, because I hate seeing her going through pain and knowing it might not be the last time. We were in the hospital for two weeks, and I was there for her every step of the way. Thankfully I have a great support system, so my 7 year old son was taken care of. My daughter is 11, has seen more pain and difficulty than most adults, and is the sweetest person in the world. I do everything I can to protect her and make her happy. She's feeling a lot better though. She's eating well, and in less pain. So from here forth we're just trying to get used to our new routine.",,,0.0

This happened at a previous job I worked for a few months back. At the time I was ushering at a convention center. My responsibility was to greet the people and direct them to their seats for the event. on that night my favorite band was going to be performing. At the time I didn't know they were going to play because I did not thoroughly read about the event prior. They were the last to play onstage. After they had played a few sets it was time for their last song. Before the last song started one of my managers  told me that the lead singer was going to walk by the upper stadium were I was at during the start of the song. This was exciting for me and I almost could not breathe because I really loved the lead singer and was very fond of him. Just as stated before he did walk by were I was as he song the last song. I was so close to him that I patted him on his side to get his attention. He didn't hear or see me because it was so loud in their and security guards were pushing people away from him. Even though I couldn't talk to him I was content with seeing him up close and touching him. After that night I moved on to work some were else. It was the perfect way to end my last night at that job though",,,0.0

She had finished her first year of high school, and was starting her second.  She had changed quite a bit since I had last seen her earlier in the year.  She stood up straighter when she walked, and was more serious, in her face and the way she talked.  She seemed much more like a young adult than the child I had known for so many years.  She had her cellphone, and used it adeptly, like it was never difficult to learn.  She spoke more slowly and more eloquently, and I was able to have conversations about more serious topics with her.  As I talked to her that day, I wondered what she would be like as a 25 year-old adult in 10 years.  I wondered what her career would be, and if she would be married by that age.  I had always liked her as I watched her grow up and change, but this time was different.  For the first time, she was someone I could talk to as a young friend, not just a silly little girl with a short attention span.  I looked forward to hearing her stories about high school and college in the years to come.  I didn't just feel the love that I always felt, but this time I felt respect for the young woman growing up before my eyes.  I also wondered how she perceived me, this middle-aged man that she saw every few months, without really knowing much about him.  Unfortunately, there was also an unexpected change that I did not see coming, one that bothered me and made me uncomfortable.  For the first time, maybe because of my height and deep voice, I sensed that she was afraid of me, something that I never wanted to happen.",,,0.0

My wife hit me and got violent which involved the police arriving at the scene. Since I was in the Army, the Army separated us and I ended up getting very suicidal, which led to me to commit suicide. I was hospitalized and was put on suicide watch for 5 months and had to live in a conference room that the Army provided me. When I was discharged from the Army in June, I was involved in another domestic incident where my wife stabbed me. She was arrested and there was a protection order put in place.  She was released from jail when her mom bonded her out.  While all this happened, I was in the middle of finding a new home. I struggled finding a new home due to the lack of funds, and my bad credit score. I eventually managed to find a cheap home and my mom helped me cosign. I registered for school and had trouble with transportation due to my wife taking the car. My only source of income at the time was Mturk and I used it for Uber. I was fortunate to have met a Veteran that understood my situation and offered to give me rides to school. The next court date regarding my wife is not until October.

I had been a stay at home mother for seven years and earned my college degree while doing so. My last child was entering kindergarten and I knew I would have more free time. I got lucky and was offered an amazing job at my children's school. I prepared myself mentally to adapt to this significant change in my life and I was looking forward to earning an income again (and not just relying on my husband to be the financial provider) and being around other adults regularly. The first week of work was training. It was intense; much more intense than I realized it would be. I felt so out of place and my anxiety was at an all time high. By the last day of training, I was an emotional mess; I felt inadequate, under prepared, and completely out my element. I remember going home and having an anxiety attack which made me feel like I was dying. I was so upset, nervous, and sick that all I could think about was failing. It should be noted, that I am generally a very positive and confident person. I graduated top of my college class with a 4.0 GPA and received glowing recommendations. However, on that weekend, I felt like the lowest person in the world. My anxiety became so overwhelming, my husband was worried that this would do long term damage to my self worth. Monday morning at 6 am, I decided I couldn't do it. On the first day of school, I walked into the principle's office and quit. I felt like I let down everyone around me. It was awful. It was such an emotional day. After a few days of reflecting on everything that had happened, I decided I needed to get some help. I visited my doctor and got on a higher dose of anxiety medicine. Within a week, I was fine. and back to my old self. I decided to learn from this experience and work on my anxiety.",,,0.0

I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.",,,0.0

We loaned them some money to help them start a business in the t-shirt printing industry.  Over the years they worked hard to increase sales and their reputation.  They paid us back in full in May 19.  One evening we were sitting on lawn chairs on the driveway; enjoying some adult beverages.  I pulled out some paperwork from a folder.  My friends asked ""What is all that paperwork you have.""  I explained that it was the spreadsheet I made to track their payments to us over the years.  My friend likes to smoke cigars, so I told him to use his torch.  He looked quizzically at me but complied with my request and lit the paperwork.  We ceremoniously burned the loan paperwork and dubbed it the burning of the business mortgage.  We all had a good laugh about the event for two reasons.  We were all happy that the mortgage was paid off and the excellent single malt whiskey we were drinking.  Word of caution: Don't drink and dri...burn mortgages at the same time.  What a grand feeling it is to get item off of your bucket list.  It's a tradition few people do now.",,,0.0

Some of my brothers friends came too. They were not at the brunch earlier because we did not have enough spots for all of them. At the bar, we spent quite more time drinking. There were some games we could play like basketball, cornhole, and jenga. We had a good time at the bar. After that, we went to another bar. We spent quite a lot of time out in the city.

My now husband has the ability to surprise me when I least expect it.  He proposed on the balcony of our backyard over the ocean looking at the sunset.  We have been renovating his house for quite a few years so it was a special time for him to propose.  We had actually been broken up for several weeks and we were just starting to talk again.   I wasn't expecting us to do much for my birthday, but when I got there after he asked me to dinner he took me up to the balcony and proposed.  After we engaged we decided that we want to get married in Washington DC. This was a special place for us since we had visited there the previous year.  We instilled in the services of an elopement company to help us with our wedding.  We decided not to take any of our family and elope.  They weren't too happy with us, but we wanted to get married (it was the second for him and third for me) so it was more special for it to just be us.  We got married at the DC War Memorial in Washington DC right behind the Washington Monument and next to the WWII Memorial.  It was a gorgeous venue. The government was shut down so we had the opportunity to get married at a monument without a lot of people around, which was amazing.  Our pictures were gorgeous.  It was snowing and it was freezing, but it made for such a memorable event.  I was super excited to be his wife.",,,0.0

They were all excited to see me and they also told me they wanted to get a new cat. The two cats we had while I was growing up had both passed away recently and I know my mom especially since she works from home 4 days a week had been missing their presence. She was against getting another Cat because it was really painful for her when we put them to sleep to the point where she had almost collapsed in the Vet's office. But I think enough time had passed that she wanted another Cat. So that Sunday morning we ate breakfast and then went to a local Cat shelter to look at some kittens. They had a special room where they kept all the kittens. We saw a whole bunch of kittens in the cages we had but there was one that was especially cute. The people at the shelter took him and his sister out of the cage and put us in a room with the two so we can interact with them. The female kitten was partially rambunctious, while the male one was more meek. My parents then stated they wanted the male one but were not going to take the female Kitten for she was too energetic. They were worried about her climbing everywhere and destroying things around the house. You see our old cats were very calm and docile as well as sweet so they were a but put off by the energy level of the female kitten. We then filled out the paperwork, I tried my best to talk my folks into taking both of them since I felt it was cruel to separate kittens but ultimately they had decided against it. It was really great to see my mom that happy again, as her days are now much more full with a little kitten running around the house.",,,0.0

They said they had not. When I asked to review the tapes myself, the tapes didn't exist anymore. Like seriously how sketchy is that lol. I was so mad just about that really.

I was in the car with him and I was driving and this black male came running at my car on the passenger side with a gun at a stoplight. The windows were down and he stuck the gun in the car and told us to get out. My boyfriend Hunter said no and he stuck the gun in his face so he grabbed it and pulled down and got shot in the foot. I know this didn't happen exactly to me, but it has made a huge impact in my life. I have PTSD and I don't even feel comfortable being in the car that it happened in. My ears ring to this day and every loud noise freaks me out. I am still continuing to figure out parenting on my own while he's recovering. I never got to mentally heal or physically heal since it happened two weeks after I gave birth. Not having my boyfriend at home was really tough because I had to do all the feedings all the diaper changes, figure out a schedule and do all these things on my own while he was at the hospital. Now that he's home, my source of income is mTurk and it's stressful trying to do everything I can and still not make enough money to support a family of three. My boyfriend can't pick up my son without being in pain and it hurts me to see. Every time I close my eyes I can see the look on his face when the bullet hit him. The bullet was a hollow point and destroyed his foot. I suddenly had to become a nurse and get taught how to give him injections for the pain medication and learn how to change out his IV bag at home and change the dressings on his foot until it closed up. Being a young mother and now becoming a caregiver as well drains me. I am very depressed, very anxious, and losing hope. I don't sleep because I'm terrified that my boyfriend will stop breathing because he's in so much pain. And on top of that, being paranoid about my newborn son stop breathing in his sleep.",,,0.0

I was just a child, but still I was forced to keep our family secrets. It affected me greatly, and because of those experiences I found it extremely hard to trust people. I wasn't allowed to have friends over like the normal kids, and my parents were often gone on the weekends. They would come back smelling of booze and drugs. Di-spite the circumstances, I still felt loved by my parents until I was a teenager. I never doubted my mother's love for me, but my father was a different story. His negative nature was very hard to deal with. I believe he didn't care for my sense of wit and humor, but one might say he was insecure. Eventually, I came of age and joined the military. It was during that time that my father became abusive with my mother and she finally decided to leave him. She came to the base where I was staying and attempted to gather her mind. I remember how distraught she was. I was unaware of the sheer abuse she had been protecting me from during my childhood. He then collaborated with a group of men from a drug affiliated gang. This was when my father's life went completely south. He began using meth rather than the upscale drugs from before. He was arrested on charges of drug trafficking, and spent a few years in the penitentiary.  Finally, nearing the end of his life, he drank. He drank so much in fact that he gave out on the toilet with a bottle of liqueur nearby.",,,0.0

This was a sad moment because he always seemed to be strong. Kidney failure began a few years ago until they no longer worked without the help of a machine. The news totally shocking as we thought he had more time and also hoped he would recover without needing this machine.  Its bee a few months since he started this process and he has lost a lot of weight. It makes me really sad but I know this is all a part of life and I´m thankful we have the technology today to have him with us for many years to come. Its been several months of changes but in the end we will support him and be there for him with positivism and with a lot of energy as we know this will make him better. My siblings and I talked long about this and about the necessary course of action and we all agreed to be strong for my dad. We need to be there for him, help him with his medicine. My dad is stubborn and doesn’t like others to help him. We need to find a way to be there for him without triggering negative responses. Its been a couple of months filled with challenges. I think about all the families that have similar struggles some of them early on. I am happy to be with my dad, to have him with us. I hope he gets better and we will be with him every step of the way.",,,0.0

We went for a trip to the beautiful hill station last month. It was a nice family trip where we enjoyed a lot. The trip started on a breezy Sunday morning. We hired a van from our home and my uncle’s family accompanied us. We boarded a lodge at 10 ‘o clock in the morning and the weather so cold that we were freezing like a statue. After getting ready with all our jackets over us we went to the Thunder world which was a very different theme zone I have ever seen.  The botanical garden and rose garden were so amazing. It was a great scene to see so many flowers all together. They all looked as if they were smiling at us. The next day we visited Pykara and the boating experience there, was indeed not equivalent to words. The same afternoon we went to Mudhumalai forests and saw wildlife face to face. The trip was so wonderful that it cannot be explained simply in words. The trip to Ooty was definitely one of the most memorable ones in my life. Today my tenth board exam results have been declared. Until 2'o clock, my heart was beating very fast. As soon as I saw my result I felt that I was on the top of this world. I have come first in my school. Everyone was very happy after they came to know my results. My parents were so happy that they ordered lots of sweets and distributed in our neighborhood. I was at the top of the world after I came to know that I was the topper of my school. I will always remember this day as it was one of the best days of my life.  I was away on a long weekend with a group of my best friends, sitting around, drinking and having fun when something struck me. I wondered how this had happened? ​The most healthy person in the room had recently completed an Iron​ ​Man triathlon, so I had a pretty high benchmark to ​meet.  Fast forward a few years​ and ​I have completed 30+ marathons​ and ​ultra marathons and I think I did just fine.- Daniel Da Vinci   I was sitting in my room with some friends when I got a call from my dad's number.

It was a special event for me as I haven't seen them in about 10 years. For the exception of my mother and my younger brother all of my relatives live in Cuba. I had been planning and was very interested in going to see my family for many years, but was unable to because of lack of money mostly because for most of those years I was underage and wasn't able to raise enough money. After raising enough money for my visa and the plane ticket along with all other necessary expenses I would be having on this trip I decided it was time to finally go on this long awaited trip. I booked my flight, told my younger brother about the trip but decided not to tell anyone else as I wanted to surprise them. On the day of the flight I took an Uber to the airport as the only person that new was my underage brother and therefore I had no one that could of drove me there. In the airport things were pretty simple I just checked in and since I just have a small luggage I didn't have to make any long lines in order to check in additional bags. The flight went smoothly as well and about an hour I was in the capital of Cuba. Once I got there I immediately went to the arrival line where a lady asked me some questions and after a short interview I was able to get my bag and check out. Once I walk out the airport doors It honestly felt like I was transported 50 years back. All the cars and structures seemed like they were all from the 70's or older for the exception of tourist rental cars and the occasional modern Kia like small car. Thankfully I was fluent in the language and remembered by previews trips to Cuba as a kid and was able to find a person that guided me to a place in the city where I could rent a car for my week long stay. I drove directly to where my family lived about 3 hours away from the capital with no directions as I remembered how to get there. Seen my family once again was an awesome experience and brought back many memories from my childhood trips. The week went by faster that expected but I was able to see my siblings in the island as well as the rest of my family from both my moms and dads side, as well as experienced a whole other culture. Undeniably, it was a very emotional trip and one I would love to experience again in the near future but next time I'll be taking my younger sibling so he can also experience it.",,,0.0

I dont usually feel that way, I generally wish my trainees well and move on.  I feel I really helped her and made a difference for our company to succeed having trained people step up. I don't know who I will mentor next but I hope they are as smart and nice as she was. It was worth the extra effort as she appreciated it and really what more can you ask of someone. I am worn out though and will enjoy the break. Now I can focus on my tasks that have fallen a bit behind. Maybe I will start a new project. We have made a date though for coffee (starbucks) in a few weeks so I can touch base with her and ensure all is going well.  I think though she will be fine and will hit the ground rolling. I hope all my training pays off.",,,0.0

I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the ""sinner's prayer"" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except ""self help."" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this ""metamorphosis,"" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.",,,0.0

But i was also glad i got to tell her how much i loved her days before she passed. After her funeral we all celebrated and all of us had amazing stories to tell about our amazing loving grandmother. Her side of the family that was still alive came, also my grandfathers side of the family came. All her friends and all the people she has helped over the years also attendant. She also planned weeks before she passed away. Her and my grandfather had a talk and she also wrote letters to each and everyone of us along with a video. She had also planned her whole funeral and i thought that was amazing. The funeral that she planned for her self was great and hope i could do that when its time for me to go. We all celebrated the whole day. People that we haven't seen in years came and i felt like that brought us a bit closer. Ever since that has happened we plan family Friday  twice a month, we all get together and just have fun. One of the moment of that day i will never forget was when it was time to bury her,  when it was time to go down it started to rain so hard out of no where and it stopped when she was finally cover. I thought that was strange but amazing because it made me feel like she was saying goodbye to us. Even though it was sad it was also a good day because the stories that i heard were great and also learned new things about her that i never knew, I will never forget that day.",,,0.0

We were very excited about the first journey. On the second day, we took an elevator to go up for a breakfast buffet. In the elevator, there was a lady and we did strike a small talk about the nice travel. During the breakfast, my wife didn't say anything but just eating. I didn't really know why she was upset and later got to find out that she was very uncomfortable about my talking to the lady in the elevator. She said she felt ignored by me. I said, it was just a casual conversation and I didn't have anything to do with the woman. My wife however kept saying she was unhappy and this trip made her very depressed. I felt upset too because of her ridiculous behavior and mindset. However, I didn't want to ruin the rest of the time, and we made love in the cabin. She was hesitant in the beginning about my signal for having sex, but she seemed to be agreeable on it. It was good, or should I say much better than a normal sex at home partly because of the trouble and getting lid of it by expressing our feeling for forgiving each other. Four weeks after the travel, I was very busy at work and she called me saying she thinks she was pregnant. Oh my gosh! What a nice surprise because we had a hard time having a baby for a long time! We presume that the emotional sex during the cruise made it happen and we were so happy. Life is unpredictable.",,,0.0

Once it was time for our reservation we went inside the restaurant. The manager told us our reservation had been taken by a more favored guest, but they did have a nice spot in the back of the restaurant. As we walk through the door; I see my parents, my wife's parents, my kids, and friends. It was a nice surprise party that made me feel special and caught off guard. My best friend handed me a drink and I greeted all of my guests. We sat down and there were five total courses from the chef. My friends and family each took time to talk to me and even roast me every so often. We stayed in the restaurant after it closed and soon left afterwards. It was a significant event in my life since I normally don't have birthday parties. It was also significant since it included the majority of my favorite people currently living. I felt grateful and appreciated the lengths my wife took to make the party happen without my knowledge. The most memorable moment for me was seeing everyone in the room for our dinner.",,,0.0

I was happy as I was going into a new phase of life.  I would have endless opportunities and be more of an adult. However, I never too the time to look at the downsides. With this feeling of independence came additional feeling of loneliness. I never stopped to think about how my life would change for the worse. Lots of my friends were going to different colleges and different cities.  Many of the people that I grew up, I would no longer see so often again. My entire life in terms of the social relationships that I had formed would go on to change.  I would only really come to the brunt realization when I had to say goodbye to my friends. I had stayed home to go to a local college so I had to watch many of my friends leave.  Also when I saw that many of these friends were going on to make new friends, the situation become even more difficult. I felt like I was being replaced as I was not forming new connections like they were.  I felt like I was still in high school while they were actually moving on.

She checked herself into the hospital with stomach pains and while under observation she developed a brain bleed which killed her. She was 65. When I try to remember the day it happened, when my brothers and I went to the hospital, it feels like I'm remembering a dream. I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life. I imagine the closer you are to the person who dies the more off balance your life becomes.",,,0.0

We left in the morning and first went to the shops went we got into Cherokee and we got awesome new moccasin shoes that were fuzzy on the inside for our lazy few day trip. We drove into the campground after we ate a burger in town for dinner. Pitching the tent was really fun, because my two dogs were attacking the poles as we were trying to set it up; my girlfriend was laughing and smiling cheek to cheek. We got the tent pitched and decided to get the fire started before we brought our supplies into the tent, so I went up to the main office to buy some kindle and firewood. I built a massive fire with the help of my girlfriend and she took all the credit to herself as per usual. She's always proud of herself for funny things like that. We brought a plastic chest full of snacks and supplies so we would definitely not go hungry. Usually couples go out to dinner and date, but we ate out of cans for 3 days! I think this is definitely a main reason why I lover her. We don't have to be like every other couple. We're unique. When we were done there; we didn't want to leave. Neither did the dogs! We watched all of our movies we had downloaded on our computers and drained our powerbank so we couldn't charge our phones, so being a 21st century couple, we went back to civilization!

As I was laying in bed, I got a random message on Facebook Messenger. When I opened the message, I noticed it was from somebody that I didn’t even know. The messages were very rude and racist threatening to kill me and my family. A few years before that, my dad was involved in a shooting (he is a police officer). The person that was messaging me was claiming to be the girlfriend of the guy that my father had shot and killed 3 years previously. I then proceeded to send a text message to my dad to ask him advice on what I should do. He advised me that I should call the police and put in a report. The police ended up showing up and  I put in a report, then we determined that the profile was a fake profile. I decided to do some investigating on my own and messaged a few people to see if they knew who owned the fake profile. Eventually, one of my friends confirmed that the owner of the profile was an old friend of ours. Then I called the police back up to give them the new information. A few days later, the kid that was sending me the threatening/racist messages was arrested on a domestic violence charge involving is father and ended up admitting to sending me the messages when questioned about it. He ended up getting my charge dropped, but he is currently in prison for probation violation on a robbery charge. This situation has stuck with me for the last few months and I think about it every day. The part that stuck with me the most is that he threatened to kill my 1 year old child.",,,0.0

Once the eating finished and we opened the dance floor, I wandered around to talk to everyone to make sure they were having a good time. I remember watching my brother and my mom dancing, and then his wife and her dad dancing, and finally the newly weds. I made sure to stay close by to my older brother, because he isn't married yet and I knew he felt lonely. I also grabbed some cake balls, because yum. When the actual dancing started — like, with everyone — I joined the people on the floor and had a blast. I'm not the best dancer, but I can follow along and can keep rhythm. I remember seeing my brother and how happy he was, and how pretty his bride looked. Even once the dancing started, though, I remember that i was a host and tried to keep an eye on people. I noticed one person in particular who looked lonely, and normally she really likes dancing. Not wanting the day to go badly for her, I left the dance floor and went to talk to her. I discovered she was sad because her own husband couldn't make it, so I said I would dance with her. That made her really happy, and she went back out on to the floor. Once I was satisfied she was okay, I found a couple other people to partner up and dance. I remember feeling so content and like I was serving an important purpose. I'm not normally very extroverted, but I felt like it was my responsibility, you know? We ended the night by having all the groomsmen grabbing my brother and hoisting him over their heads, then throwing him up in the air to crowd surf. He was a little terrified, but he also had fun, so it was an absolute win. I'm so glad everyone had a good time.",,,0.0

She and her fiance(now husband) had a very simple, beautiful wedding in the mountains. They wanted an intimate, small wedding and that's exactly what it was. There were only about 25 guests invited. Several of us camped for the weekend at a campsite area where they held the ceremony. The grooms uncle officiated the ceremony, which made it even more special for everyone. A simple ceremony was held among the trees, while the guests sat in chairs to witness the vows. She was so beautiful and the ceremony so lovely, it made me cry. This was such a significant event in my life and I think about it very often. We now also have the pictures and video of the wedding to enjoy looking at. After the ceremony was a lunch and reception at their campsite. The traditions of cake and cake cutting, dancing, etc was done. Later that afternoon we all drove up to the top of the mountain and the uncle performed a ""hand ceremony"" for them. Beautiful Mount Rainier was in the background. It was very special.",,,0.0

I remember vividly getting my diagnosis & just breaking down. I was diagnosed with not only Crohn's Disease, but also Ulcerative Colitis. From January of 2015 to now, I'm still suffering. 27 feet of intestines removed and over 20 surgeries later. Not to mention during this 13 hour surgery my lungs failed. I was put into ICU on a breathing machine. The impact this made on my life was dramatic. From having my intestines hanging out of my stomach. To feeling the absolute worst pain you can imagine and waking up not knowing whats going on. Overall it was a tough time, but I learned a lot! Looking back it was definitely something I could never forget. Most important it made me into the man I am today. Tomorrow is never promised and you just have to have faith.",,,0.0

It was an exciting experience that I will always remember. I sang 4 song to a crowd of about 200. When I first stepped on stage I was sweating profusely. My teacher( who was playing the piano) smiled at me and reassured me that it would be fine. I started singing an impossible dream and the crowed was stunned at the was I sang the song. I was quite surprised myself. When I sing I take the song into myself and make it a part of me. When I was done singing there were people in the audience who openly wept. My teacher was crying and I found I was crying myself. It took me awhile to regain my composure, but when I did I was in the middle of a standing ovation. I sang many more song that day, but the memory of my first one will always be the best. This will always be my best memory because of the joy I felt at not only being the center of attention but the star of the show. I wonder if people who sing professionally feel like this every time they step on stage. I guess I will find out soon since because of that recital I have had interviews with several opera houses.",,,0.0

We had been wishing to move out of Florida for years, even more so when she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension and pulmonary fibrosis. I worked really hard as a newspaper carrier for about a year to save to get us out of there. I had finally saved enough money to make the big move. We picked a date to move, May 3rd and I quit my job a month before then. I would have preferred to continue working but I developed carpal tunnel in my right hand and it was becoming too painful to both work and pack. After quitting I was more able to focus on packing and cleaning up. We already had an apartment waiting for and even had a down payment. Making the trip up was tough because we were also bringing our 3 cats. However, my grandpa and tio both offered to help and come with us to help with the move. The entire move was done in a rental car and uhaul that my grandpa drove. It was a lot of fun to drive through a lot of states as I have never been outside of Florida before this move. We would not have been able to make the trip and smoothly as we did without their help. The day we arrived it was raining and chilly outside and it couldn't have been more perfect.

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day.

I should start with some backstory. I met my girlfriend in 2017, we had some mutual friends and became friends through them. We instantly hit it off and started a great friendship. That quickly evolved into a romantic relationship within about a month and we began dating in August of 2017. We have had a pretty incredible relationship, obviously not perfect but we always come out of situations on top, together. I knew that I wanted to marry her pretty early into our relationship, but I also knew it was something that I didn't want to rush into. She didn't want to rush into it either. We very much wanted to take our time getting to know one another and just enjoying our lives together. Earlier this year, I decided I wanted to propose on our two year anniversary, and I started getting things set up to do so. I picked out the ring with the help of her sister, who is her best friend, and got on with planning the proposal. I decided the most important place to us would be the perfect place to propose, and that's at a local park where we shared our first kiss. In order to ensure that she didn't suspect anything, I had her sister suggest to her that we go on a double picnic date in that park with her and her husband before we went for our anniversary dinner alone later that night. We would then take some photos together as a group and just the two of us. Since she believed it was her sister's idea, my girlfriend suspected absolutely nothing. When it came time, my girlfriend's sister suggested that my girlfriend and I pose for a couples photo, and as we were stood next to each other, I stepped back, got down on one knee and proposed. She was shocked and overjoyed, and after realizing what was happening, jumped into my arms and said yes. It was one of the happiest moments of my life, knowing that I will be spending the rest of my life with this woman. I know our wedding day will top this, but it was such an amazing day that we will never forget.",,,0.0

These were the last words he said to me…. You know what that “tomorrow” never came. X ( I am hiding the name ) was a good friend of mine. I first saw him in when I was in sixth standard. I guess he was a new admission in the school. He was very silent by nature. As I am a very talkative person so I always tried to persuade him to speak something. But he never changed his habit. Well that was too much annoying for me. Sorry, but I hate those people who always keep silent and don't express themselves. when he started to talk to me without my persuasion. He wasn't a brilliant guy so he often scored average in the exams. His desire to learn more brought him closer to me ( actually I was the topper of my class at that time. ) we became good friends there after. I was in eleventh standard when everything changed suddenly. I remembered that day he was very happy. He was talking to everyone and passing smiles to everyone in reply of a hello or hi. He was acting quite amusing that day. I didn't asked him the reason but I was happy to know he was enjoying his surroundings. Next day when I reached the school, I found that the environment of the class was quite disturbing. Almost everybody was standing in his own respective friend circle and was whispering. I sensed that something terrible has happened. When I enquired about the topic I was told that four of our school students who were coming to school on a motorcycle early in the morning have been brutally crushed by a truck. One of them had died while the rest are still unconscious.",,,0.0

We quickly got all of our things moved over and I was setting up my cat a place in a room by herself so she was not overwhelmed. It all went pretty well really. That night we built a fort and played with the cats, she also has two of them. It was really fun, we both enjoyed ourselves. We laughed and had fun all night.

My stomach immediately dropped. I didn't hear what he said directly afterwards because worry consumed me and I started thinking of all of the things that would be effected. Once I could focus again I asked him if he was serious. He explained that he did lose his job with the company he has worked for for the last 19 years, but that he was being hired by the company they were changing their name to. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry, be happy or mad. He also told me that with the name change, he was going to receive a 15% raise. My mind again filled with different scenarios, but much more pleasant ones. I had been worried about budgeting for braces and this was an answer to my prayers. This would cover our daughter's braces and then some. The amount of stress that would be lifted would make a difference in everyday life. It will change our life, not dramatically, but significantly. What started as a horrible call ended up being a great call that allowed me to relax like I haven't in a long time. I know that everything is going to work out and be okay. I'm still a little irritated at my husband for doing that to me, but all in good fun, I guess.",,,0.0

I have witnessed two seizures when he was with his mother, my daughter.  But I have never been his sole protector and advocate during one.  I have prayed that I would never see the day that I would be alone with him when one happened. But that day came. My husband and I went to their home to babysit so my daughter and son-in-law could go to an evening wedding of a friend.  As my grandson stood at the window waving goodbye to them, he turned slightly towards me and became rigid. I knew that he was about to go into a seizure. I laid him gently on the carpet and turned him onto his side. I told my husband to run outside and try to flag them down. I grabbed my cell phone to note what time the seizure began.  I made sure he was breathing. He jerked slightly for about a minute, and then his body relaxed and he gave a big sigh.  It was over. My husband had been able to stop them, and they all came in around that point. My grandson was very confused, and then became  sleepy, so my daughter held him for a long nap. I was very emotionally drained afterwards.  When someone has a seizure they are totally defenseless and helpless. My grandson's frailties and vulnerabilities was driven into me that evening.  It was a traumatizing event for me.   If someone near you has a seizure, you must act to help them. Get them safely to the ground, otherwise a fall could be very injurious or even fatal. Turn them to their side to keep the airway open. If they have been eating, clear the mouth. Note the time, and call for help if it goes over two minutes.",,,0.0

We had been dating for three years and living together for one year.  I thought the time was right for us to take the next step in our relationship but didn't know how to go about it.  I thought about it for weeks on how to propose and more importantly where to propose.  The first time we met was at a park and I thought that would be a good place to ask her to marry me but I thought twice about it.  I then thought of the first date we had which was hiking at a local trail near our home.  Since we both love to hike I decided to propose to her while we were hiking but instead of doing it at our local trail I decided to go for a hike in Griffith Park.  In Griffith Park they have a great hiking trail on Mount Lee which leads you to the top of the Hollywood sign.  We got there really early in the morning and made our ascent up the mountain.  I didn't realize how long it was going to take.  After climbing for three hours we finally made it to the top completely exhausted.  Once we were there I got on my knees and asked her to marry me.  I could see the joy in her face as she said yes.  It was a great feeling something that I will never forget.  Knowing that I picked the right woman made it more special.  We both cried tears of joy and enjoyed the rest of the day celebrating our engagement!,,,0.0

My daughter, whose in her teens, had a very close relationship with her. I tried for months, to get her to work things out, but nothing that I tried or did, worked. I felt hopeless, utterly broken. I later found out, that the last year of our relationship she was seeing someone, and it further drove me into a downward spiral. But as they say, time heals all things. A few months ago, my ex reached out to me out of the blue. We had spoken before, briefly, but nothing of substance. Her texts through me for a loop, and for a moment, I felt like my prayers had been answered. She told me how she had missed me, my family, and thought about us a lot. After an exchange of texts for a few days, we met up, and it was the first time since our divorce, that I had seen her and it was like I was seeing her for the first time all over again. I told her how I felt about things, after finding everything out, how much it hurt, but also, that I still cared for her and there is nothing that could hold me back from wanting to give us another try. I thought things were looking up, I felt great. We went out on a few dates and things felt good. However, she was moving about an hour away, taking a new job and buying a house. I told her again, how I felt about her and she told me she wasn't in the same place. Ultimately, this hurt me quite a bit, and I felt like I was right back to where I was. Why did she text me to begin with? Did she want to know that I'd still be here? Things stopped after that, and we exchanged texts only occasionally, until she moved. I told her good luck with everything and to let me know if she ever needed anything. In those moments, I felt like we could be working towards something great, only to be left yet again, by the same person. Its been four months now and although I think about her from time to time, I believe things worked out for the best.",,,0.0

She said maybe. A couple days before the festival I asked if she had her schedule. To find out if she would be able to make it. She said she would be able to make it, and we can meet up there. She didn't give a set time she would be there. So I spent the entire day at the festival. Around mid day she showed up in her work uniform. I asked her if she was just getting off work. She looked frustrated, almost to the point of tears when she told me she was just heading in. They had suckered her into taking an extra shift that night. But she wanted to let me know she wouldn't be able to make our date. I was disappointed, but touched that she wold come down in person to tell me that. A few minutes after she left, I felt a small hand at the small of my back. I turned and it was her. She was frantic. She had lost her key and was wondering if I had seen it. I immediately offered to help her look. She took off towards her car, and I followed, looking around. Her friends spotted her running off in a frantic state, with a man following her. They came running after us, they calmed a bit after hearing about the key, but they still stayed between the two of us for the rest of the search. As we were almost to her car I spotted the edge of something black at the under a thick bush. It was her key! She was so happy to have it back that she threw her arms around me to hug me. The look of happiness on her face as she did is something I will never forget.",,,0.0

This actually just happened 2 days ago. I am a senior in college majoring in nursing, and have worked hard the past 3 years to do well in my classes and get good grades. As a result, I have a high GPA (3.9) and so I was eligible to join the Honor Society. It started with an email sent to me inviting me to join. Once I decided to join, I signed up online and paid the fee. What was extra special was that my parents offered to pay the fee for me because they knew it was important for me to join and they wanted me to be recognized for all my hard work. Then, this past Monday was the induction ceremony. I was a little disappointed because my parents were unable to attend, but two of my friends came instead. I dressed up in a nice dress, picked up my friends, and we went to the ceremony. There was a speaker who presented her research project, and then it was time for the induction. One of my professors read off all of our names (only 7 people in my class were invited to join), and we all went up individually to sign our names in the booklet, receive a certificate, and receive purple cords that we will wear at graduation. Afterwards we took pictures and ate cake. It was a really special night and it was nice to be recognized for my hard work. I appreciated my friends coming to support me. I am proud of myself for this accomplishment and for almost making it through nursing school.",,,0.0

When I turned the key it was apparent this was not going to be a normal day as I was greeted with a ""rrrur rrurr"". After a few more futile key attempts I popped the hood and noticed corrosion on battery terminal. No big deal, I'll just remove the corrosion and will be good to go, which I did and I was, until the next day. To my frustration I was greeted with the same ""rrur rrur"" the following day. Again, popped hood took a look not really any new corrosion, but i thought maybe the inside of the terminal connectors needed cleaning. While removing said connector it broke, not good. The corrosion had weakened the metal causing it to be brittle. No big deal, i'll just go get a new connector, which I did. Installed new connector and all was well in the world again, or so i thought. Three days later was again greeted with the too familiar ""rrur rrur"" when attempting to start the car after walking out to said car with groceries. Had to get a jump and limped back home. Back to the drawing board trying to decipher the car code. Decided the cheaply made recently purchased battery terminal connector was the issue, so got a stronger and better made one. Unfortunately while in the process of replacing said connector a small cable from the battery was accidentlly severed. After replacing the connector we now had to trace the small cable back and replace that. Finally done with all! Until I went to start the vehicle and heard the frustrating ""rrur rrur"". Stumped, frustrated, angry, happy, sad, all emotions under the sun, finally decided to replace the battery (that was tested by a shop that said it was a little low but ok). After replacing the battery peace was once again restored to the kingdom! All told, 7 days to fix the issue. Why not take it to shop some may ask? That takes money and we had none. The end.",,,0.0

I uploaded it to my YouTube page which I had built up to a decent subscriber count. Within 24 hours, my song had amassed over ten thousand views. I was astounded. I couldn't believe my music had resonated with this many people this quickly. I felt deeply touched by the fact that my dreams were coming true before my very eyes. This experience motivated me to make even better music. It also showed me that I am more than capable of making it big as an artist. I produced, engineered, wrote and recorded the entire song myself which made it feel all the more satisfying.",,,0.0

I was really excited about this gig because it was difficult to get, it payed really well, plus I got our whole band of 10 people free drinks as well as nice meals from this hotel club gig. We arrived at the venue around 6:30pm, as the booking agent had requested for a sound check. The venue was beautiful, and as it turns out, has a great reputation and is a valued spot to get into. We set up, ran our sound check with most of the band, except our new saxophone player. She showed up a bit later, but still in time to get some sort of sound check. She asked about dinner and myself and our two singers handed her a menu. I told her that her meal is compt, but her boyfriends would not be. This was the first time any of us had ever seen her boyfriend, or even heard of him existing, but we didn't think too much of it because she'd only been playing with us for a few months. We all eat, then it's show time. We play our first set, the people love it, so does the booking agent. We take a set break, then return to the stage for set 2 of 3 for the night. Also well received.  We take our second set break, and suddenly, our saxophone player says she has to go and didn't know we were playing ""so late"".This seemed very strange to all of the rest of us, as the whole show should be done in another hour, which still would be relatively early, by usual musician standards. Her announcement was made even more strange by her ""boyfriend"" standing arms crossed, looking very menacing at everyone, telling her repeatedly, ""we got to go"". She seemed under duress. Her mouth was saying things that didn't match up to her body language. This made things very uncomfortable for everyone, except her boyfriend, who was bad vibing everyone. I immediately thought out the many ways this could go down, and decided to not argue, but just to let her go before the start of our last set of the night. We were all very upset by this, but after she and her boyfriend left, we all talked about how letting her go was the best thing to do, and also a fire able offense at a gig. On top of all of that drama, the boyfriend ate for free, and we got stuck with the bill at the end of the night! Just in case she was being abused by this boyfriend, we told her family what had happened, and how it all seemed really strange to all of us, male and female in the band. Never heard from her again, and not sure what ever happened. It made me sad though, as I did like her, and had looked forward to making music and a friendship with her.",,,0.0

This is what I was looking forward to. You see we live in California so we do not get many holiday's with immediate family on my husband side.  Texas is where his parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, and so many more. Our child got to have a fun filled holiday with everyone, especially her grandparents.  Everyone came, there was so many people there that we love and cherish.  I got to meet a lot of new family members.  What makes this the best was my child got to spend time with her family. I will always remember this day because this is the day that I felt more welcomed into this huge family.  Great food with great people and some fireworks at the end. This is one of the best July the 4th's ever.  I hope to have many more holidays with our family.",,,0.0

The daughter had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to work for a university there. She was hesitant about leaving the university she had worked at for over 10 years in North Carolina. The elder and his wife received a phone call stating their daughter had passed away. She had just accepted this new job in April of this year. It was hard for everyone to believe that less than six months later this young lady would be taken away. The university in North Carolina where she worked honored her life on their campus. The young lady was responsible for securing grants for students and underprivileged individuals to attend the university, who without her efforts would never have been able to do so. She worked in the same capacity at the new university in Atlanta. The boss the young lady worked for recounted her last day here on earth, as she was the last person to be with her. Though it was a painful recollection, it also painted a picture of the daughter's last hours on earth. The boss said they enjoyed a beautiful sunny day and that the daughter had been happy and was doing what she did best; helping others. There wasn't a dry eye in the place after her very vivid and poignant memory of their last encounter. She even spoke of a selfie that was taken of the two of them that was the last picture the young lady took before passing on. If you didn't know this young lady personally, after the tributes given at her celebration of life service, you were made to feel as if you'd known her your entire life.",3QY7M81QH88VD92TS5UGZQOMB6S7K5,,0.0

I literally had to depend on my spouse for feeding, me, doing all the cooking and cleaning, all the house maintenance, getting me bathed and all the laundry. So many things you take for granted when you are mobile, it's hard to express how helpless and dependent you feel, when unable to do the simplest thing for yourself. I was so grateful to have the kind loving support of my wife of 35 years to help me when I needed it. We were also surprised by the generosity of our new neighbors, as we had just moved into the neighborhood a few short months before. Everyone started bringing us food, like, a lot of food!. We ate on it for at least a month, having put several things away in the freezer. They were really a godsend. When I finally was able to put some weight on my foot, I transitioned to a knee scooter for awhile to help me get around, as walking was still slow and painful. Several months of physical therapy was extremely helpful. I also belonged to a gym with a pool where I was able to gently exercise my new ankle. This month is my six months post op appointment. I am walking and gardening again (my favorite) hobby. I am very pleased with the outcome so far. Having had this surgery, I would recommend it.

He was a very active and fun person that was getting ready to retire in the next year from work. He was a very active golfer and loved to fish. He had many groups of friends and was very active for being 65 years old. A group of us would go on a guy’s vacation trip twice a year to the mountains and to the ocean. We would rent a place, play golf, water ski, shoot guns and play some poker. We did this tradition for the last 8 years. We had such great fun with our group that was from the ages of 30 to 70 years. It was sad to see him develop cancer. He went downhill very quickly. The cancer was very aggressive and he made it about 4 months before he passed due to complications. He was a military veteran and we had a wonderful celebration of life starting at the military cemetery. The funeral was sad but wonderful to reflect on all the stories about Steve’s life and how he carried himself. We proceeded after his ceremony to his favorite sports bar to celebrate his memory. It was fun to catch up with some of the other people in his groups of friends and family that I did not know.

We haven't moved back to my home town, but a couple of hours away. I had a friend who I'd known since I was a kid - we were friends all through elementary school and high school, and then I started touring with my band and we fell out of teach. Over the last decade or so I've searched for him just about every way - Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, just plain Google. I never found anything. A few weeks after we'd moved back and I started a new job I stopped in a gas station on my way to work to grab an energy drink; it was maybe 6:30am. I checked literally 3 times that my eyes didn't deceive me, but there my friend was. At 6:30 in the morning, in the same gas station, several towns over from where we both grew up. I was blown away. I walked all the way up to him before I said anything because I just couldn't believe it was happened. As soon as I said something he looked right up and recognized me, and straight away we started talking and catching up. He hadn't been in town longer either - maybe a year - so we were both kind of dumbfounded to see each other at all, nevermind in such a random place at a random time. We exchanged numbers and it turned out he'd tried to find me a few times over the years too. We've both gotten married and he has a few kids. We still haven't actually caught up in person over a beer but we will do soon.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6PZ4970,,0.0

He mentioned the friend in casual conversation after I had asked him several times to no longer talk about him. This caused a serious argument between us, during which he accused me of ""going off the deep end"". He used my mental health issues (anxiety and depression) as ammunition in this argument. His use of my mental health to support his position really hurt my feelings for several reasons. The most important of those reasons being that he and I had begun sharing our mental health issues with each other. Our issues had not been something we have been able to really discuss in the past. I thought we had reached a point where I would be able to share things with him and we could understand each other in that way. The ""friend"" in question never really did anything serious enough to me to warrant getting the law involved, but it had bothered me for several years. In years past, my father was aware of the issues and stopped being friends with the person in question. I am not sure why he suddenly decided that what the ""friend"" did wasn't an issue anymore. It really hurt my feelings that he seemed to have decided that my feelings were no longer important. He claimed I should get over it because it had been several years since the incidents happened. I tried to explain to him that I was mostly over the past incidents, but it was difficult to not think about him when the person in question was brought up on a regular basis. This didn't really seem to matter to him. Instead, he was more interested in doing whatever he could to not think about this problem. I am still not sure how our relationship will be fixed, even after all this time.",3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE,,0.0

This was a big event for our household, as our child has always been in my care exclusively.  It felt painful to send her away for a 6 hour school day. I wondered if she was happy, listened to, understood,  if she was hungry for a snack that she was accustomed to having, if she made friends, who she played with at recess, etc. I kept busy at home with my younger daughter,  but our routine was fractured. My daughter was missing her big sister,  and I was missing my big girl who helped me with her little sister.  During the first week of school, I reminded myself that this was my big girl's new chapter in life, her journey to growing into a big kid. This right of passage was to be expected,  and that we all have survived without our parents watchful eyes. I found it interesting that we spend so much of our child's early years carefully watching over them, only to have to release that nurturing grip to a stranger. As funny as it sounds, I had think back to my years in elementary school. I considered what my parents had to do, releasing my care to strangers, and it helped me bridge this new chapter that I was on the other end with my child. I was able to better prepare my child and myself for this new schedule. The daily pep talks calmed my inner mama bear. I no longer fought with anticipation to camp out at her school, just a good joke to remind myself that she was fine and I would be as well. Now that she is 3 months into this new routine, we are satisfied, she is in love with her school, and I feel like the competent mama bear that I knew I would be.",374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSD98QYR,,0.0

My PC is my life, I use it to work home and for my entertainment. Video games, music, watching movies, those kind of things are what I meant by entertainment. So you can understand just how important this computer is to me. Now when it comes to what I make, I'm usually well off enough that I can cover an emergency springing up out of nowhere. However around this time I believe funds were limited and I was just barely getting by with a few earnings saved here and there. So you can imagine how freaked out I was when I noticed my computer wouldn't boot. I had to test out my equipment at a friends house, which lead me to the conclusion that my CPU was causing the issue. At that time I thought I was screwed, I was using an older version of Intel's i5 CPU and they stopped selling those years ago. Buying used on E bay was a shot in the dark because the prices were high and you could never tell about the quality of the item until after you bought it. Lets just say I've had some bad experiences with E bay and used items. Anyway, just when I thought my luck was down and out some of my family members came to my rescue and loaned me the money I needed to purchase a new CPU. I don't recall if I mentioned this in the last diary entry I did about this subject, but not only was I able to afford a new CPU, they also gave me enough money to buy a new motherboard and ram as well. My old motherboard was using DDR3 ram while the new ones moved on to DDR4. They wanted me to buy a brand new CPU with a new motherboard and ram as well which was a huge surprise. I was so thankful to those family members that stepped in and helped me when they didn't have to. To this day I'm still very grateful for having such an amazing family. Also a little update on the story, since then I've paid them back fully for what they did. They didn't want to accept it at first, but I insisted that they had to accept my payback.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTGNSIU8,,0.0

All sort of interesting things to climb were scattered  about on the lowest level, including a big spiderweb of ropes to climb. This merriment has a backdrop of giant hills, a few peaked by interesting art sculptures. Our family played and played, we climbed those hills with joy. I was so surprised when I found there was a super fun zip line that had me whooping with happiness. My husband had a blast on it too. My kid that was old enough did one slow easy turn, with great encouragement. We picnicked after we had played and played for a while. We had yummy chicken salad sandwiches and cookies.

Pets are family and should be treated as such.  A friend gave us Maggie when my children were 3 and 5. I was a single parent at the time and she was a great addition to our little family. She was just a kitten and loved to play. Maggie grew up with  my children. When I started dating my current husband he ""hated"" cats (so he said).  A few years later, my kids and I were set to move in with my then boyfriend (now husband). The deal was to have Maggie fixed and declawed and she would be fine to come along.  My children are now 21 and 24. They never knew life without Maggie.  She played with us and gave us tremendous joy. We all loved her, even our dogs.  Now she's gone and I miss her.  We buried her in the back yard and planted flowers on her grave.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFRK312D,,0.0

That makes her zodiac sign the crab and mine the ram, not meant to get along without a lot of work, but we get along fantastic - so much for that. She speaks quite directly, and it's very relaxing and reassuring. Wasn't so direct about that crush for a few months, though. I'd first started talking to her because I admired her art, and she admired my writing - not that you'd know it from this kind of diary entry. Bit more comfortable with fiction I suppose. Anyway, we'd spent a few months chatting online, flirting a bit but ambiguously so, you know, like you could read more or less into it, whichever way you liked. Anyway, we'd both developed massive crushed on each other of the course of chatting - though she's told me since that she'd been pining a bit even before we started talking, that was cute - so it was nice to finally have that stated. Feelings mutual. And it's only been a couple months, and it's a long distance thing, but it's been working unbelievably well since then. All the little things, waking up to texted good-mornings and listening to her voice saying good night every night, chatting while we watch shows together, sorting out travel plans. Really quite remarkable given that she's ridiculously out of my league. Talented, thoughtful, gorgeous, ambitious, much smarter than I am - she's incredible. And somehow she's enjoying spending time with me. Go figure.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG015VCKG,,0.0

It had been raining quite a bit recently, so the service berry bushes were full.  We enjoyed eating service berries as we walked.  All along the pathways, especially when there was tall grass on either side, were a large number of dragonflies flying around.  I knew that there is a spring of water in the area, but I hadn't seen so many flying around at one time before!  We noticed a female deer resting among tall grass, but once she saw that we were no threat, she remained where she was.  We also saw ravens in a tree playing with little sticks. The weather was very nice that evening; it was nice to be outside with my spouse enjoying the fresh air. There was an avenue of blooming trees that we walked along, so fragrant.  The trees were also apparently full of wasps and bees, because they were buzzing so loudly!  Apparently we weren't the only ones enjoying the fragrant trees.  One thing that happened during the walk was that a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp it had caught!  It was big (both insects), and I was surprised to find out that dragonflies ate wasps. The dragonfly landed only briefly, and then flew away.  It was a really wonderful, memorable walk.",3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFT9EOUN,,0.0

My grandmother used to tutor my grandfather in school. When he first saw her,  he thought she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. ""She had long dark hair and was carrying her books in her arms as she walked down main street."" Not long after their tutoring sessions ended, they began a courtship and quickly fell in love.  It was the 1930's and they were young and poor. My grandfather couldn't afford to purchase a wedding ring for my grandmother. She didn't much care about a ring but my grandfather desired to give her one. Many years later,  my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a Fitzgerald, Georgia. On their fifteenth wedding anniversary my grandfather drove my grandmother to his store and had her pick out a wedding set. She chose a modest round cut diamond solitaire and a matching diamond fishtail band. She was very fond of the rings and would only wear them on special occasions that required formal attire. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now but I often think of how determined my grandfather was in getting the rings. He only had an 8th grade education but in his lifetime he owned a Standard Oil filling station, a jewelry store, and was a brakeman for the railroad. Last year on my birthday my mother came over to bring me a card and a gift.  She handed me a little velvet box that had my Grandfather's jewelry store name embossed on it.   I shed some tears as I opened the box to see my grandmother's rings.  They were more beautiful than I remembered.  I was so deeply touched that my mother wanted me to have them.

Improv was always something I felt passionate about from a young age and wanted to be involved in but geographically there was no group or avenue to show that. Now, in a new city with new people, I was able to build relationships in the improve community and then merge that with the stand-up comedy group that consists of some of the greatest comedic minds and friends I’ve met to date. I started writing my own stand-up shortly after getting involved with the standup group and after a few months of writing, I performed my first set at a brewery in front of about 30-40 strangers. The event was set up as a pretty structured open mic night that I’d signed up for earlier in the week. There were 13 other comedians performing that night, with varying levels of experience but all more seasoned than I would have considered myself to be. The host of the night announced before the first comic went on that tonight would be arranged a little differently. Tonight there would be a cash prize for the audience’s favorite comic. This definitely made me feel more nervous as I felt like all the other comics would really up their game. I was shaky and unsure of myself but when the host called my name to go on, my worry washed away. I simply stood up and performed what I’d written and worked so hard on presenting. I believed in what I did and I was proud no matter the outcome. I even did some crowdwork and I made the audience laugh on several occasions. After the performance was over, the audience clapped and cheered as the host held his hand over each individual comedian, signaling how much they liked each person’s material and presentation. When his hand got to me, the cheering and yelling seemed to blast so loudly that this sensational wave of adrenaline and excitement went over me. I hadn’t expected to win or even to do really well, but just to pursue something I’d wanted to do for a long time and I wanted to share my material that I believed in. I was awarded the cash prize and several other comics and audience members approached me after the show and asked me to be on their podcasts, perform at other shows/spaces, and what my writing process was. I was so honored and the feeling of adrenaline kept me up almost all night long. I still have the cash I won from that night in a box in my room at home as it serves as a reminder not only of what I won, but what I gained as a person that night in esteem, in hope, and in faith that I can be me again.",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY79MEH0R,,0.0

It was not a planned retirement. The management harasses employees on a daily basis and makes the job a miserable place to be. After months of going to counseling and being medicated by a psychiatrist, my husband decided he had to leave. Several other older employees left the job as well due to the constant stress was making them ill.  So now he and I are both at home, at least for now. His pension money is coming in monthly so we're able to pay our mortgage and car payment. We've seen a financial counselor which has helped a lot. Our 401K money has been mostly invested in a variety of stocks except for a small amount that we kept out for living expenses. Since we've received some money, we have more time to decide what to do. I'll probably will take a part time job somewhere but I'm less stressed than before and I don't feel rushed. My Turk earnings help me make extra payments on my credit cards and I'm making progress in paying them down. We often see the mail trucks in our neighborhoods speeding down the streets. They are driving unsafely but they are afraid of being written up by their bosses. The job wasn't always like it is now. The Postal Service has GPS now so they can track each employee all day. The postal worker is given a few minutes only to deliver a package and the majority of their workload consists of packages, not letters. Employees used to be able to stop and talk to their customers and they usually knew if anything was wrong. My husband even saved a customer's life once because she had cut herself so he wrapped her arm up while they waited for the ambulance. Now they aren't allowed to stop except to drop the mail quickly and get going again. More employees are falling, getting bit by dogs and having accidents because they are rushed.",3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC,,0.0

Overall i was happy for it because well it was something fun? who would not enjoy something that is a fun and good time out with people.  i was looking forward to this since then and planned many since then. As nights out are not something that can be done daily. As fun as that could be but overall it is a highlight for me. Like so many things can be mundane. And not be what you really want them to be when you go out. its good that something at least is what it should be nothing more nothing less. Which since the time of the event i have done it a couple more times. And i plan to go again somewhere else again as drinking and kicking the bucket with friends with a band playing awesome music. Is some of the best moments i have had though that night was in paticular better. Because the bands that played killed it so hard. They were heavy hard and just ripped through their sets. Plus their were so many of them which was a good turn around.,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,,0.0

When that sixteen-hour road trip includes torrential thunderstorms nearly the entire time it's even worse. To say the drive from Chicago to Connecticut was stressful is putting it mildly. When we pulled up to the beautiful, historical boarding school where my daughter would be living for the next few months we all knew it was worth it. The school was originally built in the late 1700s and the original buildings are just as beautiful and imposing as they were hundreds of years ago. Any residual trepidation I had about leaving my young daughter here slowly flew away with the light breeze in the enormous oaks in the quad. We got our room assignment and found my daughter's room. As we made our way up the three flights of stairs to unpack her, we realized immediately how tough a New England summer without air conditioning was going to be. She was so excited, she didn't even notice. We made our way into her new room and met her roommate and their family and thankfully it was a great match. After we got everything unpacked and set up, it was time to say goodbye. I've never left my kids before, especially so far away and for an extended period of time. I had been preparing for this moment for months. I told myself I had to be strong for her. As I leaned in to kiss her goodbye, and saw her admiring her new pointe shoes from the corner of her eye, I knew everything was going to be just fine. With a big wave and grin she yelled ""bye mommy!"" as I walked out the door, and I didn't shed a single tear.",3VHHR074H436XFKBD56HEQ11YHTL72,,0.0

He is ten years old and has big mischievous eyes and curly brown hair. His favourite food is masala data and he loves to cat ice-creams. He runs very fast and always wins lots of medals for his school. He is the captain of his school athletics team, lie also loves to read books, watch movies and play video games. John stays in Newyork and visits us in the summer holidays every year. When he visited us last year, we had a lot of lint by joining a swimming camp and taking guitar lessons together. I am very excited because my mother has promised that John.  I can celebrate our birthday this year by throwing one big party for all our friends. I have so much fun whenever John visits that I sometimes wish that he stayed near us so that I could him meet him every day and we could study in the same school together!

I was inspired by the new coach at our gym to compete much more frequently. I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random. But the lessons I learned in preparation were eye-opening. I came out of this experience a stronger person.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254ZIGJQW,,0.0

It was something I knew I would eventually do, but did not think that I would need for a while longer. I hated going home to a house that was empty of the wonderful greeting that a dog gives you. I have always wanted a Brussels Griffon, it is a hard breed to find. I love the idea of adopting, it is what I have always done, but with research I realized that would not be an option for this breed. It took about a month of searching but through hard work and good luck I was connected with a Breeder that lives 2 hours north of me.  She had a litter of puppies that would not be ready yet and a 5 month old that she wanted to keep for herself. She is a breeder that also shows her dogs and he was her pick of the litter. He had a medical issue that prevented her from showing him, she would have kept him but thought I would make a good home. I have no desire to show a dog, I just wanted to bring a treasured family member into the home. I got my new baby when he was 5 months old, he is the happiest, sweetest little boy and he makes me so happy. He reminds me of my dog that I lost while being his own personality, he keeps me busy. I am distracted from the loss of Ginny by all of the attention that a new puppy demands. There is potty training, going to obedience classes and taking him on more frequent walks, I haven’t been this busy in a while. I never forget Ginny, my little girl who passed, but he fills the void she left and makes the house alive again. It was love at first sight for me and he has one of the best natural dispositions of any dog I have ever had, he is such a joy.",3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQEL747J,,0.0

This time she had told my brother and my mom that she was going to be coming over. I was working on the computer whenever she sent me pictures of my city. I was confused to why she was sending me that so I checked my front door camera and I saw car. It shocked me since she told me that she was going to be having a meeting out of town and she has before. When she arrived we spent it many different places just enjoying each other's company. It was really fun going all over town and showing her around. I also enjoyed her at my house while we played video games or us watching videos. It was a great experience and I thank her for randomly surprising me. She had originally wanted to stay for 5 days but she ended up staying for 8 days. During the last day she was crying a bit and was sad that she was not going to be seeing me for a few months. Because of that our goodbyes were very tough to do. We finally did it and I thanked her for coming over. Once she had left and time passed by we planned a new time for us to see each other. Thankfully that we will be seeing each other in a short amount of time.,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDOYFMGQH,,0.0

The first month was heart wrenching. Every time I look around I see a shadow of him everywhere. I missed him tailing me wherever I go. With a sinking heart I took out the batteries of the laser light, he loves chasing the red dot. What still trouble me was that I did not realized how much an impact we have on each other. Little did I know then that he was part of my world, but I am the world to him. It is when he tore my bedsheet and shredded only on my side of the bed that I realized that he was actually trying to dig for me. He could not understand why I left him for five weeks, which would almost be half a year in cat’s years. It was uncanny, my comforter looks unruffled but underneath, you can see the torn bedsheet. When I pass by a cat on my walks, I always made eye contact and think about Ashton. He was incredibly smart. I totally missed him at the window going out to work and his goodbyes and greetings at the garage door downstairs. I thought we might get another cat one day. Not now, I am still sad. I do continuously read about cats everyday on my iPad, and look at animal shelters online. I also check out Craig’s list periodically. I love and missed Ashton and where he goes a part of me goes with him.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXIVELBV,,0.0

This was his first visit home after enlisting in the Army. I was so excited to see him and I was so relieved when he was finally sitting beside me in the truck for the drive home. I was so filled with pride when I saw my son in his Army uniform standing in the airport. He looked so grown up, more so than one would expect after just the passing of several months. I can tell just by how he stands straighter and taller, with his shoulders back and his chin held high, that he is proud of himself too. Starting in the truck on the ride home, I was so full of questions and so eager to hear about my son's experiences. I needed reassurance, as a mom, that my son was doing all right and that the Army was treating him well and fairly. Seeing my son looking fit and happy did a lot to give me this reassurance and to dispel the worries that I had been feeling after hearing of problems my son had been having with certain people during Basic Training. At one point, it looked uncertain he would even successfully complete the training. But now, seeing him, I knew everything would be okay. As my son shared his stories, he could laugh about some of those experiences with the perspective gained by the passing of time. Now, he was collecting his own stories, and I'm sure there would be more to come. I could laugh as well, instead of feeling the ache of wanting to protect my son from pain, emotional and physical. Seeing my son now gave me such hope for his future. It made me feel like everything would be okay, and helped balance the worries and headaches my son had given me as a rather troubled kid, drifting without any concrete goal in mind, after high school.",3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLM2OE63,,0.0

We started off the day by cooking up some food and having a nice cookout on this day. We had some burgers and some typical 4th of July foods. We spent the day together as a family really just having a nice time together talking and catching up. Then it started to get darker outside and we began to shoot off some fireworks. All of our neighbors also take part in this as there really is a fireworks show right above our house.  We took her outside and at first she acted a bit scared because of all the noise. After a little bit though she relaxed and began to enjoy seeing all of the lights in the sky and hearing the noise. She was really having a great time seeing all of these things for the very first time and it reminded me how much something like this can mean. It took me back and made me enjoy the 4th more than I have in a long time. I really enjoyed watching how she reacted to each huge firework that exploded in the sky above her head. She was throwing her hands in the air and screaming in joy about how much fun she was having with all of this. We really had a great time on this 4th showing this little girl what this holiday was all about. She had a great experience with the entire thing and really enjoyed her first one. She couldn't stop smiling as she was having the time of her life during this event.,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YLNY1,,0.0

She'd grown a tumor several years before and we were always happy that it didn't cause her any issues and she was able to stay with us. Then she got sick. She wasn't able to keep food down. She was throwing up even water. She got weaker and weaker so that she couldn't even make it outside anymore. We knew the end was coming and even though, since her tumor developed, we knew it would happen, we weren't ready to let her go. In her later years, she'd developed some anxiety and didn't like to be away from the family. So, rather than take her to the vet, we kept her at home so she'd be calm. We stayed with her round the clock, petting her and talking to her and letting her know how much we loved her and how grateful we were for her being with us and letting us love her. In the early morning hours a few days after she first fell ill, she passed away in our arms. She went peacefully and with us there to say goodbye. We prepared a spot in the backyard, which she loved to spend time in, so she'd be in a happy place for her and close to us forever. She has a nice spot that gets plenty of sun because she loved to lay out in the sunshine and just soak up the rays.

We just celebrated our first Christmas without her but she still has her place in all our hearts and we think of her often.",3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLGR8Q45,,0.0

The most memorable part about this birth was how difficult and dangerous it was for my wife and daughter. My wife struggled very hard to push our daughter out. This was surprising and concerning because this is her sixth child so she obviously knows what she's doing. On top of this, it turned out the umbilical cord was wrapped around our daughters neck. So as my wife struggled to push the cord would constrict around our babies neck and her heart rate would plummit. This made everything very complicated and stressful. As time went on they prepped the operating room for an emergency C-section and told my wife she only had a couple more tries at natural birth. My wife had an emergency C-section on her first child many years ago so even this solution was dangerous. There was no real easy way forwards but my wife was determined not to have another C-section. something finally gave way and our baby started moving. They used a suction cup on her head to help the process along. Once everything started moving they still had to get the baby out far enough to remove the umbilical cord from her neck. There was a tense couple of pushes and I just remember feeling worried for them both. At last they got the umbilical cord removed and everything went smoothly from there.  It all worked out in the end but the process of the birth was very uncertain and stressful.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,,0.0

This marks the third ceremony that I have attended in the past two years. The first was my oldest son's White Coat, and the second was my wife's ""Pinning"" ceremony for completing nursing school. My family has accomplished a lot in the past two years!! The White Coat Ceremony is somewhat of the induction into the Pharmacy School. I was very happy about this recent event because it meant my son, who at times struggled with school in general, made it in on his first attempt. The struggle was constant for him, but he worked hard and was very persistent through his journey. The whole family attended, my two other sons and my wife, plus grandparents, and uncles and aunts. The Ceremony was short but sweet. I kept thinking the whole time how happy I was that both of my Son's are on the path to a great and successful career. This lead to me thinking back to my journey with my education and career, its a journey that I did not want my sons to go through. I was married with kids at the age of 20, and it seemed like my life story had already been written. I was fortunate to find good work without a degree, and eventually I finished college in 2015. My son's are on a more stable track and I am so grateful to my wife who pushed them along in their journey. I never imagined that as such a young father, that my kids would already accomplish what I could never had dreamed. One day I hope they can experience something like this with their kids.",3WJEQKOXA9OBQAE5RY0I42UD38QA1O,,0.0

It was still decorated for Christmas and just looked like a winter wonderland. The ceremony was quick and straight to the point but there were some really powerful moments. Once the ceremony was over the family took some pictures and then enjoyed cocktail hour. The food was fantastic and then once that was over we danced the night away.

We spent quite a bit of time apart, angry at one another. At least, I was angry at her. I don't know if she was angry at me, because she wrote me a message recently. Actually, she tried to call me a few times and then wrote a message asking me if I was alright. I wrote back and let her know that I'm feeling alright. We talked for quiet a while and she did her best to mitigate any angry feelings we may have between us. We talked about the time that we have been apart and we even touched on the fact that we had disagreed at one point. We didn't talk, at all, about the situation that led to the hurt feelings in the first place. Instead, we talked about what we intend to do going forward. We talked as though we are going forward separately, not together. She was very nice about the whole thing, and didn't say anything nasty. I didn't say anything nasty either. We both just talked as though nothing had ever happened. We talked as though we were no longer friends, but that we now have a history together. We talked like we knew each other very well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but I know that it was some kind of an evolution in our relationship. We now operate as two separate individuals, not nearly as close as before, but with a history that binds us together. Throughout the conversation, I kept trying to find some common ground. I desperately wanted to feel as though I were as close to her as I once was. She didn't reciprocate on that. She made a point to tell me that she still considers me a 'good friend' but never offered any new personal conversation that would support that idea. Instead, she made a point to ask me some very general questions, being careful not to get too personal or specific. She didn't ask anything specific, but I could tell that she cared how I was doing. That made if fell like there is hope that we can still be friends.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GO0ZDUG,,0.0

Im feeling all kinds of emotions I have always been a daddys girl. Even at times when i didn't want to be. My earliest memory of my dad is me dancing in my room while he played the air guitar. I think I was about 4 years old. I remember thinking he was the coolest guy alive. I remember the first time he hit me for no reason i was 10. He was mad at something I cant remember what but he picked me up and threw me into the tv. I really remember feeling pain i just remember my head feeling numb almost like white noise. I cried thinking it had to be my fault I was gonna be better. But I never did get better and things got worse. My father was addicted to drugs I knew that I think it was something everybody knew. I had tried over the years to get him clean. Nothing worked i began to hate him blaming him for everything that happened bad in my life.  I looked at his body in the casket i kissed his cheek he was cold. Almost as cold as our relationship had been while i was growing up. I felt a since of loss for our relationship that could of been I felt guilt for not forgiving him.,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9SV8YB,,0.0

Everyday is a new chance that God had allowed to overcome sins. Its like when you use your finger to reset the game or computer. Making an attempt to beat your last high score. LOL. Thanks be to him for those moments of success. So depending on what  the goal is for that day. We figure out how it could be more efficient or done quicker at times even more sustainable for the ones that care. So I will share one of my moments with you. I am currently on the job of getting more people to keep one of the first loves that God blessed us with. So in this respect I am speaking of the earth and more specifically eliminating our footprint in consumables and waste. I make the example 1st by keeping in mind what and how much I eat. I use two tools the scriptures with my brothers the Israelites and the vegan community. Those give me a sense of accountability and discipline. Even though just the thought of Gods power alone is the greatest and most humbling motivator. I am prone to use the practical things I can see on the daily. And a quick shoutout to the most high for Godspeed which is faster than lightspeed it allows for the word not coming back void. Just being able to see a problem understand a solution then praying with working to solve it is a great miracle and another example of the blessing I cherish from God.,3DY4FPOOA2AJB3GK0N6T6GQ3REHRVT,,0.0

Remembering back to the day of this life changing event, I still remember and feel the sensations of that moment as it happened on that day. Memory has a way of staying vivid when something very powerful sets motion within your senses. Moments like this are never forgotten, as if the event took place recently, even though many years,perhaps decades have faded away. Time may fade away, but when you are responsible for changing the life of someone else for the better. Unlike time, this type of significance never fades away. To this day, I think about that moment when I helped that elderly man in the store, and what may have happened to him had I not been there, as if I was sent there by forces beyond my control to earn my role within humanity. I realize every day, that my life really did change from that moment, this which reflects the overall impact of my existence, and the value of it's meaning. I just hope that someday, when I am in a time of need, that some guardian angel may rescue me from whatever negative aspects which may abound me. If I had not been there in that store on that day, at that time, would this event be someone else's memory to reflect upon, or perhaps the opposite may hold true. These memories could have been dark and painful. For had this man died as a result of nobody there to save his life, this would have been an everlasting tragic event for others close to him. Funerals are hard to forget as well. Unfortunately, that is not the type of memory I want to hold onto. So, in the long run, I feel justified with an enriched focus upon my life focus. I truly feel as though I have earned significant credit toward my worthiness as a human being on this plane of existence.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,,0.0

My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side. That's how I'm dealing with the aftermath of my eviction currently.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,,0.0

I went to the cinema to see a movie and on getting to the cinema i met my longtime friend, it was very pleasing because the last time i saw him was when we graduated high school. I called him by his name he was shocked that who can actually call him by this name, only his closed friends call him by this funny name, he looked and he tried to see who was calling him but he couldn't recognise me well enough because of my new look, beards and all. I went to meet him and i greeted him and after we both saw the movie we went out to talk about life and other things that has happened to us. We spoke about family, jobs, relationships and material possessions. The most amazing thing was that he now drives a Lamborghini aventador. I was so happy for him, he gave me his official card, he said i should email him with my resume. I mailed him with the resume immediately. He made a call and said ""don't worry you'll be paid three times your current wages"". We both laughed about it but he was serious, i saw it in his tone. Jokingly, I asked him when do i start?.he replied and said ""when i'm ready"". I said i'll have to quit my current job. We went to a restaurant not very far from the cinema. We ate and we left. He called me the second day that i've been offered a role in his firm. I was so delighted and happy about the news. I went to the company, he personally gave me a tour of the firm and made me welcomed. I was really surprised but it was overwhelming and i didn't know how what to say, than to say thank you my friend.",3IGI0VL648636LFV643Y24RLVQYON8,,0.0

This home had 4 acres and a 6 car garage which we fell in love with.  After a visit to a bank for a pre approval we have decided to list our home as for sale by owner on zillow make me move to make the offer seem better contingent on sale of our home. The evening of us making an offer on the house we liked they have accepted an offer overbidding the asking price. Being that our home was still on the market on zillow I had a realtor reach out to me to show the house to his client. A few days later a lady came with her realtor and spent about an hour touring the home.  By the end of the tour she deicded to buy the house for full asking price for a cash deal. I was really surprised and thrown off by this especially since there was no other lined up home for us to purchase. I could not say no to an offer that was presented even with circumstances of us not having anywhere to go at the moment. Because the deal was a cash sale there was not much but a home inpection and closing date was chosen 3 weeks from signing the sale agreement. In the span of 3 weeks we found a rental with only a week left to closing. In a manner of 1 day we moved the entire home into a very nice rental while we shop for a new home. The whole course of the three weeks before closing were extremely stressful and chaotic in midst of trying to find a rental that quickly and hoping things would not fall through with inspection or the sale after signing a lease and moving all our belongings.  Overall it was a very unique experience and I could not be happier. We are still searching for the right house btw.,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFI8P9JM,,0.0

During this time I was doing work on my laptop and after hearing my number called I went to the courtroom with the other jurors to see if we were going to be called. After getting dismissed and sent back downstairs, I decided to purchase a muffin. It happened to be a banana nut muffin, unknown to myself. Instead of eating the muffin at the courthouse I waited until i was dismissed completely and on my way home to eat it. Luckily. As I arrived home I decided to eat the muffin, but after taking a few bites I noticed something crunchy. I thought I purchased a banana muffin, and soon after realized it was a banana nut muffin. I happened to be allergic to walnuts and didn't think twice about how bad it would affect me. After trying multiple solutions to get the nut out of my system, it was to no avail and I ended up calling my mom and having her take me to the hospital. My vision was blurry, my throat was closing, and I felt like I was dying and I was so dizzy.

Initially I did not give it much thought and considered it a waste of time. After hearing some stories about how people are actually making impact just by using podcast as a means to share their honest view of various issue and people are actually willing to listen to it. I decided to listen to one, so I had my friend recommend one for me about 2 months ago, and he did. I tuned in after getting home from work, at first I did not get the idea but once I paid attention I realized what every was saying. I became a regular listeners of that podcast. A month later I was laid off at my job, I guess due to restructuring. I had nothing to do I was just at home all day everyday sleeping and eating, and maybe go out with my friends once in a while. At one of those outings I met the voice behind my favorite podcast and he told me how he got started. I decided to give it a shot, and then I did some research for about a week. I had no reason not to, no job, just bills to pay. 2 weeks ago I went live, I only had a few listeners, with few regular downloads at first. About 5 downloads to be precise and they were all my friends I suspected. One day I was just frustrated and I started ranting about my former job. This rant attracted people, I was amazed. Though I never the name of the company Where I worked but I said some things to me day to day and people seemed to like stories. I just kept on telling them different story everyday and now I am very successful as I have over 5,000 downloads every week.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO,0.0

They would have to regulate her medications, and she was fine. This time was different. She had to have open heart surgery. My family and I went through a lot of ups and downs. One day they would tell us that she's making great progress on her recovery, the next, they'd say she's regressing. This went on for a month, before they finally told us there was nothing they could do for her. She and I had our fair share of issues, but we both loved each other very much. She was the only person I could say who truly loved me. Now she's gone, and I've been staying at a friend's house, trying to decide what to do next. I've suffered with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidal thoughts for decades. I honestly don't know if I want to continue. My mom was the only reason I kept going.

I was finally able to marry the girl of my dreams, something that for a long time I didn't know was possible. We haven't officially gotten married yet, but being engaged allowed to take things to the next level. We bought a house that was simply beautiful and was pretty similar to what I wanted to have growing up. It was hard to believe that things were falling into place for me. While the house was great and the person I got to spend my life with was greater, something was still missing. We weren't really about kids, but we wanted to care for something. I had wanted a dog for a long time, and she was a dog lover herself. The breed was debated here and there, but we ultimately settled on a Maltese puppy. I believe we made the right decision. The pup has taken well to the household and we think that was what was needed to complete the home. I honestly just look forward to my future unfold before me.

I couldn't stop talking about my son to everyone I know. Even my friends got bored of listening to talk about him all the time, the joy of fatherhood was just overwhelming. After about two years, my wife and I were advised by some friends to start potty training. We didn't have any idea on what to do, as he was our was first child. We decided to talk my parents to get some tips on how to go about. Once we were about to start potty training him, we made a time-table, which mostly based on when at first it was fun.  We thought everything was going great, we were having fun introducing the potty to him and demonstrating when he is supposed to use the potty. After the first week there was no improvement, we still were highly motivated to keep going, as were still had other methods and processes to try. After two more weeks it became clear that he was not improving in anyway, no matter the process we tried, even when we tried rewarding him he still did not improve. My wife and I then decided to go online for some updated information about potty training, because at that point we were already frustrated. We found some information which we applied. After the application and there was some slight improvement, but it was far from the main goal. We finally caved after about two months and we had to higher a professional. Hiring the professional was not cheap, but we had to make the sacrifice, also we were already emotionally exhausted.

I had earlier suggested we go on a trip to Hawaii. My husband did not take long before he agreed that the idea is clever. I have always watched the Hawaiian beaches on TV and the good apartment and condos with beach view. I have always wanted to visit Hawaii. The week we were to travel, I went shopping. I selected vintage wear for my boy and my husband. I bought him a silky boxers and some vintage shirts for the beaches. I bought my son a nice cowboy hat to match his wears. Believe me when I say I was very excited about the idea of visiting Hawaii. The trip was a bit rough but the excitement of landing in Hawaii just filled my head that I didn't have time to think about the flight itself. We landed and rented a car at the airport to drive to our booked airbnb condo. It was just facing the beach (dream come true). The moment we reached, I just opened my box and started removing the dress for a beach wear. He was quite amused by my actions. I waited some more minutes for them to do their thing. He knew that time was not the time to ask to rest or sleep as I will completely disagree. We hit the beach after a 6-hour flight. Crazy!!! The water was cold but we had a nice time dodging the waves and playing the the beach sand. We spent 10 days in Hawaii before leaving for our state.",,3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5B42UPQ,0.0

He also called me a slut, and let me tell you, that kind of stuff runs through a middle-school quick! It really hurt my feelings.  My good friends stood by me, but people that didn't know me leered at me in the halls. I just rushed to my classes as quick as possible. I was embarrassed to go to school for two whole weeks.

This was my second child but the first time I carried a boy. His birth was so memorable to me because up until that point, I was sort of disconnected from my pregnancy, as I was going it alone as a single mom. I remember arriving to the hospital that morning. I met with my midwife and she sat down with my daughter in the waiting room as I went in for my surgery. My doula met me in the post-op room, and we spent awhile there talking with the surgeon about what I could expect. As they brought me into the room, I remember the brightness and 'holiness', if you will, of the operation room. I sat down on the cold table and the anesthesiologist came to prep me for my spinal. That was the moment I lost it and began to cry. Not because it hurt, but because I was about to meet my son. It felt surreal. I was given the spinal and immediately laid back on the table so the medicines could kick in. They draped a curtain over my stomach and I began practicing my breathing techniques I had learned for the home birth I had originally planned to have. My son was breech up until 41 weeks, and although I did everything I could to get him to turn, he remained the 'wrong' way and I ended up scheduling my c-section. I felt so calm. The complete opposite of how I had expected to feel as I lay there, about to be cut open. The smell of burning flesh hit me. I felt a bit of tugging as I deeply breathed in and slowly out. I looked at my doula and asked her if they had started it yet. She smiled at me and said ""He's almost here."" A minute later I heard a loud cry, and I broke out of my trance and began to cry myself.

We had been talking about it, but he gave me no indication he was ready to pop the question. We have been dating for about 1 year and things were going great. We like the same things, we have learned to agree to disagree. We had asked me about the kind of ring I would like to have if we were to get engaged and I told him, I actually showed him, lol! He didn't expect that. When he asked me that question, I thought, ok , this is it! He must be getting ready to ask me on Valentine's Day. I already knew what my answer would be, but I was wondering how would he do it. So, Valentine's Day comes and goes and still no proposal. We did go out to dinner, so I was starting to wonder what was going on. I knew he was going to ask me, but at this point, I didn't know when or how. So, I waited and waited. Every now and again I would throw out little hints. I made sure to send him a picture of the ring, so he would always have it.  Finally, it happened. One day while we were driving through the city going to a new restaurant that opened on the wharf. We get there and we're both looking out at the water and he drops down on one knee and POPs the question. I said YES, before he ever put the ring on my finger!  Now, I'm actually glad he didn't do it on Valentine's Day, because now we have our own special day!",,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99SYCI7F,0.0

When I originally enlisted at the age of 18, I only planned on serving for 4 years. I planned on earning the money for college, saving up my money for life expenses, and gaining some training that would aid in better employment. Instead I found myself going career. A big factor was the conflicts overseas. What people do not understand is that your co-workers are more than just your co-workers or friends but family. You serve together for several years your family aid one another. You go through the thick and think, the good and bad together. In Iraq I witnessed many of my family members wounded or killed. How could I turn tail and leave the service after all that I had seen and been apart of? This is why my retirement was so hard to accept because I still feel as if I can give but I know it is time to move on. At my retirement my unit presented me several awards. I received multiple handshakes and hugs goodbye. It was my family coming out to say goodbye to me since I may never see most of them again in my life. It is a scary moment as I am now faced with the question of what to do with my life after spending over 20 years being told what to do and when to do it. I've never cried at work but a former patient of mine that I treated through 40 surgeries traveled 1300 miles just to appear at my retirement and say goodbye. That is how close your co-workers become. They're family.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMWFR6TE,0.0

My priorities in life have changed and I have spent many nights thinking about my relationship with my own parents and family. I want to change so many things and be the best I can be for my son. My family ties haven't been strong since I became an adult and my son has made me realize it's time to change that because before I know it my parents will be gone and he will be a grown man with his own children. I want to be the kind of parent that instills family values. I want him to know and be close with his grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and all extended family. I want to be the kind of parent he comes home to see every thanksgiving and Christmas. I want him to know I tried and became the best person I could be all for him. I'm working on it and I won't stop! I'm enjoying every moment and trying to live in that moment. He's crawling and babbling and eating real food and I'm basking in it as long as possible as I know it won't last forever.

However, the events leading up to the ceremony were pretty stressful. To start, the weather was lousy. We were having an outdoor wedding. It looked like it was going to rain, and it was already very windy. We were worried that some of the setup might just blow over from the wind. Also, we hit a lot of traffic going over to the venue, and I was already very stressed. My wedding dress also felt like it was not fitting right, even though it fit perfectly when I tried it on numerous times before. However, this could have been in my head, as I was already very stressed about the wedding and everything that was going on. It's not like I did not love my soon to be husband. Nor did I have second thoughts about it. On the contrary, I love him very much, and I was just looking forward to getting the ceremony started. When I finally walked down the aisle with my father and I saw my husband to be, I felt way better. Seeing him standing up there just seemed to alleviate all the stress. With that being said, the most surprising thing that happened was when the ring bearer tripped and fell. He quickly got up though, and he acted like nothing happened. It ended up not raining, and the wedding was relatively calm after that.",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCX8WQ0,0.0

When our first child came along, I was pretty apprehensive about being a father, since I had deliberately put off marriage and having kids for so long. What surprised me was how good being a Dad felt. My Mom had always told me, ""Its different when they're your own kids"" and damn if it wasn't true. All this ran through my mind as we drove back from dropping off my oldest son at college today. In retrospect, it all seemed to go by so fast, like things fast-forwarded from him being born until today. He is just a couple steps away from being out on his own as an adult. It was emotional experience for all of us, even our younger son, who had seemed almost happy to be the only kid in the house. Now he seems a little upset, just like my wife and I. Part of it is the knowledge that we're getting older. Retirement is just around the corner, part of the downside of starting a family late. I also worry about how our younger son feels about having parents in their 50s as a young teenager. Some of his friend's parents are a good 10 years younger than us. But we are both in good health and pretty active, so we should be around to see our youngest off to college in a few more years. Hopefully those years will go by a little slower, but I doubt it. Time does seem to go by faster and faster as you get older, another one of my parents sayings that has proven true.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLKSHM83,0.0

It was a Sandals resort and everything was included such as drinks, food, and sleeping arrangements. We went for her birthday because she had never been out of the country and always wanted to. On the first day, we decided to just relax a bit and drink on the beach. It was a lot of fun because we could just talk together. I have never been able to spend that much alone time with my wife because we are constantly hanging out with our children. It was very nice to be able to get away. As the vacation went on we decided we wanted to do some sort of physical activity. We did a high ropes course right off the beach that made me a bit nervous, but that my wife loved it. I don't like heights that much and many objects were swinging at a high height. I was able to jump from space to space, but often would fall and dangle from the top. We also decided to go on a quick cruise that took us out at sunset to watch some dolphins swimming in the ocean. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and we didn't see many dolphins, but the company from being next to my wife was the best. Almost every night we would go dancing too. There was a bar that had a huge dance floor and lots of people would come out and we would all just dance together and chill. It was great to be with my wife, but also be surrounded by other people. We didn't want this vacation to end, but eventually we had to leave and return to our kids so we had to. I wouldn't trade this trip for the world.",,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM275AGIJ,0.0

His passing was tragic, but in all the time that has passed I don't feel as though I've really come to terms with losing him. So I had been thinking of a way that I could finish the grieving process and come to terms with everything. Then, I thought about something that he always talked about. He used to say that when he finally retired he would put away his work suit and put on his gardening rags. I always rolled my eyes, thinking if he really wanted to garden he'd make time for it in the present. But every time our family tour the nearby Botanical Gardens  I would see the longing on his face. The contentment he seemed to have when he'd bring home a plant he picked out, brought home and nurtured, then gave to a friend. Even though he's gone now, I want to feel closer to him. I want to fulfill his dream of gardening for happiness and pleasure. So from now on, until I can no longer, I will be spend every weekend tending to my father's dream garden. I'll find all his favorite plants. I'll even pull out all of his old landscape designs. I'll figure out a way to incorporate his ideas into my own land. I think this is the best way to honor his memory.",,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJESBAGP,0.0

The girl I met there, Julie, called today and asked how I was. I'm not exactly sure how to take it though given that she hadn't called before now. It's been ages since I got along with someone so well, and everything we had in common made night one for the ages, plus there was a wedding happening! I can't believe Jake managed to get Vulfpeck to play his wedding. That's Jake's style though, all class, and an absolute jazz fanatic. I can't believe how much they must have paid for that shindig between the band, and that incredibe spread from Chez Gus. That guy is a big time chef, I didn't even think he did catering, but Jake can be a persuasive mofo. I guess the Franklins can be too haha. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had such a completely satisfying experience. That sounds underwhelming, but it cover all the bases and that's the best way to describe it. All 5 senses were satiated, the conversation was inteligent yet casual, and Julie sure made the overnight memorable. I think I will try and stay in touch with her, at the least. Who knows, maybe her and I can recreate that night someday, only swap ourselves in as the happy couple. Or maybe we can just hang and bang.

My wife and I drove down to visit her sister and her sister's husband since we hadn't seen their new house yet. We went down for the 4th of July, partied, talked, and had a great time. The most memorable night was the evening of the 4th of July. It started to rain hard in the afternoon and we had to cancel going to an event we were going to go to to see fireworks. However, this turned out to be great. We got to drink, party, and have a bunch of fun together at home visiting. I'm glad this happened because it allowed us to spend more time with each other. Events visiting family like this are my favorite because I just love connecting and spending time with people. It brings me a lot of joy to visit with family. Plus, once you have a little bit of drink in you it allows you to open up and talk more. I think we had a great time connecting and bonding with each other. I wouldn't trade it for the world.

The birth of my own children was monumental and shaped my life for the next almost 30 years. As my life went on, so did my comfort with who I was and how things were. After so many years, I knew that there was nothing that was going to change my views on life and me as a person. I was wrong. My daughter, Sarah, recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. This is our first grandchild. Let me tell you, there is nothing in this world that can prepare you for being a grandparent. It is an experience all to itself. The day started like any other, until I got the call. Sarah called to tell me that she was in labor and heading to the local hospital, and she wanted me there. I have never gotten dressed and out the door so fast in all my life. When I arrived at the hospital I found my baby, Sarah, smiling and excited to meet her son. On the way to the hospital I had images in my head of a girl who needed her mom to help her though this painful ordeal but there she was all smiles. As the day, and her labor, progress Sarah was her usual chatty, funny self. Momentary pauses during her contractions were but a semi-colon in her stories. It was hard to believe when the doctor said she was ready to push, Sarah had barely winced from what I know to be tremeandous pain. It seemed to happen in the blink of an eye. Sarah was calm and focused as she brought her son, my grandson, into this world. In that moment of birth I was not longer Mom, I became Grandma. Never did I think I could love any child more than my own, but I was wrong. Sarah was no longer my baby, she was a battle proven mother who I admired more than anyone. Though I was always careful not to spoil my own children, I found a yearning to give this little boy everything his heart desired. I had a new mission in life, to dote over and spoil my new grandson.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA48V36RC,0.0

Pictured Rocks is a beautiful location. The sights are amazing. From starting in the woods, to crisscrossing rivers, to spotting waterfalls, all the way to the Pictured Rocks themselves. The titular Pictured rocks are sheer cliffs on the shore of Lake Superior. They have great coloring that gives them their name. Gazing over them is a memorable experience. Looking hundreds of feet down into the clear and turquoise waters is stunning. Lake Superior is always a sight to behold, but here is where she shines best. I really do love it there. The hike itself is fairly easy even despite a bump or two. Though, it was a bit muddy being spring. There were moments of tiptoeing and leaping around mucky mud. But it just added to the adventure. Rain was a possibility throughout the morning but it held off and the temperatures were cool and perfect. Just an all around great experience that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend the area.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV,,0.0

She stopped to stay with us during her journey. In the past I had not always felt close to her. She is a very exacting, highly intelligent and headstrong woman. I admire her for that but it can be challenging as she can be curt. Over time I have felt a shift and in this visit, I felt that shift very strongly. She was softer, kinder and more vulnerable. She looked frail, thin. She was more patient and loving and was accepting of my recent unorthodox career choices. I felt myself opening up to her more and feeling at ease in saying what I wanted to. I saw that she received it as it was, without judgment. When we said goodbye to her early in the morning, she looked at both my husband and I very pointedly. I felt that this moment was significant. I felt that we all understood that her life hung in the balance. We all knew that we did not know or have any control, beyond the limits of modern medicine. I felt that I understood something about mortality through her, that we all are hanging in the balance and vulnerable at any given moment to death. As she waved goodbye I felt an overwhelming love for her and both an enormous appreciation for life while understanding my incredible impotence in the face of death.",3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1X9KOJ,,0.0

They were quickly drawn to the giant salt water tank in the center of the building. Giant coral in the middle of it with fish swimming in circles. We spent the next few hours walking up the along side it taking it all in. They loved seeing the turtles inside that were 150 years old.

We celebrated at a very nice restaurant located in the Arts District of Downtown LA that my Dad had never been to. Upon finishing our meal he remarked that he had grown up within walking distance of the restaurant. Considering we had time to kill before the movie we had planned to see later, Dad decided to show us the house where he spent several of his formative years. My dad is a natural storyteller and he's immensely proud of his hometown so it was an extra gift in itself to see and hear him gesticulate and intone about stories from his childhood and which friends used to live where and what kind of misadventures he got himself into as a young boy. Our kids were very taken by some of the mischief my dad would get into, like shining the shoes of local gangsters, or ducking away from the school bullies by running across he rooftops and sometimes jumping from roof to roof over great heights to escape a beating. They laughed at his comedic embellishments, and they were more than a little incredulous at his fierce independence and feisty spirit, considering Dad was telling them how he was basically given free reign as a five year old to explore his surroundings by himself. He told us several intimate personal details like how strained his relationship was with his stern and often emotionally cold father and how he would find solace and understanding in the warmth of his mom. He also mentioned details about the day she died when Dad was only sixteen, which he very rarely does. This cross generational sharing is very important to my wife and I. It gives our kids perspectives into their own lives and a sense of history as to where they come. It also gives them insight into their own emotional makeup and personal perspectives. Our kids have a strong moral center, and a ""can do"" attitude when it comes to fixing their own problems. I think it's very valuable for them to know that the are values that we have tried very hard to instill in them in order to make them strong and productive members of society working for the public good. When you're young you think that birthdays are all about the cake, the presents, and the celebration of yourself, and in many ways those aspects are very important to my family. But as I get older I find that the only thing I really want is to be secure in the knowledge that my family knows how tight and lasting our connections are to each other and how our common bonds come from a place of great emotional depth. We had a lovely rest of the day and I was showered with generosity throughout but the greatest gift was experiencing the richness of our family identity.",3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOQL2G,,0.0

I was amazed at what the classes and the environment had done for him. His body transformed from that of a soft, pudgy video game fanatic into the lean body of a junior Tarzan. He also came out of his shell. He is a shy, socially awkward boy and the extremely positive and supportive atmosphere helped him to be more confident in himself and more comfortable with other people. It really made me feel like I wanted to be a part of this big ""family"", so I signed up. I was still very worried that my age and the extra pounds I was carrying would be embarrassing at least and insurmountable at worst. In my very first class I met a student who was older than my mother and another who weighed over 300 pounds. They both assured me that it was fun and very doable for people of all ages and sizes. I also was treated in a very supportive and encouraging manner by everyone, regardless of their age or level of ability. I think the most surprising thing was that I apparently move really well for a 50 year old. I was really proud of myself when I realized that I could keep up with the youngsters. I'm not as fast and flexible as they are, of course, but I can make up for it with my strength and my focus on proper technique. That first class was such a positive and uplifting experience that I immediately signed up for a year of classes. I also signed up for weapons and sparring classes. My son is still doing great and is only 2 belts away from his black belt now!",3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEE5LTD9,,0.0

It was a normal day, I had let him out side like I do every morning and he was out for about fifteen minutes. I left the door open for him so when he was ready he could come back in on his own. I went into my office and started to prep for my workday. I heard him bumping into the doggie gate in the hallway. After about four times of this, I opened the office door to check on him. I quickly noticed that something was wrong with his eyes and that he could not see. My heart sank. I was home alone with him and didnt know what to do. I immediately started to panic. I called my husband at work and asked him to come home. It took about an hour but we got him to the vet. I was sure it was going to be a major problem and I would not be able to afford to care for him properly. However, the vet knew immediately what was wrong.  He told me Buddy was only having an allergic reaction to flea bites. It was a simple fix, he was given flea medication and in a few days his condition cleared up.",3KB8R4ZV1FTDDZ90FVLH60IPKWFGB5,,0.0

It was a really good time, everyone was having a lot of fun. The next Saturday we woke up and went to brunch before hitting the beach again. Once again, it was a memorable time and we all had a lot of fun. We went body surfing in the water when all of a sudden we saw a shark fin. Another swimmer appeared to have gotten bit, this was completely crazy. I swam as fast as I could to help the other swimmer, and when I arrived he seemed ok. But he couldn’t swim, and so I helped him to get back to the shore. It was a struggle to help him. When I got back to the shore I looked around for the lifeguard but couldn’t find him. So I wrapped up the shark bite wounds with my towel and drove this guy to the hospital. The hospital said he would be ok and only needed some stitches. I waited for the guy to get the medical treatment that he needed. It didn’t take that long and he eventually got the treatment. Later that day he thanked me and invited me and my friends to a party.

I woke up as normal and prepared everything in the house as normal and waited for the rest of the family to wake up.

Luckily this year I managed to catch some peak color, and even the trees that weren't at peak color yet were only a day or two from perfection. I made the decision to travel the back roads, and found a beautiful field, and while driving around trying to find a cell signal I found a beautiful lake. The trees across from it made for a stunning picture. I even stopped at a secluded town and took a stroll. I got breakfast at the local market; some fresh baked donuts and apple cider! Eventually I made my way to a local ski resort, which was holding its annual Columbus Day weekend events. The main event was a gondola ride to the top of the mountain to catch the panoramic view of autumn trees as far as the eye could see! The view from the actual top was slightly hazy, but the view from the gondola ride was picturesque! That was the highlight of my trip, as by the time I got down from the mountain the sky was clouding up, preparing for rain. I stopped at a local country store and a local farmer's market. I bought trinkets, fresh fudge apples and pumpkins. By the time I really started to head home it started to rain out, but I didn't mind.

We were so excited for our son to have a sibling. However, when we told our son the news he was not happy about it. We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real for our son knowing he would have a little sister. Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it. We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on. But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face. He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days. Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was. Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much. He is super protective over her and it's a huge relief that they like each other now.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0,0.0

You hear of some fantastic revelation some day up on the mountain, or a close encounter with nature, even a brush with some insane disaster, bringing the person onto the doorstep of death. Most people quote extraordinary event that is very unique to them and hear about how that something have come to have a great impact on their lives, changing the very manner in which they view life and perceive it. You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQQBUYZ,0.0

I was going through many things such as my mother being in a comatose state, me losing my job, and falling in love with someone who didn't deserve me.  During this time I fell back deeply in love with something other than myself or another person. I felt back on something that was dependable and reliant. I fell back on drugs. I knew that it would happen to someone, but never that it would happen to me. I couldn't bring my self to believe that I would someday need Naloxone to be revived from the point of death twice. The effects of the drugs started to happen around 7:00 pm est when I started to go into a heavy sleep. My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up  and start CPR on myself until the ambulance arrived. I took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. I ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. I was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital.

Veronica and I had dated since high school. I thought she was the woman I was going to marry. 4 months ago, totally out of the blue, she broke up with me. I was devastated. We did everything together. Not only was she my girl friend, but she was my best friend. I thought we had the perfect relationship. We liked the same things, we had the same friends, we could even finish each others sentences. When she broke up with me, I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After the break up, I stayed in and didn't talk to anybody. I didn't want to go anywhere, or do anything. I fell in to a really deep depression. My mom finally convinced me to go see a therapist. Little did I know, that therapist would change my life. She made me realize how much I had to offer and that the break up was not because of me. I didn't see it at the time, but Veronica and I were just comfortable with one another, we were not soul mates. We had just been holding on to something because we were afraid to move on. I'm finished with my therapy and I feel better about myself than I have in a long time. As a matter of a fact, I'm going on a date next week and I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time.

Two weeks ago, we started arguing about why I never want to be around her friends. I find them annoying, so I told her that. I think its pretty common for the boyfriend to not what to hang out with his girlfriend and her friends. She took it as a bit of an insult, though. She said insulting who she likes is an insult to her character. The whole thing was blown out of proportion. She tried to trap me with stupid questions like ""so if I get along with annoying people, you find me annoying?"" and things like that. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this was going to be a bad argument. I didn't realize just how bad until later in the night, though. We were supposed to go to dinner at my parent's house, but she said she wasn't coming. She loves my parents, and my mom's cooking, so that was a sign of just how mad she was. Still, though, it was such a stupid argument, so I didn't apologize. I went to dinner and then came back. She wasn't there. She decided to stay at her friend's house. I was shocked that she was so offended at this. We didn't talk for 2 days. We sort of made up after that, but its never really been the same.

Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, ""unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program."" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AQ2YLJV,0.0

It was probably the most difficult question for me to ask him in the 18 years we have been married.  After much soul searching, I just couldn't be in this relationship anymore.  So we asked his mom to take our children for the evening and sat down.  I explained my side to him, about how we just didn't seem in sync anymore.  You see, we had tried therapy in the past, and we both attempted to compromise in the beginning, but would go back to our old habits after just a week or two.  My husband's interests have deviated from mine.  We didn't seem to have anything in common anymore.  I would try to talk to him about my day, what I wanted to do in the future, and I grew to realize he just wasn't listening.  That's when I had to dig deep and admit that I wasn't listening to him either.  I spent many nights awake, sad about my relationship and he just didn't seem to notice.  So when we talked that night, he agreed with me.  We worked out a plan on how to separate, how to tell the kids, and go about our lives.

It started a few months before that, when he complained about how much his chest hurt when he would exercise. I just chalked it up to him getting older, and joked with him that that's what happens when you're an old man, trying to run with the young boys. I remember the 1st time I noticed it, it was 7 months ago. He had just come back from playing basketball. I laid on his chest and could feel his heart beating insanely quick; I'm talking about it sounding like a ""drum roll please"" quick beat. I brought it to his attention but he just brushed it off as having a harder game today than usual. Things started going downhill quickly after that. 2 weeks later, he could barely walk up the stairs without being out of breath. I told him he needs to go to the hospital, the ER or something so they can at least listen to his heart with a stethoscope. He still refused, tried to pretend like nothing was out of the ordinary. Then, one day, he was so out of breath coming up the stairs, he passed out and ended up spraining his wrist. Thankfully he finally went to the hospital, and they examined his heart. Laying in the hospital bed, his breath suddenly became super heavy and labored, and one of the machines started making this really loud beeping noise. Doctors came rushing in, they ended up having to usher me out; they had to a CT scan/MRI on him. They found that he had 3 damaged heart valves, and because of that, his heart wasn't able to get enough of his oxygen in his blood to his lungs and every subsequent problem. He had to have emergency heart surgery. Recovery was expected to take 6 months, with very light exercise after 3 months. Only 2 more months left until he's fully recovered. Always listen to your body, it knows you best.",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,0.0

I had never been to a restaurant where I had to make a reservation before. The food was great. We got to have many different dishes that I hadn't had before.  I had a blueberry martini which is my favorite and the waiter brought me a creme brule with a candle in it. My boyfriend quietly sang me happy birthday in my ear and then we left. We then went and saw a live band at a bar that we go to quite often. They were really great.

The restaurant bar was pretty busy and noisy, but we couldn't help noticing a really cute group of guys sitting at the next table.  After about a half hour one of them came over to ask if we wanted to join them for drinks.  We did.  I found myself seated next to this really cute guy a bit older than me with dark brown hair.   We started talking and it turned out that we had some friends in common.  We also lived in the same neigbourhood.  He seemed really friendly and had a great sense of humour, which is a real plus for me.  After a couple of hours of chatting it was time to leave.  I had my car with me and my friends all seemed to have paired off with the other guys at the table.  I decided to offer this guy a lift home even though it was a bit out of character for me.  He quickly agreed and we walked to my car chatting along the way.  When we were about two blocks from his apartment he turned off the car radio and said he had to ask me something.  I thought that he was going to ask me out.  Instead, he told me that he lived with his girlfriend and that they had been together since high school.  He said that things were good between them, but that he was looking for ""a bit more"".  He asked me if I would consider being his girlfriend ""on the side.""  I asked him exactly what that meant.  He gave me a cocky smile and said ""you know.""  I told him that was not my style and pulled up in front of his building.  He told me that he was sorry to hear that I felt that way and had thought we hit it off.  I didn't answer him and he got out of the car.

I found out by chance. What was making it even worse was that it wasn't the first time he was cheating on my mother. Also, the woman he was involved with was in her early twenties, so she was younger that my little sister. I felt horrible and truly disgusted with him. I didn't know what to do. I decided to speak with my sister about it and it turned out that she was suspecting him for a couple of months.  After talking for hours we decided against telling our mother, because her mental state has been very fragile for the last couple of years. We decided that we would confront our father though. When we did he denied it and lied to our faces over and over again. He claimed that the woman was just a good friend of his and was helping him with a new business venture. He even got frustrated that we don't believe him. Both my sister and I are a 100% certain that he was lying and that he was cheating on my mom. I am not sure if after we confronted him he had put an end to the affair or it is still a thing. Honestly, I think that it would be much better if my mother had divorced him the first time she caught him cheating, while we were still kids. She could've been so much happier without him.",,3PPTZCWALR608M6UO56WMWTUTZ9ZQQ,0.0

I was drawing a huge blank! I didn't really have it in me to write a long tale about anything, but I also didn't feel inspired to write a short story. I thought about writing in the fashion of Bukowski, but I recalled how our professor stated to never write like someone else. We were to write how we'd want to be heard. When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming. At the end of the class, we all turned into the professor our work. The next day, I was called to the front to read my story and was used as an example of how to write in the style of someone and not copying them. I was flattered that my work was recognized! It was even more flattering when I knew that  my paper was probably just a disjointing thought process written to paper.",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943671CYU1T,0.0

We didn't get to take a summer vacation, so we decided to make this one extra special.  My kids really wanted to see a cave.  So, I did some research and looked in to caves that were near us.  My search took me to Mammoth Cave National Park.  I booked a hotel and got tickets to the cave that day.  The whole family was extremely excited to go!  While we were on vacation there, the kids could not stop talking about how happy they would be going inside a cave.  It got me excited seeing things through their eyes.  When we got in the cave, they were a little freaked out at first, but got used to it.  They were amazed that we were actually underground!  They learned so much about caves and how things look underground.  We had a great tour guide who told us all about the history of the cave.  It was very interesting for the adults as well.  Being inside a cave is a weird experience, but we all had so much fun.  We would highly recommend to go to a cave for a vacation.  Especially if you have kids, they will be over the moon!",,3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLQAQ8A1,0.0

What I find memorable is when I went down to Sea World for a recent trip. The trip was well over due and was infact a weekend vacation. I drove down from my town in Central California but first I needed to buy a GPS. I found one on sale online for about 100 bucks, a Garmin type. I proceeded to wait for it and update and install it in my vehicle. My vehicle also needed some maintenance like an oil change and tire check up. I was ready to roll, it was at this moment I realized I could've probably used my cell phone with google maps to direct me but you can't be certain because it doesn't work without cellular data on continually. I went to the local dollar store and stocked up on snacks and drinks; the usual water, gummies, some twix, and some chips. I then loaded up my playlist which is a mix of various genres and hit the free way. The driving was so soothing and chill, the California weather was spectacular. I was well on my way; 3 hours later I stopped in a Subway for some lunch. I then continued on my journey. I stopped again later for some gas; bathroom; and restock on snacks. Later that evening I finally reached San Diego but it was very late; I needed a place to rest because the events would be happening the following day on Saturday. I went to my brothers house and crashed with him; he didn't know I was coming because I wanted to surprised him. I ended up meeting him and he decided to go with me to Sea World so he could show me around the place, its huge. I ended up having something take alot of pictures for me while I posed by the different animals. The place was very stunning; my favorite part was the Killer Whale exhibit where you go watch them do tricks with their trainers. I wouldn't feel comfortable being so close to something with the world ""killer"" in its name, seems dangerous but the trainers weren't harmed. I ended up grabbing lunch later with my brother at some Mexican taco shop in Sea World that had massive burritos that put Chipotle to shame. It seemed like time flew and it was already evening. That was my recent trip; I won't bore you with the details about returning.",,3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJUTHB15,0.0

I must it was hard getting to know her since she was an indoors kind of person. On that day I saw her as beautiful as the first day I saw her. The church was packed with the most closest friend in my life and my family members. The joy in my heart was so thrilling I was blushing a lot. The night before me and my male friends had a bachelors party that was so interestingly we over drunk. So on that day my hungover was so intense I felt like sleeping.  That day she walked to the front of the church with such a glowing smile I was proud I had her. As I took her head scuff of she smelled the stench of alcohol in my mouth she made a joke about it we giggled a bit before making our vows. The after party was the best and the memory will linger in my mind for the rest of my life. I will cherish that day, for the rest of my life. Since she reminds me how good that day was everyday.

I tried to point out to her some of the ways we could donate a portion of it away and why, and she was trying to explain her reasoning as well. We had been have marital problems for awhile but i knew in that moment sitting at the table i had to make a decision about our future, i knew she was not happy and neither was I. So i tried to calmly gather my feelings and courage to tell her that it was not working and we needed to separate. I knew it was going to be hard and heartbreaking but i also knew in the future it would be what was best for her and me. I had packed up my bag for the night and said goodbye to my son, as i drove to my friends house it was one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in my life, i was trying to keep it together and try not to turn around and go back. one of the hardest part for me to accept also was not being able to see my son for awhile. he is very young and i knew he would not understand what was happening or why. A few days later her parents came to our home to pack up some of her stuff to take with. I remember them asking what the plan was moving forward and me trying to explain to them what my plan was that i knew of so far but that i did not have all the answers. I remember i took my son for a few days while they packed up and left behind what she didn't want. we only lived in a apartment so there wasn't a whole lot of possessions to take. After she had finished packing and left with our son, I walked into our apartment knowing that life would never be the same again, that I would have to sacrifice time spent with my son but knowing that if i could just hold onto what would be better in the future for everyone that thats what i should do. It would be better for him to grow up with both of us happy instead of us staying together and being miserable just for the sake of appearances. It was a difficult decision but the right one.",,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862MOF9SH,0.0

It was very scary and exciting all at the same time. I knew I would have a transplant for a long time, as the kidney disease I had was the result of Lupus. When my kidney failure reached end-stage, I went into treatment that kept my kidney function at a certain level. It was a level that was low enough to allow you to be considered for a transplant, but not emergency-level yet. Doctors said if I could stay at that level of function, I could still live many years without needing a transplant or dialysis. After a couple of years, I started getting kidney stones and sometimes they needed surgery. They started to harm what was left of my kidney function, so I got my transplant.  The day of the transplant, I went with my husband. We had to be at the hospital very early and we left the house at 4 am. We aren't morning people and we were both nervous but there wasn't anything to really say. So we sat in relative silence for a while in the hospital room. It was about 3 hours util I went into the surgery theater. As they were wheeling me in, I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen after all the time I spent learning and worrying about it. I was very scared but I had to meet so many people and answer so many questions that it kept my mind occupied. I remember shaking with nerves while I talked to the anesthesiologist. That was the most scared I got, but it was the last thing before they started giving me medication. I don't really remember much after our conversation, until I woke up in recovery. I asked for my husband right away and I was so releived and happy. He was right there waiting so from then on he was by my side.  Once I got into my room, he stayed with me until it was late at night. After that first day I could only see him every afternoon because we lived two hours away from the hospital and he also had to keep working. I was so happy to go home after 10 days.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T,0.0

I was really fear and getting very worry about my son.  Sometimes my son did not do any thing without the help of myself.    Nowadays it was really very hard thing to manage my son activities in home.  My wife works at home.  But she also do not know about how to tackle or manage my toddle son's non stopped activity.  Three months ago my toddler son broke his arm while I was not around on him.  My also doing some work in the house.  So she did not know how to make the first aid kid.  So she suddenly make a call for me and telling about the incident. I was really getting very sad about the incident of my small child  Because I love my son very much than everything in this world  So, that I am not able to tolerate this incident.   I was totally blanked and think of my child's pain while going to the home.  My colleagues are very support and make myself calm and help me taking my child in the hospital   After the injury of my child I often took permission or leave.  But the manager of my office may understand my situation.  because he is also a father of his child. And also I spent more time for my toddle kid making himself very enthusiastic and enjoyable.Nowadays I was really very like to spent more time between my son and also my wife.  Which decision made myself very happy and energetic to do my works properly in my office and also in my house so I just giving the best advice to all married couples is being very good to your child and family which makes you very happy and made your life fulfillment.  Nowadays my life is very beautiful only because of my lovable family. Unexpected event that changed my Life Sometimes things happen in the lives of people that they have no control over. When these things happen I call them life experience, and they often leave people muttering the words Why me From time to time, actions of others affect my own. Other times, an act of irresponsibility and immaturity on people’s part could cause life changing events on our loved ones and on us. From bad events, I have learned.  If you want to be happy you should spent more time with family members. always do more things for you family makes you happy and feel proud to yourself.  Families are an integral part of one’s life it does not matter if you have a small or big family as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H4CNTZG,0.0

I was so nervous but the vet was calm so I tried to be as well.  They gave me several meds for him.  The vet did not know what caused the episode so that has me worried.  It could happen again if I do not change whatever caused it in the first place.  I felt unsettled because I did not know if it was something he ate or if he was allergic to something.  What if the next time it is even worse?  I did not know where to even start to try and find out the cause.  I decided to take him back to the vet in a couple of days for a recheck and to talk to the vet in depth about steps I can take to make sure he stays well.

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session.

Shes an old girlfriend from highschool. Haven't spoken with her in easily 20 years. After not talking for 20 years there was plenty to talk about. In all the talking I learned we both were divorced. Still single even. Which is nice. Allows us both to talk about whatever we want without worries. Some partners get jealous when talking to ex's. So it was a great conversation. Hope to do it again soon. So I offered up my number hoping she would give me a call back. She agreed she would. Even said she had a good time. So there is hope that she will. Could be a lot of fun. Even if it doesn't lead anywhere but a fun night. Would be worth it.,,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL4I2GS,0.0

I always sat there in my room, playing with my Barbies, but always wanted someone to play with. Of course I had friends my age, but “they couldn’t live with me,” my mother repeatedly told me after my crying sessions when they left. I wanted someone to mess with and blame things on. If I took the last cookie off the plate, I couldn’t blame anyone. It was clearly me. I mean, I loved being spoiled by both of my parents, but my dad wouldn’t want to sit down and have tea parties with me and my stuffed animals, and my mother got tired of it after an hour or so. So where did that leave me? Alone with Mr. Penguin with his overstuffed white belly, and my favorite pink bear with the bright yellow hat that I can’t remember the name of now. It was hot. Well maybe it wasn’t, but that’s how I felt. I tried to hide the tears that were about to come down by smiling. That always worked. “Cool,” I said. My dad could see that there was some subliminal message that I wasn’t telling him, but he went along with it. I stared into the baby’s big brown eyes, complemented by long eyelashes I envied. He looked back at me and smiled. “Hi Legend, I’m your big sister.” It was a regular day after school, but I decided to go over my dads for a little while before I went home. My dad picked me up from Broad & Olney and on the ride to his house, he blasted some good ole hip hip in his oversized truck. When we reached a parking spot, he stopped me. “Symone, I got a surprise for you.” “What is it,” I said eagerly.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2E2C0YWJ,0.0

I twisted my foot and ruptured my Achilles tendon in the process. Ouch! I immediately knew that I had a serious injury. The pain shot up from my ankle area and I could no longer stand up.  A couple of my fellow players helped me to a bench and I sat down, hoping that it was just a sprain that would heal up with time and ice.  But it soon became apparent that I should probably get the thing looked at. I didn't think that I could drive with my injury, so I got a friend to drive me to the clinic,  The doctor told me I was in for a long recover. Bummer! So I have been limping and babying my foot since that day. The tendon seems to be taking its sweet time healing. I am getting very tired of hopping along on crutches, but that is my fate until I am whole again. At work they call me ""Hopalong"". I think that I will play soccer again, but I will use ace bandage wraps on my ankles from now on.

After being at the same job for 25 years, I worked my last day. I had thought long and hard about this decision. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I made a good living, but I was bored with my job. Plus, I would miss seeing the same friendly faces every day. But I wanted more out of life. I wanted to travel and spend more time with my family. I wanted time for myself. My company was having a big retirement party for me. They laid out a big spread of food and there was a delicious retirement cake. My company gave me a watch to thank me for my 25 years of service. On top of that, my boss gave me some new luggage that he said I could use with all the travelling I wanted to do. The biggest surprise of all, was that all the employees chipped in and paid for a trip to Italy for my husband and I. They were really sending me off in style! I could not believe it. After the retirement party, I went and finished packing up my office. I was more emotional than I thought I would be. My coworkers that I was closest to, came by to give some private good byes. I had special gifts for all of them. I knew we would stay in touch, but we would not be chatting everyday any longer. The time had come for me to leave my office for the last time. I had such mixed emotions as I walked out that door. Now, one week later, as I am packing for my trip to Italy, I know I made the right decision. There is so much more to life than working, and I am ready to get out there and live my life to the fullest!",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UG617H9,0.0

We won the first two games easily without much trouble. Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals. Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half. The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point. In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee. Right away I knew it was bad. I spent a few minutes writhing around in pain before being helped off the court. I was forced to sit on the bench and ice my knee while the final minutes ticked away. Unfortunately we did not have the size on our bench to replace my height, and it cost us the chance for the championship. The final score was 85-84, and we ended up leaving with a second place trophy. After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while. Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating. My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament.

It was going to be a bit difficult because some of the classes were on another campus in a neighboring city. It kind of worried me because my car is older and has had some trouble and I didn't want it to break down during any of the trips. Also I wasn't sure I would be able to afford the gas cost. I am a full-time student, so I don't have a full-time job. It was only twice a week, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I ended up meeting some folks that were taking the same classes as me that also went to the other campus. We got to talking and figured out a ride-sharing schedule that allowed us to rotate who drove each other to and from the campuses. Like one person would drive this week and then another would drive next week and the next week I would drive, etc. That way no one person had to put the mileage on their car and we all chipped in for gas. I was so thankful that I met that group, because I was really having trouble making ends meet with how much gas I was using making those trips. It doesn't seem like much, but even a few bucks can make the difference for a college student. I like carpooling because we get to talk about a lot of things on the ride. I found out that Bob and I like the same hockey team and we are going to go to a game next week. I also learned that Jan is from my same hometown, we went to different highschools but we used to hang out at some of the same places.

I rem this day like it was yesterday. The most memorable day of my life was becoming a father. It was on June 23rd of 2019,I got off from work and decided to surprise my wife. I bought her some flowers and a very beautiful dress because i wanted to take her out for dinner. I was so excited to get home and see my wife after a long day at work. At this point my wife was 9 months pregnant and she was almost delivering but we knew she had like one week left before the baby comes. When i got home i found her sleeping on the couch watching a movie,i told her i had a surprise for her en i asked a to go and freshen up cause i wanted to take her out. After the shower she tried the dress on and it looked perfect on her. As we were busy telling each other how good we looked that evening,she said she felt a sharp pain in her tummy,she ignored it,then came the pain again for the second time,she started screaming asking me to help her. that's when i knew it was time for my prince to come out,she looked so beautiful in that dress,honestly i got a little confused by that situation cause i didn't know what to do first. I remembered the scenes in the movies where a man took the car keys first,that's exactly what i did,i helped her down the stairs and we headed to the hospital. As i was driving my heart and mind were racing,i so nervous,we got to the hospital and the doctors took her  to a private ward,the doctor asked me to relax that my wife was gonna be okay,i tried but i couldn't relax at all,i was anxious and nervous at the same time. I had to call my mom and sister to come and be with us at the hospital,my mum was so excited about the news,my heart kept pounding but again i couldn't help the excitement of becoming a father,i was so happy because this was gonna be my first child. After few minutes my mom and sister arrived,then the doctors came out smiling,when i saw the smiles it calm me down and i knew all was well,they told me its a boy and he was normal and healthy,believe me nothing can measure the joy and pride i felt that day,i jumped up and down hugging my mum and sister,i remember i even cried,they were tears of joy. I couldn't wait to hold my little man,my mini me,we were allowed to go in and see my wife and kid,when she saw me she started smiling and she said,""you are a father now,i love you"",i couldn't believe holding a baby that belongs to me for the first time,we had waited for so long before my wife could get pregnant but on 23rd of June 2019 she gave me a son. I will never forget this day even if i get old,this is a very special day to me,the day i became a father. I am so happy to be a father and i thank God for my son.",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZMFUVD9,0.0

She was determined to start her own lipgloss line. At first, I was a bit skeptical, since she had been prone to picking up hobbies and tossing them aside quite often throughout her youth. However, I quickly realized that she had put a considerable amount of thought into this and was surprisingly passionate about it. I was quite happy for her to say the least and was myself determined to help her in any way that I could. The primary aspects she wanted help with were the packaging and the pricing for her products. I was pleased to find that she was so deep into the process of creating this lipgloss line. Of course, I thought these were great ideas to start with. To start, we went to a nearby crafts and art supplies store and decided to spend much of the day browsing the extensive collection for what would work best. She already had her mind set on packaging that was bold and memorable. We looked first at the most striking colors and materials we could find. To my surprise, she was immediately taken by a combination of colors and materials, as though she had fully established in her mind the design she'd be going for. We selected our packaging supplies and were thrilled we had made it so far so efficiently. We then thought extensively about pricing. She had several ideas and was confident that they would work. I searched online for similar pricing models for makeup and lipgloss lines and quickly found that my daughter's ideas were in line with the common pricing trends. The whole day proved to be a success and I love that my daughter has finally found an aspect of her life she can be fully involved in and passionate about. It warms my heart.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JNAND1Q,0.0

We share a lot about our love lives, even though we don't see each other super often.  She knows that I'd been really happy in my relationship and was eager to meet him.  It finally so happened that schedules aligned and we were able to meet up.  I was a little nervous at first.  I wasn't worried that she wouldn't approve or anything, but it's always a little bit of an unsure situation introducing people you're dating to old friends. We met at the restaurant, a local burger joint/bar.  The three of us had a great time! Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully.  Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house.  Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog.  My boyfriend made fast friends, and it was really sweet seeing him interact with her dog.

I had no clue. Looking back it is honestly crazy how I was with such an abusive persona and with a drug addict. How could I be with someone like this and have no clue? This just proves how much abuse can blind you. I would tell anyone going through the same situation that there is hope. Things get better with time, that is a promise.

It was a gorgeous ride over and we enjoyed the view. As we hit the island, we rented bikes and got a map. We spoke to a couple of locals to get ideas what would be good to see. We headed toward Edgartown to see the Lighthouse. We rode the beaches we Jaws was filmed. We also happened upon an oceanside restaurant. We had a late lunch on the patio overlooking the water. It had great seafood. On our way back to our port town, we walked through the historic Victorian cottages that were built in the 1800s. The village is adorable and some have been in families for generations. It is much like the Mel Gibson movie, The Man Without a Face. Families spend all summer on the island.

The hospital staff went through their many procedures to induce labor.  By Thursday morning, the hospital staff told us we should expect our baby by noon.  Noon came and went,no baby.  Next we were told by three they would be here.  At three o'clock, still no baby.  After much pushed our lovely daughter finally arrived at 5:48.

To celebrate my birthday and to for general relaxation I decided to take a vacation. I went to Saint Lucia for 10 days and 9 nights. This in and of itself is not out of the ordinary or remarkable, as I have done something to commemorate the date of my birth every year since I was born.  What was notable about this particular vacation was that it was the first time that I travel with a sex worker as a companion. I was a bit apprehensive about the idea at first. I did not want to a bad experience with someone who has a disagreeable personality. I am experienced in dealing with sex workers, but only on a short term basis i.e. a matter of hours. Also, I spent some time living in Saint Lucia during my childhood. This vacation was going to be nostalgic and had sentimental value to me and I did not want to spoil that. After much deliberation I decided to travel with a beautiful provider I have been working with for nearly two years now.  She has been quite lovely and professional through out the time that I have had the pleasure of working with her.  One of the things I enjoyed about her was that she was comfortable sharing the same bungalo at the resort. We made time to spend together and also had separate engagements. I even visited the town of Black Bay where I lived as a child.",3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0EF39H6,,0.0

He was seriously injured from the accident and had actually died and needed to resuscitated on his way to the hospital. I thought I would lose him. He had broken his C7 vertebrae, crushed his larynx, pharynx and paralyzed his vocal cords. During his stint at the hospital he was handling it well. He wasn't very happy about it but he was pushing through and just continued to be himself. Every day his voice is getting a little bit stronger and he is scheduled to get the tracheotomy taken out soon. This will relieve the family of a lot of the everyday nursing duties that we've shared. It will be a bit of a recovery time for him but the doctors think he is ready and he is beating all standards so far so we are not going to be ones to disagree with him. Right after he had a consultation he wanted to go to the motorcycle dealership to look at new bikes. He already has his eyes set on a new a one. I told him that when he was ready to buy a new one I would buy one with him too. Granted he will probably buy a much nicer bike than I will but is nice to be able to still share that with him. He won't be able to ride for a bit but we are both hopeful. It is very satisfying to see that even a huge accident wouldn't deter him from his love of motorcycles. He has been riding forever and we were all worried if he would become scared of them. I don't think any of us expected him to want to get back on so soon but he just loves them so much. I'm just glad he is progressing steadily and can keep looking to the future.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0BF7KCU,,0.0

Where we live is very touristy and it being a summer weekend, there was a lot of traffic. But there was far more traffic than normal today. We thought it was probably normal since we don't normally leave our house on a Sunday, but after waiting for a very long time, we thought there must be something wrong. After quite awhile, a vehicle started passing everyone in the opposite lane, which we thought was crazy! So my husband called one of his employees (a park ranger, which is a police officer for a state park) and told him that a vehicle just passed everyone and they were driving strange. The park ranger said that vehicle had just reached him, that they were all responding to an accident (the passer was an off-duty fireman responding to the call). There had been a fatal accident. A car with a father, mother, and three kids had pulled out in front of an oncoming large SUV. Two children died in the accident. We eventually reached the scene and it was horrifying. It made me rethink our tiny car we drive with our three sweet children. I try not to think about that day. I do, however, stay even more cautious while driving than I used to. Like I mentioned earlier, it is very touristy here and those tourists drive unsafely - people not realizing they're on a highway at a high speed and just pulling out in front of others, passing people on the shoulder, etc... it gets so hectic. I hated that day. I hated to hear that someone's children died. It was definitely on our mind for awhile.",3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWEDLQH3P,,0.0

I recall the day we left for her move in day.  i thought it was going to be tear filled and sad, but there was more excitement and forward thinking on the way out to Buffalo NY.  She was excited to start her new life away from the day to day home life and start moving towards her academic and professional goals in he new life going forward.  We found that she joined a couple of groups at school related to her chosen pre-dental profession and related academics in sciences and math.  She also is involved in a networking group to stay up to date on changes and trends in dental fields and orthodontics.  i'm excited for her and happy to see her drive and ambition so early on in her collegiate career.  As we reflected back on the month or so building up to moving her off to school, my wife and I seemed to realize that our feelings, though justified, were more about how we felt and our anxiousness about her leaving and not really about how she felt and what her ambitions are,  I am glad we found that she was looking forward to this new life and that she was nervous like us but seems to have it under control.  She has a roommate and other friends in the same pre-dental studies and they work well together and have a study group.  That makes me proud as a parent and glad to see that my worries were for nothing and she is so well adjusted to college life.  High school seems so long ago and the strides she has taken in the past couple of months are impressive.  Maybe it is because of necessity but nonetheless she is ahead of the curve related to others I have seen and heard about at her stage of the game.  As parents we have gone from worrying stressed out and nervous people to proud and excited parents.  The transition has been painless and she has led the way without our interaction.  I think the most impressive part is that she is not the same person at school as she is at home.  She is very quiet, sort of lazy, and not proactive at home and it seems she is the ultra opposite away at school.  I would like to say it is like that for most parents a they see their oldest grow up fast and do well but some friends and neighbors have some stories that would make me cringe at what they tell me if it is true.",3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZP1WCU,,0.0

I was the helper of my household so things was hecked at times that I couldn't comprehend. So in this it was needful to find that help to help me relax from being overwhelmed.  I only had half knowledge of what that was and I felt as though I was burden with responsibility. So these past last six months my prayers was answered slowly but surely. The only thing i did was go to a store and ask a question. Not knowing the odds she would answer yes that she will help me. It may have taken weeks for a reply back form her. But when she called we didn't instantly connected the conversation was scattered at times. Then all of sudden she needed my help, that caused a door to be opened for me to gain guidance from her through couponing. She taught me how to shop and how to coupon within different stores. In my helping her she wasn't selfish in her giving and I was accomplishing more in saving then I even have. Also, the friendship we built was even better than ever. I was able get my head above water with her help and she gain a helpful friend. So i am thankful for God in so much ways that he answered my prayer just in time.",3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJMP1ZUH,,0.0

The most suprising thing to me was the fact that it happened and the emotions I felt. It is unreal when something so painful happens, that you think will never happen. I also never knew the strength of negative emotions I could feel. I thought I knew pain before, but I was never remotely close to feeling real pain. There were many sleepless nights spent crying, and feeling like I was just going to fall over and die. The extreme anxiety and panic attacks I experienced were terrible. I look back wondering how I made it through. After surviving the worst time period of my life I learned that I can take something awful and get some good form it. I think the only way to survive something so bad it to find a way to see something good come from it. I am able to help others, and connect with other bereaved parents who have helped me survive. I can be that person who saves someone from going down the wrong path to handle grief. There have been a couple people who were here for me in that way. That is the best way to handle a bad situation. You have to find something positive to take from it, and use it in a good way.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4XKVKT1,,0.0

The first few hours were not to bad they were a little loud, almost like having children in the backseat. Then a couple more hours in to the trip their true colors started to show. They started to argue almost every second, which made the trip pretty miserable. They are also huge chain smokers so the ten hour trip gained a few hours due to the frequent stops and long stops for them to smoke their cigarettes. At every stop it would take them about thirty minutes to do their business. In the car it would just be moments of silence followed by yelling followed by making out. It was one of the most uncomfortable trips ever. At the wedding they got into more fights which only made the trip back home even worse. There was more fighting more yelling and due to their stress over arguing we needed to make more stops so that they could smoke even more. It was so uncomfortable, I could not even look to the back of the car because I did not want to see them either arguing with each other or making out. By the end of it I wanted to jump out of the car. Who knew that people in their twenty's could still act like teenagers.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,,0.0

The most memorable part was reconnecting with him and getting to meet his 3 children, who he didn't have the last time I saw him.  I took them around the city and showed them a lot of the popular attractions around here. I think they were happy to get the super in depth tour, and got to show them things that other people probably wouldn't know about visiting here. The event was significant to me, because its important to maintain relationships with family. It was both about the past and the future to some degree. In a way seeing him again reminded me of several events from my past, and allowed me to remember some of those past events with him. Seeing him again also was positive because it sort of reignited our relationship, and we now have a bit of basis to build on to further enhance our relationship going forward. Meeting his family was very important as well. They are already almost young adults themselves now, and it was important for us to connect so that they knew who their extended family is.  We have already been in a touch a bit more since we last met. I am hoping we can keep the momentum going. The event overall was pretty significant for me because it put family in the forefront of my mind. It kind of reassures me to know that no matter how much time passes, or how far away you are, there is always an opportunity to reconnect with family. I'm definitely going to try to go visit him within the next year or two to keep in touch and keep time between us shorter.",3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1AAJYKX5,,0.0

My chapter was called to an out of town meeting one weekend.  When we got there I was immediately put to work.  I was sweeping the club house and fetching drinks as the members held their meeting in the other room.  At one point my fellow prospects and myself were sent outside.  While outside we did some work on the fence and otherwise just hung out and talked.  I got to know a couple of the prospects from that chapter as well and we got along great.  Then at one point myself and another prospect were called in front of the members.  We were grilled with questions like asking how many days we had and what we learned in that time.  At one point another member came up behind me and pulled my prospect cut off me.  I struggled a bit but he eventually got it off me and asked if I wanted it back.  If I did I would have to go through him.  My heart was racing and I was about to do it too, but then I heard the snap of a can opening.  As I turned around I saw several brothers walking up to me with open cans and proceeded to dump them on my and my other brothers head.  The feeling was cold but still felt so good knowing what it meant.  I felt a great sense of accomplishment and pride knowing my hard work has paid off.  I was then handed a set of patches to put on my cut and I went to work.  We had a few beers and then had to get back on the road.  I reeked of beer the whole way home but it was worth it.",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0Y5QRF,,0.0

It completely broke my heart because I never knew how hard it was going to be not being able to save one of them.  I had picked her up from the shelter along with a mother cat and two kittens.  Those babies did fine and got adopted pretty quickly.  I had renamed the kitten Minnow because she was just so impossibly tiny.  Her mother had been apparently a feral female cat and they had just managed to trap Minnow instead of both.  At the time she was probably all of five weeks.  She seemed healthy when I brought her home and was eating fine but a few weeks later she started losing weight rapidly and going downhill fast.  We tried electrolytes and she perked up for a bit and I had her eating this super high calorie after surgery food they give animals for recovery.  She seemed to be doing well but then I walked in one morning and she was having seizures in her pen.  I called my rescue leader to come help and B took her home to do an IV but it was too late.  We later discovered she had a liver defect and she just wasn't able to get the proteins and fats she needed to survive. It was a terrible situation and my heart still hurts.  I have used this as a learning experience though so going forward I know what to do when these things happen.  I have a little willow doll specifically for her and for the other foster babies I may lose in the future.,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ042QH91,,0.0

I nearly immediately got a job, had an apartment, was doing pretty alright. Ended up losing my apartment and did not particularly know what to do. Luckily, a friend lived in the area and I started staying with them. It was difficult to get to work. One day, the car got a flat and I was not able to get to work. I did not / could not be too much of an imposition, so this was a major loss for me. I ended up developing an infatuation with my friend's roommate, but was unsure how long things would last seeing as he was moving out of the area fairly soon. After he left, I soon had to leave too.  I would help out, was not getting paid and really had no place to go. I slept in my car for a while, which was fairly terrifying. I would go on walks among the redwoods in the morning, work during the day and hang out with friends in the area. Everything was alright, but fairly terrifying and full of doubt and mystery. I eventually ended up moving in with my beau, and am hoping to get even more on my feet.

I had build an L-shaped couch with air mattresses for them to sit. A table full of snacks, candies, and soda where all set. The tent was up , with even a fridge added inside. We allowed the girls to purchase two movies to watch , whatever they wanted.  This was of course after the pizza , cake and presents were done. Then they headed outside. I can recall just hearing them laugh and being typical teenage girls. I wont ever forget that night since i was exhausted from preparing everything . But especially since the girls never went to bed! My bedroom was right near the tent so i heard them all night. I specifically recall them at 6 am saying there was donuts inside. As they ran to the front door i jumped out of bed and ran as well . Since a stampede of teenage girls were about to raid my kitchen. Overall , the girls ate there donuts and one by one went home. It was a success and i made it throught the whole ordeal .

We went to San Diego, California. It was my daughter's first plane ride and only my son's 2nd plane ride. We were nervous about the vacation because we didn't know how our children would do flying together. Our daughter gets scared of a lot of things so we didn't know how she would handle being on the plane. We ended up having an amazing time, though. We booked to stay at the same hotel my wife and I stayed at for our honeymoon. It is right near the water in San Diego, has an amazing view, and has a tremendous pool there with water slides. Our kids loved it and we even stayed in the same tower of the hotel that my wife and I were in when we went on our honeymoon. We ended up going to Sea World as the first big stop on our vacation. We spent, literally, the entire day there. We got there right when it opened up and we didn't end up leaving until it was about to close. One of the cool things about what we did there is we got this food pass. With this pass, you can eat a meal at up to like 8 different restaurants, every hour! We certainly got our fill of food and it was also a nice way to take breaks from walking and going all the time to just sit, eat and let the kids relax before going to the next show or the next activity. We also spent a lot of time during the trip at Belmont Park. It's got carnival rides, carnival games, all sorts of shops and great food. We really had a good time there. Our last stop on the trip was to the San Diego Wild Animal Park. You get to ride a tram around the park and see various animals from Africa and Asia. A really cool experience! The kids loved seeing those kinds of animals up close and not just in some cage. All in all, we had an amazing time and the kids were great.

My Wife and I just arrived in Portland, Oregon. It is our first time to the city. The airport was older, but still OK, we did not spend much time there. We took a lyft to our hotel, and the driver informed us about a protest that was scheduled for that day. We were unaware of that protest. The driver told us that the proud boys, anti-fa, and the pride rally were all meeting to protest one another. The protests started peaceful, until the protesters began to interact. At the time, the proud boy group was mostly tame, which is out of character for the group. Surprisingly, anti-fa began attacking the pride rally. I was not expecting this, i thought both groups were aligned on the same side of the political spectrum. Anti-fa attacked pride members with ""concrete milkshakes"" which were milkshakes make with quick dry concrete. This attack happened a block from our hotel. A few hours into the ""protest"" homeland security dressed in full tactical gear were dispatched and took control of the square where the protests were happening. This was a shock to my wife and I. We were not expecting this when we arrived to Portland! Turns out, this is fairly common in Portland. The hotel only told us to avoid the protests, and they did not seem surprised by the officers in tactical gear. One of the most odd experiences we had was the next morning. We ate breakfast at a food truck that was parked in the square where the protests happened. We ate breakfast in a peaceful square on a beautiful morning, like nothing had happened just a few hours before. It was truly an interesting start to our trip and something i will not soon forget.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QT3XJF3,,0.0

She had cancerous cells found in her ovary and it was a relatively simple and minor surgery. They had taken her back for her pre-op checks and everything seemed to be fine. They started her on anesthesia and that's when her heart stopped. They got her heart started again and the doctor came out to speak with me. He said it happens sometimes with patients and that they were going to postpone the surgery to do more tests and see how she does. They ran tests and it seemed to be a fluke that it happened since everything came back normal and healthy. A week later she had the surgery without any complications. When the doctor told me what happened, the world just stopped and I felt like everything was in slow motion. Until he said that she was alive and fine, I ran through all of the things that I would have to do as well as try to comprehend the loss of my best friend and mother. I had a panic attack set in and started crying and shaking. It took me about 30 minutes to be able to get my body under control and to get my emotions under control to go and see my mother. I didn't want her to see me upset because that would upset her more than she already was.  I love my mother more than anything in the world and she's my best friend. It was one of the scariest moments of my life and I hope that I don't have to go through that for a very long time.",35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCHZOEO2,,0.0

I know that I felt that I was part of something more and among people who were just like me. I was also happy to just be there with my loved ones and it was my nephews first time at a convention so it was really exciting. I was really happy when I got to meet some comic people who wrote on my favorite book Harley Quinn. Jimmy and Amanda Conner were some of the coolest people that I met that day. I got to tell them how much their comic meant to me and got to thank them for doing the great work that they did. I felt that they were really humbled people and it was so exciting to meet them for the first time. My girlfriend who is my wife now got to meet spike from buffy and she was happy about that and it was a good moment because of how kind the person was to everyone. We also got to get alot of cool items that we had not gotten before from other places so I felt we got alot of unique stuff ourselves.  But the one part of the convention that was a high light was getting to Meet Kevin Conroy. The line itself was really long and some of the people who were waiting were kind of rude especially one guy that made kevin take a picture of himself and was just pretty silly and embarrassing in the end. But I was just glad and happy I got to meet one of my idols growing up and just meeting them for a few minutes was just one of the highlights and moments that I would hold for myself. I had a great time and felt that because I was with my peers that I was able to enjoy it more. It was also more fun because of my family that went with me. I know that my nephew loved it and I got to spend time with him. I got to spend time with my girlfriend and grow our relationship more too.,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXKSWLDV,,0.0

My little niece has gone and grown up some and has started kindergarten.  She is a great little girl and I love her so much.  I have spent so much time with her and she has depended on me for a lot and I have gotten used to taking care of her and her being with me a lot of the time. See she has went through a lot as a little girl and I was there through it all. The hospital stays and the seizures and even the little things like having a cold. But she finally reached the age of Kindergarten and whether I liked it or not she was ready to go. I mean all kids have to do that at some time. I was worried about her too because it would be the first time that she was gone all day also. Well it has went okay. She likes it and she has made a lot of friends already.  She has also learned so much. She really is enjoying herself and having a good time in life.  I am glad it is working out for her and that she is happy and I have gotten used to it also and am able to enjoy some time that I am not chasing after a silly little girl. We will continue to make memories together and there will be other times in life that there will be change and hopefully it is as good as this has been.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO73KHU,,0.0

There had never been an event like this before, so it was intense, fun, and only at the price of $15 for admission. Each group that went on showed power, intensity, and all around had a great time. All of the groups on the sidelines cheered on for each other and took pictures and videos of the event and the groups performing. We all had a love for each other that could not be explained. I truly felt part of a community bigger than myself and was proud of each and every group that performed. My greatest surprise were the students attending the event. They danced NON STOP for three hours straight. The physical capability and determination was beyond overwhelming. In the end everyone was exhausted, but so happy at the event turnout. The event was a huge success because we were able to raise a lot of funds and get a lot of donations for the children in Haiti for their upcoming school year. After this event was over, we were already planning to do another event just like this one, and many of the groups were already planning for the future.",37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N,,0.0

My hubs is not the type to go above and beyond for things, but he is thoughtful. So when he said we could go to my favourite restaurant, Hamirs, and go and see a movie, I was excited to do so! I had not been to Hamir's in so long, and I know my hubs isn't the biggest Indian food fan, so I thought it was so sweet that he would want to go there anyway, even though it's not his favourite. When we went to Hamirs, I noticed there were gorgeous sheets in these beautiful Indian prints hanging over the front windows. Usually the windows are really open and you can see inside. When we walked in, I was completely overwhelmed to see about a dozen of my friends and close co-workers! I was so surprised! When I was hugging everyone and screaming and smiling and 'yay'ing' over it, I noticed in the corner, my best friend from HS, waiting for me!! I couldn't believe it! She had come all the way from Massachusetts to see me! I started crying and she started crying, and we had such a moment! I had not seen her for about 3-4 years. The food was absolutely amazing and the conversation and just ambiance was so perfect! Hamir made my favourite dish, which is the chicken tandoori! The dinner and my friends showing up was a big enough gift, but I also received so many awesome gifts! Lots of Starbucks and Sephora gift cards! My best friend got me a Kate Spade wallet. My mom and sister got me a new pair of headphones. My husband went above and beyond for this one, it was crazy. I couldn't believe he went to all this, and behind my back without me knowing. Somehow, he was able to reach out to everyone. When I asked him how he did it, he said he found our addresses/email list that I keep on excel on our computer, and he was able to contact everyone via the email addresses I had in there. I was super bummed because I didnt take any photos but luckily, so many of my friends came through! When I got on facebook and IG the next day, there were so many tagged photos. It was awesome to see the different people in my life all in one space. My work friends, my new friends my old friends, and my family. I never really had many big birthday parties in my life, and I never had a surprise party, so this was a first for me, and it is truly something that I will treasure for a long time.",3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHYPG3WW7,,0.0

She received a call that he had been found in his cell unconscious. She traveled over there and he never really did regain full faculties. The state released him to her and she had him transported over here to our state so she could take care of him. He lasted around 6 months before his body systems failed him. We buried him in the local cemetery. It was a very sad occassion to have to bury such a young man under such horrible circumstances. We have concated an attorney in the state of Florida. He is looking it finding any video or eye witness to what could have happened. The guards nor the prison are forthright at all. I know she needs these questions answered. When you lose one of 2 children in such a manner you need answers. I have my doubts though that she will find answers.

Getting my horse pregnant was a very tricky operation. She had a curved cervix so it took many tries before she finally tested positive. I moved her to a facility that solely dealt with equine reproduction. One day I was lucky enough to arrive at the facility just as she was giving birth. I was told by the people who run the place beforehand that most likely I wouldn't be able to be present because more often than not, horses give birth in the middle of the night. So it was some very good fortune that we arrived in time to experience it. When we got to the facility, I didn't see my horse. The thought even crossed my mind that she was stolen. But then I saw she was on the ground, in labor. The whole process was amazing. I had mixed feelings of excitement and concern for my horse. Horses can have breech births. This can sometimes can result in both the mother and foal dying. But I didn't need to be concerned. The birth was amazingly fast. My horse got on her feet immediately. She was very attentive to her foal. The best part for me was seeing the filly get to her feet. It was a bit of a struggle at first and she was very wobbly.

A few months ago,  i was having a deep talk with my father. My father was a very tough  person, very strict and religious i would say, and for that i was afraid of him. We are not that close ,i was more closed to my mother . I was quite feminine and no girlfriend yet.     I am pretty nervous because the topic might go towards my sexuality and it does . My father asked me ,do you have a girlfriend? I said no i don't have,  are you gay, i don't know what to say at this point i was very nervous. I just said if I said no are you going to believe or if I said yes are you going to accept me?  My father said ever since you are a child i knew it , i just don't have the courage to asked. and i accept you regardless because you are my son and i love you. I was in tears  and overwhelmed with happiness because i am finally free of myself of always being afraid to be found out by others. Constant thinking of other people might say or thinking it hurts me so much and my well being, it was not healthy for me.      Whenever i was thinking of that moment i was very happy for myself and my family . God i love my family they mean the world to me, I don't know what to do without them. My coming out story is very important that i will never forget.  I hope i might inspire others to be themselves and other might accept them for who are they really are.

He works for a great rate but doesn't communicate and sometimes has take over a month to do a job.  So this was one of those times. I went out of state for 3 weeks and dropped it off, assuming that he could do the job while I was gone and I wouldn't be waiting when I got back.  It all was very efficient.  Well, I got back to town and guess what? The job still wasn't done.  I was told it would be done the next day.  Nope.  The next week. Nope.  Then I just wasn't told anything. So while this is going on, another friend who knows how these mechanics can be had a Subaru sitting in his driveway that he didn't want anymore.  It was in a bit of rough shape and certainly understandable why it was being given away, but the interior was nice and more importantly it drives like a dream.  I couldn't believe how cool this was because the friend I speak of, who gave me the car, was barely a friend at this point. We had maybe hung out 2 or 3 times.  It was just completely unexpected and came at a great time.  I was able to sell my Jeep to someone who really needed it and the car has treated me well for the most part.

It was determined that one of the babies did not have enough amniotic fluid and her heart beat was indicating some stress with the mild contractions I was having. I began to panic thinking about all the things I had not completed that I desired to complete before the arrival of our twins. I was admitted to the hospital within the hour. I was hooked up to multiple machines and given medication to make labor move along more quickly. The pain became quite intense about 6 hours into this and I was given the option for n epidural, which my doctor stated was the best option in the event I needed and emergency csection. I opted for the epidural and when I was given the medication My blood pressure dropped so low instantly I passed out. When I woke I was surrounded by hospital staff and being given multiple medications. A few hours after this it was time for delivery and I succesfully and safely delivered 2 babies with no surgical intervention. We stayed in the hospital for several days. The twins needed a little extra help to ensure they were going to be ok with eating and gaining weight. Even though baby B was a footling breech delivery she was perfect and healthy. The hospital staff treated them like little celebrities because there had never been a natural twin birth in that hospital before and they were all in awe of the babes. The babies gather nuch attention every where we go. This has been quite a challenge for me as an introvert with a fear of small talk. Maybe someday when I have gotten a decent nights sleep it will come easier.",3NPFYT4IZDQKQ2C1KRDZVX9HXJ0XGQ,,0.0

We are seniors and the whole experience was very daunting. Selling our house that we lived in over 40 years was a struggle. Then we had the issue of what to do with our to beloved dogs.  This caused internal family problems that still haven't been totally resolved as of this date. Finding a new place to live remotely was an issue that was helped somewhat by the help from our family and by extensive use of the internet. As it turned out, we ended up with a home that someone off offhandedly remarked was available and it turned out to be just right for us. Next objective was to buy a car. Very little funds were available. The car shopping took time. Many hours spent shopping around. Finally the right car at the right price was found.

It was from the hospital stating that they would start taking 25% out of his check each week to pay back his bills. This is really hard when you live basically paycheck to paycheck. My husband gets paid twice a month so that is almost $500 we are losing each month until it is paid off.  This is basically a whole month's rent minus like $25. We are struggling, but we are making it. I turk every day to help which I already did, but now it is more of I have to then I want to. We have tried not to change the way we live as we don't want to worry the kids something is wrong, but we have cut back on eating out. We might struggle every month, but we find a way to survive. Some bills are a little late, but they are getting paid. I rather have things paid then getting cut off. We only have another couple of months to get through and it will be paid off. I believe we worked it out and we will be struggling until taxes in 2020. It has already been three to four months and we are making it work. That is all you can do.

They said it would be a reunion . I asked what they wanted me to bring and they told some things I could bring. I asked them why were they doing it because I thought maybe my dad was sick and nobody informed me of it. He is turning ninety this year . The one cousin I asked said just to come in, I think. So it kind of worried me  that something might be wrong with him.  But they came in and a lot of people were there and we had a good time. We ate and took pictures and showed each other pictures of all our families and people in our family who had died.  It was sad because our grandparents had died and all of my cousins parents had died . There was no one left on my dad's side but him. All his brothers and sisters and their spouses were dead. We gave each other small gifts and made to go boxes of left over food for everyone and then cleaned up the kitchen. One of my cousins was a photographer and we went outside and took a lot of outdoor pictures of everyone and later he put them online for us. It was good to see everyone and it felt like when we were all kids and were at our grandparents house eating her food and seeing each other, like at Christmas or Thanksgiving.  Most of them brought the food that grandma made when we were growing up so that made it feel even more like a family reunion .  It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us. He teared up some and I think everyone else did too. It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long. It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.  We made plans to see each other again in September and I am looking forward to that . Some of them have to fly in so not sure how many will make it.

It is not that I don't want to. It is just because they are not receptive to it. I know I cannot shove it down their throats because they will build a wall so quick to block it out. I have to be more subtle about it. When I took my niece shopping a few months back, she brought up something that was from the bible. She was not having a biblical conversation, but she did have to mention a certain custom that was found in the bible. Naturally, she took a worldly view of it rather than read the entire book to understand the context. I was able to explain what the snippet she shared actually meant. She rarely listens when I am able to share something with her like this, but she was the one who brought it up so I did have her attention. It was like only climbing a foot up a 1,000 foot wall as far as progress goes, but this was much better than declining, which is usually what happens. I hope to have more chances in the future, but I know they will be hard to find. I am encouraged though by this. It means that she will be open once again to hear the gospel since she was this time.

I am not sure how the family will be able to cope with the upcoming holidays. My aunt came to visit us every Christmas and I know that it will be hard on all of us, especially my mother. My mother and aunt were the closest sisters I have ever seen. They talked on the phone every day. Now, I make sure to call my mother every day in an attempt to fill the void. I am also planning to spend more time with her so that she doesn't get lonely. I also try to call my cousin more often to check on him. He lost his father last year and now his mother was taken so suddenly. We are all still coming to terms with the shock.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08JYYCHD,,0.0

A former coworker, who I had a great working relationship with, reached out to me. She told me about how her new company was a leader in the industry. In addition, she mentioned how she was excelling in her current role with them and really enjoyed the work. She mentioned that I would be a great fit for an open position that they wanted to fill. This company was over 3,000 miles away from where I live. However, the most surprising thing is that they were willing to let me work remotely! This was definitely a surprise to me, especially since it is uncommon to have a full-time employee work remotely in this specific industry. I was shocked and extremely grateful for the opportunity. This experience was significant to me because it helped me be more grateful with my current circumstances. I also felt a closer bond to my former coworker and felt a sense of thanks, especially since she helped connect me to this position. I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me. I also learned about my specific feelings around work and my circumstances. I really need to reflect more and learn to count my blessings. We have limited time to live, and it is important for health and longevity to reflect on the good in life.",3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS5VZ9KZ,,0.0

We have always come out together in the end.  We support each other.  I feel as though we have a strong relationship and have each other's backs.

This year we managed to convince a new friend to go with us on top of our usual group. We traveled there during the middle of the day and were lucky enough to not have to deal with any snow this year. The previous year was quite snowy when we were driving up. We also managed to get lucky and get a room with a balcony again. We try our best to get one every year but since so many people are going it's often tricky to not find them all booked already. The balcony adds a really nice relaxing place to hang out where you can still see some of the event while taking a break up at your room, it really adds to the experience. The event has a 24-hour arcade that runs every day and we have found over the years that it's best to be up and night and sleep during the day. That way you get to enjoy the arcade with less people and can sleep when everything is super crowded. This year especially I mostly focused on the arcade so I was asleep a lot during the day and just stayed up all night. You also have to be careful about where you get food and when because of how busy everything is. Typically we get a bunch of snacks and things for our room to have something as filler since we aren't sure when we might manage to eat. We also try to make at least one trip to a nearby steak place every year we go, as well as a trip to the local Chinese food place. We did our best to teach our new attending friend our tricks but we mostly let him enjoy whatever he wanted to do and he ended up liking the event a lot which is good. I believe he managed to get something signed by a composer he likes. I hope he comes again next year and we can have another addition to our yearly crew. Overall it was a great time and I look forward to going again early next year. This is so far the main thing I do reliably every year so I hope we get to keep doing it. Hopefully we get lucky with the balcony room again and manage to not have it be too cold or snowy during the event itself.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6,,0.0

It started out when I had to work a double shift and came home ridiculously tired the night before. I had only slept a total of 4 hours before I heard the thud and the scream from my 7 year old son which felt like it filled the house. It was 6 am and I was immediately taken in an out of body experience which is all I can describe it as. I heard my son screaming for help and I immediately screamed for my wife because I thought I was going to find my daughter dead in her room. My son was crying over my daughter as she shook and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head. I was sure that she was choking on something and my son through tears kept telling me she may have swallowed a lego because they had been playing with them. I felt sick and told my wife to call the ambulance right away. We were screaming at each other and crying and I shoved my fingers in my daughters throat to try and get her airway clear because I was positive it was choking. I even started doing heart compresses. I thought she was going to be gone and I have never been more afraid. I felt myself outside of my body looking in at that moment. My son was terrified and I did not keep it together well for him. When the ambulance came my wife was sure it was a seizure by the way she was reacting after. She immediately fell asleep and we took her to the ER. She had to have an xray to confirm that there was nothing blocking her airways. It was the single most terrifying moment in my life. My daughter has epilepsy.,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQB420P4Y,,0.0

They're 2 old men in a really, really small town, you see. Anyway, they were in a fight, and when the owner saw me with me friend, he started yelling. He yelled that my friend was NOT allowed in my house (his property but I pay rent). He would NEVER set foot in there again. I was upset and told the owner that we needed to talk about this. I wanted him to explain to me what was going on, since I had no idea about their fight at the time. He shouted that no, he would not explain, and that if I hung out with my friend I am an idiot! He called me an idiot. Then he stalked off. I was so mad I didn't accept his (half-hearted) apology the next day, and then we were in a fight. I told him he can't just decide who is allowed at my house. He said he would rip up the contract and he didn't care. I thought about leaving, but after about 3 days we were able to talk civilly (my husband facilitated a lot of that because I was still angry) and we decided to stay. I'm glad we did!

I did that, and was cycling home, when suddenly I heard a weird noise, and noticed some pain in my back. I didn't realize what was going on, and just then I saw a car driving next to me, and some ugly dark-skinned subhuman face looking at me. It was then that I realized that I had been shot, with something, and saw that this hideous mongrel chick was trying to shoot me again. I yelled at her, and reached for my own gun, and the cowardly spawn of liberals drove off because they don't fight with people who are able to defend themselves. They got away before I could defend myself. I then went to the liquor store for beer, and was able to verify that it was a paintball gun I'd been shot with. My backpack and clothes were covered with the junk. My back hurt pretty good, and when I left the liquor store I cycled around for a bit to see if I might run into those beautiful brown skinned children of Obama again, but there was no such luck. I went back to my place, and looked in the mirror, and there was a nice golf-ball sized dent in my back where I'd been hit, surrounded by a big red welt. Liberal social justice had been served tonight. Cheered up by this realization, I had my beers and iced up my back, and tried to get over the whole thing, realizing it was inevitable as part of the progress that modern society needs to march forward bravely into the beautiful new era of liberalism.  Despite this, I resolved to be more ready to get my gun out in the future. I also decided to save up money for a longer range firearm in case preventive measures become necessary at some later date. Then I went to bed.",35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8ZUY3XT,,0.0

It was his birthday surprise party. My friend and I thought, whatever, it may be fun, so we went. We arrived and started mingling with a few friends and the boss' wife. Our boss came in, and was greatly surprised, but somewhat distant from the party. A few hours passed, and my friend and I were close to leaving. All of sudden, our boss runs down the stairs, yelling for someone to call the police. We got so worried and scared, and everyone started mumbling about what could possibly be going on. We over heard people talking about several things, but eventually found out that someone had stolen important documents from our boss' office. This scared us, because who could do that? Our boss was a great person, very caring and empathetic, and we would never dream of something like that happening at his party. The police came and everyone was questioned. We eventually were allowed to go home, but it stuck with us for sometime. Even work seemed different. And they never caught the person who stole the documents.

We had planned this week long vacation for several months in advance. It had been arranged so that we could visit relatives who live in the area. The morning we were to leave for our trip was very sunny so I woke up a few hours early from the light shining through my window. So, I used this extra time to finish packing my belongings that I had forgotten to pack the night before. We left around 9:30 on a warm, July Monday morning. It was a long trip and when we finally got there we were exhausted. So we decided to just rest and start out early the following morning. After that we went to Ride Niagara, a simulated ride over the Niagara Falls. It was rather realistic considering we never moved from a set position. After the ride, we met a French Canadian, who had a heavy accent and lived in Quebec. He helped us decide what attractions were worthwhile. After visiting a few of them we returned to the hotel worn out. On that Wednesday we rode on the Maid Of The Mist. When the boat reached close to the bottom of the falls everyone could feel the power of the falls by the incredible mist and loud roar of the falls. Later that day we went on a journey behind the falls, which took us through tunnels that actually opened up behind the falls. The lines for both these activities were very long so this took up most of the day. We spent another day visiting tourist attractions in that area. Then we decided to spend the rest of our time visiting our relatives. We saw many of our family members we haven? t seen in years. It was sad that we had to leave that Sunday, but we did. So we left for a long ride home with only the memories of our vacation.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D,,0.0

I first met GW when I went to work for my uncle at his business after I graduated from college. GW was my uncle's neighbor and he worked part time there. GW didn't talk a lot but he had a wicked sense of humor. He and his wife, AW, raised 4 kids together in the same house for 50 years. I didn't get to see GW often after I got a new job and moved but I heard for AW that GW wasn't feeling so well since last year. He was in and out of hospital a lot of the time. Then in March I got a call from AW that GW was in the hospital again and would like to see me and my uncle. I got the feeling that this might be the last time we will speak to each other again. This might be the goodbye the we all dreaded. On a beautiful Saturday I drove my uncle and my aunt to visit GW at the hospital. On the way there we bought him some flowers for the room. When we got there I could hardly recognize GW. He looked so thin and frail and his cheeks sunk in quite a bit. I felt so sad that some tears actually came out. GW was asleep so we asked a nurse to wake him. He was groggy but very happy to see us. Even though he was physically deteriorating I could see that his mind was as sharp as even and his sense of humor was still there. I stuck my hand out to shake his hand and he held mine for a long time like he didn't want to let go. His hand felt cold and weak. I got emotional again and almost cried again but I held it in. I didn't want GW to worry so I put on a brave face and smiled. Before we left I told GW to get better soon and we'll be waiting for him at home. For the rest of the day I felt a bit melancholy and down. Seeing GW like that reminded me of how fleeting and fragile life is and it scared me.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPFO1AZC,,0.0

I also heard stories in person from friends about what they did over the weekend with other friends. Not once the entire holiday season was I invited to any of these events despite the fact that mutual friends were all included. I realize that I become quite a hermit during the winter months so I don't typically do much but it would be nice to at lease be given the option of going. December was relatively mild compared to previous years so I might have done more if I had been given the option. I'm sure that if my friends heard me talking this way, they would make excuses like ""we didn't want to just have you watch us skate"" or ""we know how cold you get outside"" or ""we know you need to be careful about germs."" The problem is, no one asked and gave me the choice to decide for myself. They made the decision for me that the event was something I wouldn't want to do. I often become a little down during the winter months and this is the exact reason why. I sit in my house for weeks at a time without any contact with people (besides my daughter and home care workers) other than Facebook. It makes me feel really frustrated and lonely. People often say ""well, you should plan something"" or ""invite people over."" I do those things but I don't feel like I should always have to initiate social events especially when there are events going on that are already planned. During the winter months, my days are nearly exactly the same each day. I get up, work, take care of my daughter, and go to bed. I really have very little to look forward to except spring.

I should do some Internet research and find out what was going on with my system.	And I still find it .... interesting, that after taking the medication I was given to make me eat, I now eat regularly with no problem.

He had been with me during some of the post painful periods in my life, and I couldn't imagine life without him.  The regular medicines were not working, so we put him on a newer med that I heard could give Pip a couple of extra years, the downside is that they also came with horrible side effects for some dogs.  I think that we all imagine that our pet will not be part of the 20% and that it will be the cure that wee are looking for.  Pip initially responded well and he seemed to be getting back to his old self.  However in a couple of weeks, symptoms, started to show again and we had to up the dose.  A few days later, Pip seemed uncomfortable while I was getting ready for work.  After I dropped the kids off at school, something told me to go back to the house and check on him.  He was lying on his side, foam going from his mouth, panting...the worst part was that there seemed to be a look of terror on his face.  I will never forget that look or forgive myself for giving him those meds.  Pip was put to sleep later that morning.  I continue to research the medication that I had given him to see if anything pops up that I should have noticed before giving it to him.  It's like I can't let go.  It's almost like I have to find ways to continue to punish myself because I am the one who caused that look of fear in his eyes.  I do make it a point to warn anyone I know who's dog develops Cushings about the medication.",388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DWZ80RB,,0.0

I was midway through my pregnancy, which is a difficult time as the visits to the doctor are still spaced four weeks apart. This means that for four agonizing weeks, we do not know for sure how the baby is doing. Once we visit the doctor, we can get confirmation that her heart is beating and that she is growing on track, but until then, we do not know for sure. Once the baby starting kicking, however, it was almost a lifeline back to sanity and away from anxiety, as I at least knew that she was alive and moving. That said, it was easy to start wondering if it was really her I felt kicking, as she was still so small and the kicks were fairly light. At times of worry, I would start to wonder if I was imagining it, or if it was digestion, or something akin. One night, though, the kicks felt quite strong, and I asked my husband to touch my belly and see if he could feel them. His eyes lit up, and he said he felt them. He lifted his finger each time he felt a kick, to see if it corresponded with what I felt. Sure enough, the kicks were at exactly the same time I felt them. This confirmation of my experience, and the chance to share it with my partner, was incredibly moving for both of us. It felt like our connection deepened and grew, and we were both filled with awe and excitement. Since then, we have had our baby. There have been many more meaningful moments, but this first shared touch still holds a special place in my heart.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J8OFZ3U,,0.0

The main of honor was the bride's sister and the best man was the groom's brother. My cousin looked absolutely amazing in her dress and she seemed to really feel comfortable in it. The ceremony was short and sweet and then the party got started. We enjoyed a delicious dinner that was served family style at out table.  After dinner, the open bar really got going and people were ready to party and dance the night away. There was the standard father-daughter dance and the groom-mother dance. While I myself refrained from drinking too much, my aunt did not follow the same game plan. I looked over a one point and she was dancing with a glass of tequila in her hand. After a few hours of repeating this behavior, she got really sick and threw up all over the table. It was embarrassing, but in our family embarrassing is the norm. Overall, minus the vomit, everyone had a great time. It was such a treat to spend time with some family member and celebrate a new party of life beginning.",3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVRUNEZ20,,0.0

It was almost unbelievable. I instantly knew that I had to fly out to see him and be with him during this difficult time. It wasn't a cheap trip, by any means, but it was necessary. I waited a few days for things to calm down a bit before finding information about his mother's memorial ceremony. Once that date was concrete I scheduled my flight to be there with him. Once I got to where he lives we spent almost 7 hours just talking about what has been new and how he was doing. It was a great conversation and I'm really happy that we got to have it. We spoke about memories about his mom and memories we all had together. We also got into his feelings and how he was doing with everything. I like to think that that trip helped him out a lot as having a childhood friend there would be comforting. After that night, we had the ceremony the following day and it was incredibly sad. We watched a film reel and her surviving family went up on stage and spoke about her. It was a good experience but it was a sad one as well. My best friend was clearly and understandably emotional during this time but made it through and I could tell that he was incredibly appreciative of the fact that I was there. After that we spent some more time together and I flew back home. We have been in touch consistently since then and he has been doing better.

It is so hard to let go of a dog that you love with all your heart. Petey was exceptional as a pet. He was my best friend for so many years. Daily I see reminders of him in my house, on the internet and when I am out and about. I pass an exit where I used to get his medicine, and his image comes to my mind. I see his picture on the pillow in my bedroom, and I try to imagine what it felt like to touch his fur and scratch his belly. Although he died more than 4 months ago, to me it feels like it happened yesterday. The hardest part for me has been to realize that I will never see my Petey Pea again. I would give up so much just to hold him one more time or be able to spend one more day with him. Since Petey's passing I have adopted another dog. Although I wanted another Chihuahua, I realized that getting the same breed would make comparisons to Petey almost impossible not to do. Instead I got a female JackChi. She has helped fill the hole in my heart that Petey left. I am bonding with her and realize that she is what I needed.

""There is a slight gas leak under the sidewalk in front of your property,"" he said. ""We discovered it May 31st. A crew will come do the repair around July 15th."" My eyebrow went up. He saw it, and added, ""it's a very, very small leak, so it's ok to wait. We use a machine that can detect parts per million. Yours is something like 5 parts per million."" Should I trust them? This gas company was the one responsible for the San Bruno explosion in 2010, and also the Northern California wildfires last year. This company is bankrupt and owes something like $20 billion. Maybe they are being more proactive now in looking for leaks to avoid more lawsuits. But should I trust them? What option do I have? I'm no expert. July 15th was a long time to wait. Would I get blown up if Fourth Of July fireworks set off the gas? No, no, he assured me. This guy seemed to know what he was doing. Ok, I'll wait. The following week the little colored flags were planted to mark the gas lines, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV line, and water pipe, very colorful to match the American flags on Independence Day. Tick tock. Tick tock. Nerves were just beneath the surface. Finally the day came, and they showed up in force with several huge trucks with digging equipment. It took them from 8:30 am till 8 pm to plug the leak. Sigh of relief all around.",3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCTQ7QWW,,0.0

We loved and cared for a rescue dog who we named Lilly. She was the bright light that shined in our home every single day. She had charisma and truly brought my family together. Although death comes with life, we did not expect her life to end so abruptly. We noticed her struggling the breathe, but we didn't think much of it. Quite possible she may have had a cold or maybe she was struggling with allergies. It turned out that it was much more. Lilly suffered from a tumor on her heart and mucous that surrounded her lungs. We knew the results were unfavorable, but we didn't quite understand the severity. It was almost impossible to wrap our heads around. This seemingly healthy, happy, and beautiful dog was ill and right before our eyes we couldn't even grasp it. Within a week it was determined that to allow her the tiniest amount of suffering possible we would have to put her to sleep. It crushed us. It crushed me. I had never dealt with loss so abruptly and with something I cared so much about. I think about her every day and I know that her spirit still lives on.",,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHFW305M,0.0

Many years ago a girl opened her heart to me, she told me things she said she had never told another soul, she felt that she could trust me more so than any other person in her life. She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever. I heard it first, that magical laugh that always captivated me. I had to seek the source of the sound. Although many years had passed, I could remember it like it was yesterday and so many feelings came flooding back.  When I turned around I discovered it was her - it was really her! She was standing there a huge smile on her lips. It look me by surprise I never thought I would see her again and yet there was was standing before me. We talked for hours as though we had never been apart. To find out that she is moving back to our town, that she is single and still thinks of me as I had thought of her is almost a stroke of magic. I look forward to the years to come and hope they are just as magical as the very first day I laid eyes upon her.",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK6ZSY1L,0.0

We use to date when we lived in the same city but now there is a a few hundred miles in between us. I've missed him so I wanted to take a quick weekend trip just to hang out. I ended up staying at his place on the beach which was amazing. Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months.  I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together. If it's meant to be then it will all work out.",,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,0.0

Most years the vacation is a real grind. We have been going to the same place for twenty years with the exception of two years. The truth is for a couple of years I have been trying to back out of it and do something on my own with my vacation time but my mom can do one hell of a passive aggressive guilt trip to get me to go. My parent will ask me and my siblings what we want to do new this year at the destination but the truth is as far as activities go we've gone scorched earth over this place. Anyway, My dad and older sister normally have the trip scheduled down to the minute, leaving no room for anybody else to have much input. I am a little ashamed to admit for the past few years I've spent most of my time in varying degrees of drunken stupor as my main form of entertainment.  I had thought this might be the year that the cycle would break but my sister, who definitely drives the engine in this scenario, came up with a scenario to take my brother's children along this year. I have to admit, this was not her worst idea. My brother had moved to a different city and these children had never been to the destination before and would definitely shake up the routine. So, that was what happened a couple of month's ago my brother brought his children to town and we packed them into the cars a few days later for the trip. The car ride down was mostly unmemorable except for the fact that I realized that my spotify  playlists were not really kid friendly. The trip itself was a lot of the same things as before but there was a new energy because it was it was new to the children and it was exciting for them to go someplace that they had never been before. Things that had been stale were given new life and people were forced to change up some of their routines. Doing things that had become pedestrian and had lost their luster became fun again as I watched my nieces do them and remembered how I used to love to do these things when I was younger. For some reason I was dominating games that required coordination. Actually, one of the biggest problems was as the week progressed was that time was becoming compressed and there was so much to do. These kids had heard about the different things, those of us who had been coming for years had done, and wanted to do it all. Our last night there we were doing things until one in the morning.

It was nice seeing my friend finally get married. She was really excited to see how her and her partner would continue life together in marriage. She wanted to own a home and have children. I remember going to the event I wasnt a participant but I did get to experience it with everyone involved. After the ceremony it was time for the reception. It was really enjoyable to interact with everyone, getting to dance and eat food. I had a ball dancing, we all did. I even met someone who I really liked there and we hit it off. When the event was over everyone gave their goodbyes. From there I spoke with my friend one last time and then I went home.",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1F9PV,0.0

I joined because I wanted to get into better shape. It was also very close to where I live. He was there the third time I went. I don't think I'd seen him since I moved out 10 years ago, and hadn't thought about where him or anyone else moved to. I just kind of forgot. We talked and actually seemed to get along well. He looked pretty happy and wanted to know if I was new to the gym. I told him that I was. After that, we talked for a while. I'm surprised that he was so nice since my memories of them aren't the best. Mom never had anything good to say about them after I left. The family didn't get along well. As far as I know most of them moved out of the area. Definitely strange to bump into someone I didn't expect to see, but I'm happy I did and happy that he seems to be doing well. It definitely doesn't feel good when you meet people from your past and things go poorly.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8D8FF14K,0.0

I got a nice raise and I feel I also have more prestige in the company.  I also feel I have a lot more responsibility, which is something that I like.  I am now in charge of my group's decision making.  We all get along well, so this is a group effort.  Once in awhile we have a little disagreement, but usually thinks go quite smoothly.  Last week we had to come together to consider what kind of advertisement campaign we will come up with for an important client.  We had so many creative ideas!  It was exciting to see what everyone brought to the table.  After a few meetings, we honed it down to four choices.  We looked at all the positives and negatives of the ideas.  Ultimately, I had to make the final decision on this project.  We presented it to my boss.  It went very well and he was pleased that we did such a great job.

I really think I put my foot down with this issue. The boyfriend and our relationship. I told her that I absolutely would not help her bail him out. I let her know, in no uncertain terms, that I won't risk my money on a guy I don't really like, and I couldn't count on him to show up to his court date. Hell, she can't count on him to show up to a regular date with her, so how can he be trusted? She was really pissed off with me, and told me what a terrible friend I was. That's when I lost it. I told her that she may think what she wants of me, but her opinion no longer matters to me. I let her know I am sick of her endless complaining about her job, her family, her boyfriend, and basically life in general. I suggested she get counseling for her issues so she has an non involved party who can help her sort our her problems. I have been there for her since we were in high school, but honestly, I think she's doing drugs or something. She's been a nut job, with a terrible temper for the past couple of years, and I can't deal with it anymore. I really did mean she should seek help, it wasn't just me saying something ugly, although she seemed to take it that way. A big first step would be if that jerk of a boyfriend staying in jail, and quit bringing her down to his level. She needs to get some of her old confidence back. I told her that I do care about her, but I simply can't hang out with her until she gets some real help. That was when she hung up on me, and I haven't heard from her since. I hope I don't get a call to bail her out of jail.",,37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3Q2E7V1,0.0

We weren't going to stay in Seattle, but really get out in the wilderness for this vacation. So we drove out to Washington and made our way out into the back country. We wanted to first go hiking and camping at Olympic National park. We were hoping the weather would be nice and that we wouldn't have any trouble. The weather did turn out nice and we made our way hiking into the park. There were many interesting paths around the park and we got to see many amazing sites. The mountains, forests, streams and odd bit of wildlife all added to how awed we were by it all. We were having such a good time, instead of moving off toward other parks, we spent an extra day at the park. Once we had packed up our camping gear we went on with the rest of the trip. We left to do the other half of our trip plan, which was mostly driving and exploring. We drive around the state seeing all that we could see and remaining floored by the beauty. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain during this part of our trip, but we powered through. We wish that we could have had more time out there, but we had to come home. It ended up being one of our best trips.",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WK1U9MW,0.0

We had been leading up to this event for a long time. She became very nervous. At night she would tell me that she didn't want to go to kindergarten.  I think her nervousness came from our nervousness. She is our first born, and this was a monumental event in her life. She had gone to preschool, but this felt very different. We tried to do things to make her more excited.  we took her shopping for back-to-school clothes. She did get a little excited about that. We also had an informal event at the school, so she got a chance to look at the school and the things in the classroom. I made sure to take the day off, so that I could help take her to school and be there when she got home.  we got to the classroom, and she found it in and seemed to be having a great time. Before we even got to the school, we took a lot of pictures of her. We took pictures of her on our porch, and pictures of her in front of the school. It was very moving to see her so grown up and ready to go to school. After school that day, she came home. She came through the door and threw her arms up in the air and told us that she loved kindergarten. It was so relieving to know that she had had a good time. In some ways it was more moving hearing how excited she was about the day, then it had been watching her leave to go to kindergarten. In either event, it was a very moving day for me and my wife.",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9HBSK06A,0.0

We had talked about getting married, and we had gone to pick out my engagement ring together, but I didn't know when the actual proposal was going to happen. So I was kind of existing in limbo, just waiting for something to happen! We were on vacation in Florida and had gone out for a really nice dinner together, to an Italian restaurant. I remember having gnocchi but I'm not sure what Justin got. I was wearing my favorite black dress and the weather was beautiful. We split a serving of tiramisu for dessert. When we got back to our hotel, Justin suggested we take a nighttime walk on the beach -- it was really beautiful on the water, there was a breeze blowing over the waves, and all the stars were out. There were, by coincidence, fireworks going on across the water. I remember having my head on Justin's shoulder and his arm around my waist as we watched the fireworks. We were being quiet and then he said something like, ""We have a pretty good thing going, don't we?"" I said yes and was feeling very content and happy. Honestly I wasn't expecting the proposal to come right then, but he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was grinning like a fool and my heart was going like gangbusters. He took the ring box out of his pocket and opened it to show me, then took the ring out of the box and put it on my finger. Of course I said yes, and then he asked if he could get up because there were rocks on the beach and he was hurting his knees! He got up, hugged me, and picked me up and twirled me around. We shared a kiss and then walked back inside because it was getting cooler. We decided not to tell anyone else until the morning so it could be our secret just for the night. When we told our parents and families, everyone was so happy -- they could see how suited we were for each other. We had also each been engaged (but not married) once before so everyone was glad that we had gotten it right this time around. Now we are planning the wedding and adjusting to our lives as an engaged couple!",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGMZPFZ5,0.0

It was her right leg to be exact. She would occasionally brush it off and blame the fact that she was getting older as the cause. This went on for a few months. One morning when she woke up and got out of bed I noticed she was limping. I asked if she was okay and she explained that her leg was hurting worse than ever. I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life. All in all this was a miserable experience.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIW5CLF6,0.0

I had a DNA test done and one of my mother's sibling come as as only being half related to me. I then discovered that my grandmother had relations with someone else. I was not expecting this at all. My grandmother never alluded to such a thing. I doubt she even knew for sure that my mom was not my thought-to-be grandfather's. He died when my mother was about 5. My mother knew of a man that she saw around her house when she was young that my grandmother had relations with. It was from that provided identity that I explored the tree's of some of my closest DNA connections. I found the same surname of the man in a few of their trees. This lead to me figure that he must be my grandfather. I connected with one of my closest DNA relatives to ask some questions. He also did not know who his grandfather is, and we suspect that his grandfather is my mother's father. His father discovered that his father was no who he always though it was after he took one. The man we believe we are both related to died in 1993 and had no children with any of his wives, so there really isn't anyone to test against to receive an answer of absolute certainty. I am pretty sure the man my mom identified is my grandfather as well as his. We are currently working on figuring this out. He is genetically my half cousin I believe. That is my best guess from the amount of DNA we share. I am trying to help the other guy confirm who his grandfather is. I think it is the same as mine, but he thinks it could be him or his brother.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBEQ5PN0,0.0

I was out doing my usual grocery shopping at Raley's; picking up some items for a weekend of watching sports. While in the snack aisle I caught a glimpse of a familiar looking woman walk by. We awkwardly looked at each other for a moment trying to figure out if we were correct about each other. It was Jessica, a woman that I had dated years ago until she had to move out of the state for work. We hadn't seen each other since then so it was a shock to find her in my neighborhood. We had a quick conversation in the store and we got caught up on our lives a bit and she said she moved back to help care for her sick father. When I found out she was single I took a chance and invited her out on a date the next night and she agreed. We went to a movie and saw a new romantic comedy that she heard was good and we enjoyed it. Afterwards we stopped at an Italian restaurant and had a great conversation and things felt like she had never left. We went back to my apartment after dinner for a couple of drinks. We got comfortable on the couch and I put on The Boys since she mentioned that she wanted to see it during dinner. We were both asleep before the first episode ended though. She woke me up early and said she had to go but we made plans for another date soon. It was the best evening I have had since the last one I spent with her and I am looking forward to many more like it.",,33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQ2IKBH2,0.0

Fast forward to four years in college, it was her graduation party. I attended the party with one of our other friends as she was someone we loved so much and very proud of. Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance. I knew it was set to be a glamorous graduation party. I thought she was just going to give a vote of thanks when she picked up the mic. It was more than what I thought as she started talking about her ordeal in college and how she scaled through. She started by thanking God and her parents, the school, faculty and friends. As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey. I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on. I was moved to tears while she talked about me.

He worked at an electronic shop as a sales representative so he did not make enough money yet he spends much more than he earns. It was that bad that i sometimes began to imagine how Jennifer managed to put up with all of his excesses .The most devastating problem about Nathan was that he was a chronic womanizer. In the course of there relationship he has cheated on Jennifer more than seven times, the ones i can still remember or would i say the ones he was caught and could not deny them. Jennifer was sometimes traumatized and always caught in an emotional blackmail. She suffered a lot during the six years of there relationship. I could not understand why she keeps condoling his act of cheating on her. So one day she cried and came to me to complain about how Nathan has just cheated on her i was so mad at her, Nathan and her entire relationship that i screamed at her attempting to give a  piece of my mind. I asked her what she was doing with that good for nothing man, she told me she loved him so much and that she has tried to stop loving him but cannot. the more she tries the more the love increases and how she can not live without him . In frustration i told her to leave my house and that i did not want to hear about Nathan and her relationship with him ever again. both after two years their relationship was still on. Nathan had apologized to her and she forgave him as always and there were back together. Nathan got some religion into his life, he is now a christian. Jennifer told me how everything about Nathan has tremendously changed. I saw the joy i hadn't seen in her for a long time i was happy for her. I was so shocked one morning when she told me that Nathan proposed and she accepted and she would want me to be her maid of honor on her wedding day i was honored to do it and so i was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding.

She just got married a week ago. It was a great wedding they rented out a building that was big and beautiful. It was like a big log cabin but not exactly. They had good music and great food. It was fun socializing with everyone. Until the actual wedding started they thanked everyone for being there and had great speeches. When they finally said their vows and did the ring and everything it was perfect and beautiful. The after party was especially memorable for me we had so much fun. We drank a lot and danced so much it was great. Overall just a great wedding really enjoyed it. I will be remembering it for a long time. I suppose the best thing was how sweet they were to each other. They were so cute and made for each other. I wish my wedding had been half as amazing. I hope to do something this fun again.,,3DR23U6WE60FP77Q9MME6R3ZG6EETV,0.0

We heard a lot about the place and the nature friendliness there. We got there and being summer it was hot there. There was a lot of rivers around, making the breeze cool and convenient.  It was August and this time there were various activities going on there. We participated and made merry with them.

It’s officially my due date! A few days ago, I went to the hospital with horrible contractions. They sent me home because I was only 1cm dilated. I’ve been in so much pain, I haven’t slept for around 48 hours. It hurt to sit, hurt to lay down, I’ve basically been standing up on my feet for 2 days. I haven’t eaten either. My bladder was irritated and just stopped working. I couldn’t pee no matter how hard I tried. I was truly the most miserable I’ve ever been. I finally couldn’t stand it anymore so my mom and boyfriend took me back to the hospital and I FINALLY got admitted!! :D I guess all those crazy contractions worked because I finally dilated to 3cm and they admitted me! (After threatening their lives if they didn’t lol) so here I am, on my due date, CRAZY happy with my epidural, and waiting to progress. Right now I’m about 5-6cm. Can’t wait to meet my little boy! UPDATE: My son was born 7/29 at 2:49am. 5 lbs 9oz We’re in post partum recovery, I ended up having a c-section due to meconium in his amniotic fluid. He is perfect, healthy, and we’re learning breastfeeding together. He’s my angel.",,317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZSCQNI2,0.0

The reason it was so memorable was for starters it caused a fight within my family.  Since my mother is sick and my father is the primary caregiver I had to ask my siblings if they would take care of her for a week while I took my father on the trip. They weren't happy about this. It caused a big argument.  In the end they agreed.  We set a date for my father and boyfriend to pack up and head 8 hours north with my father's fishing boat which he hadn't taken out in years.  My father is 80 years old.  He grew up in WI and misses trips tremendously. It made me feel goo inside to take him.  You never know when it may be their last. We spent the trip fishing, telling stories, visiting old friends and eating as much as we could.  Lake time was super important so we made sure to get up early and spend a lot of time fishing the lake.  Although we didn't catch a lot of fish due to the time of year, we still have a great time.  It was well worth it to see that big grin on my father's face.  In the end everyone pitched in to give a really nice memorable gift to my father.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IXDYQ1X,0.0

That was my real blood father. Take into account he lives about four states away and time that has passed between visits was around six years. Now just because we live far apart doesn't mean we don't have a good relationship, we do it's just that while I was little he had to move away so he could make money to live. I didn't understand this at the time but as I am a adult now I understand this more than ever. What helped me understand this more was the fact that I now have kids myself and I get that you always do what is best to provide for them. So with the background that we have I was so happy and elated to finally see him again after all these years. Now don't get me wrong on another front I also have an amazing step father that helped my mother raise me when I was a young boy and I love just as much, so I am truly blessed on two fronts.  As the party passed and the day went on with lots of fun and happiness, I started to grow sad because I felt he would have to leave that night. He told me he was staying the weekend and actually planned a fishing trip with my step father also. I was so excited for this as I knew I would have the two most important men in my life for the whole weekend and fishing on top of that. I think to myself this is going to be the best weekend in almost six years for me personally.  So after this party we head out and pick up supplies for the trip and also picked up bait and such as well. So after arriving we set up camp and then cooked out and just sat and talked among us. To be honest the best part was that he included my step dad and they also bonded as well. I honestly don't think I could have asked for a better weekend that that, and to share it with two people that care about me was the icing on the cake.

He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married. This was definitely the most romantic thing my boyfriend has ever done for me.,,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q,0.0

The ride here was absolutely grueling. An entire day long drive. He gave me such short notice, so I had to basically tell my work I'm not even coming in.

I was really going for that shiny new promotion to get that corner office with the view, but no. Now half my co-workers are going to hate me, as I'm sure my boss is going to try splitting up all my work among the rest of everyone. Lisa from accounting will be cross with me, and I was really feeling like we were becoming friends. I can't be really too selfish, though. The reason we were called down, which he failed to mention to me on our day-long journey here, is that his dad is sick. One look at him, and I knew it wasn't good. My husband broke down the first night there. Told me he was afraid to lose his dad. I shouldn't be so selfish, and should let him stay with his dad in his final days.

His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.",,3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,0.0

It upset me because I had just had my hours cut a my job and was trying to get caught up on some bills. I really did not have the funds to buy a new tire. So I looked online at how much a new tire would cost and if I could maybe afford a used tire or find a place that would let me make payments. I found an affordable new tire, but they said I would have to pay the 100 dollars up front, and I just did not have it. The mechanic said that they had some used tires that were much cheaper, but I would have to come in and look at them to decide which one to buy. I thanked him and hung up. I then realized I had no way to get to the shop to buy the tire! I then called my good friend, Joe and told him about my situation. He said he would be glad to help and that he would be over in about twenty minutes. I was relieved that he could do it, because if he couldn't I would have to find another way to get there. Twenty minutes passed and he hadn't arrived yet, so I decided to wait a few more minutes before I started to wonder if he was really going to show or not. Right before I was going to call to see where he was at, he came driving down the street and pulled into my driveway. He got out of the car smiling and said ""Sorry, I can't drive you to the shop to buy a new tire..."" I looked at him and frowned and asked him ""Then why did you drive over here?"" we just smiled some more as he walked around to his trunk and opened it. ""Because I already bought you a new tire!"" I just stood there flabbergasted. I could have hugged him. That helped me out terribly. I thanked him profusely and told him I would pay him back when I could and he told me not to worry too much about it, just to remember that I owe him a favor. I am lucky to have such good friends.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1JTMAG,0.0

I flew into MSP early on a Sunday morning via a red-eye flight.  It was nice not to deal with so many people and I was able to sleep through part of it, so the day wasn't ruined.  My friend Mike from college picked me up and we went downtown for breakfast.  He and I chilled at his apartment and caught up for a few hours until the afternoon.  We met up with some of his friends in the city and saw a UFC headline match.  I decided to put money on some of the fights and got lucky.  It was foolish but hey, I was there to have fun and it wouldn't have cost much more to lose anyway.  I ended up winning about $50.  We hit up a couple bars afterward and had a nice time.  I wandered around a bit over the next couple days.  I didn't have much of an itinerary and it was nice not to have anything in particular to do until the weekend.  I spent almost a whole day at The Mall of America - it was huge, even larger than I was expecting it to be.  I went to see The Specials on Thursday as part of their 40th anniversary tour.  I like ska, and I don't listen to it much at home, but the show was fun and the music sounded pretty good in person, so I enjoyed myself.  On Friday and again on Saturday I met up with family outside the city.  It was a reunion party and we were able to spend it outside in the sun both days.  I played a lot of horseshoes and frisbee.

It was few months back she went to the hospital to get a check up and had tests run.  The results came back and she learned that it was inoperable and she had short time to live. In the short time she had left. She decided to make a charity for the children of the neighborhood.

I have an oddly shaped uterus that has a wall down the middle, separating it into two chambers. This condition causes my babies to run out of room quicker than usual and there will always be a chance of them coming early. This was the case for both of my kids. Recently I gave birth to my second son and he was much bigger than my first which resulted in him coming much earlier. He had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first few weeks of his life and it was very sad and exhausting. He was too small to nurse directly at the breast so I had to pump milk every 3 hours, day and night. I had to stay at the hospital in his room if I wanted to be able to hold him at his ""touch times"" so I was getting, at most, 1.5 hours of sleep at a time, for nearly 3 weeks. The level of sleep deprivation a human body can handle is truly insane. I met some amazing people that also had babies in the NICU. It's really cool to see all the different family dynamics. There was a huge Amish family that had a baby there as well. I got to ask some questions I had always wanted answers to. It was a cool experience even though my memory is very foggy, probably due to the sleep deprivation. I am so incredibly grateful for the amazing NICU staff for accommodating me in every way possible.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5QJEI1,0.0

It has been a long sad process although this fate has been in the cards for quite some time now.  She was an alcoholic for most of her adult life and things had gotten quite bad over the past several years.  She disappeared and was out of touch for the past five years or so, we'd only hear where she was if she ended up in rehab, jail or the hospital. Last March I get a phone call that she is in the ICU and has only a short amount of time to live. I try to get back to see her but am unable to for a couple months.  This lead to a trip home in May and I wasn't even sure if I would get to see her. She happened to be back in the hospital the day after I landed and I was able to go in for a visit. This would be the last time I'd ever get to see my sister. She was so different and sick and completely ruined. She had been an brilliant young woman, beautiful  and could have had anything but she fell victim to a lack of family support and the harms of drugs and alcohol. I admit that I have had my own struggles throughout my life and often have thought about my sister while trying to straighten myself out, even long before she passed away.  She passed away one month ago to the day and it has been life-changing in many many ways, I'm trying to be better everyday so that I can find a way to honor her and not let her death be in vain.  I want to be able to help others that find themselves lonely and lost, like she often was. There is much that I need to learn and a lot of growth that I need, the loss is still fresh and I often find myself confused about how I'm feeling lately. All I know is that I'm changed and I won't let her memory be lost.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0B824X,0.0

She lives around 3 hours away due to school so we always plan and get together when possible. For this trip we decided to check out the local Hibachi grill for dinner then go peruse the carnival that just so happened to be in town this weekend.  When she arrived, I couldn't help but give her the biggest bear hug since it had been so long since our last meet. We decided that we would try a new Hibachi place that had opened up in town for dinner. When we were seated, we got paired with a group of people who were celebrating a birthday. Everyone was jovial and incredibly friendly. Our grill chef was also such a pleasure. Everything was going great, he was flipping shrimp and making the flames almost lick the ceiling. We stared in awe as he balanced an egg on his cooking flat. Unfortunately he made a mistake while doing his flare. Poor guy ended up tossing an egg, and instead of catching it; it landed flat on his head and broke open. There was egg all over him!! It was hard not to laugh at this guy's misfortune but he took it like a champ. After a brief recess he was back at it to finish up our dinner. When our bellies were nice and full we headed off to the carnival. There were lights and rides and games everywhere. My friend even won me a giant teddy to keep as a memory of the night. To end the evening we rode the Ferris Wheel. Looking at the city lights twinkle against the night sky was awe inspiring. I will never forget the time we had together and we are already planning our next trip!",,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEI1JEO1I,0.0

My step father, a very healthy man most of his life, was suddenly struck ill with a possible stroke. As a family, we've always been close. We generally know when one or another is sick or feeling bad. He had exhibited signs and symptoms, but we could not get him to respond or go to the Doctor. It really upset us that we could not get him to go. His stubbornness initially made us mad, but we got past that. He was just too ill to feel mad at during this dire situation. Upon visiting the doctor at the ER, he was diagnosed with a Subdural Hematoma. A Subdural Hematoma is what doctors refer to as a traumatic brain injury - which is in effect a collection of blood between the covering of the brain. It is very serious and can lead to death or disabilities if left untreated.  The Doctor will usually put you on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin if your body is able to respond. Fortunately for our family, he got there in the nick of time. He is resting, recuperating, and responding to treatment and prognosis is looking great for a full recovery. We now wonder if his initial stubbornness was the result of the stroke - that is, the symptoms of not fully understanding the seriousness of the matter and deciding against going to the hospital.",,3RGU30DZTBUJNS3YEQWTHTLZPM2JM2,0.0

I had never been on a cruise before so from the time I got to the port I was in complete amazement. Once we were on the ship and did the safety class my family and I went to explore all that we could do on the ship. A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars. Everyone looked at each other in disappointment but agreed that we'd definitely do it all again. I had a lot of fun with my family and was grateful that my cousin decided to celebrate her birthday by going on a cruise.",,3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHPKSE78,0.0

Just as we finally saved enough for a down payment on a new home, we also got hit by one of the worst hurricanes the state has ever seen. Our soon to be new home was flooded! I was shocked and very upset. I can remember the exact moment when we were told by the realtor that the sale may not happen at all. The house would have to be reinspected. I prayed that things would work out. About a week after the original closing date the news came in. We would be able to move in! We were all very happy, especially my son Jimmy. Coincidentally, this was also Jimmy's birthday week. Jimmy was so excited not only about the house, but his birthday. He's always very excited when it comes to this time of year. So this year we decided to do something special. We organized a fourth birthday party and housewarming party all in one! We wanted to share this special time with all our friends and family who were very supportive all along. I can remember the joy on little Jimmy's face that day.

Our anniversary is tomorrow and we're going on a fabulous date of dinner around Newport Harbor. As I reflect back, I think to how nervous I was to even ask her to marry me. I bought the ring five months before I actually asked her. I practiced what I would say for months and just couldn't work up the nerve. Finally, after all that, I popped the question. I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. And she said yes! She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn. We got married just one month later and the most beautiful service ever. We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Everyone was there, our parents, our friends and even Elvis made an apppearance! We stayed the Mirage just up the street and just had the most wonderful time.

Most people rebel in high school, but I was a really good kid. I guess in my early 20s I was tired of being so good, though. I just know that he would always love me. I knew that he would always be there no matter what. To this day, I still feel upset over his death, and the way he died. I will never be able to live the same again.

I moved to live closer to my in laws. I also liked the idea of living in a bigger city, which they do. I was not happy where I lived before. There was little shopping and not much employment opportunity. It was very exciting to come to a new state. It is a warmer climate than what I was used to so. I hope I get used to the heat. Most people that have lived here a while seem to do ok in the heat. I thought it was funny that I needed to use different and new make up and hair products here. The things I used to use just don't work so well here. It has been very energizing for me to be somewhere new. I enjoy going out in the evenings and visiting new places. I have met some people that live nearby and they seem very nice. I have been helpful to my inlaws who really needed some extra help around the house.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMERDMSK,0.0

I am broken. So many questions, no answers. Is it my fault? Why did this happen? All these didn't questions and emotions and I can't decipher them. How did I become the wife of an adulterer. I never thought it would happen to me. I never thought he was the kind of man to do this. I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this. He has asked for forgiveness but given the length of time he has been doing this I feel like its unforgivable. It if had been a bad lapse of judgment a one time thing maybe two, I could possibly forgive that but 2 years. Come on I don't think I can.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6370B,0.0

Till today I still do not understand how to go on living life. I mean what do you do when you realize you have no control over the most important things in life. What is next after something that drastic happens to you? is the question I have been asking. It all began with a small illness, until she fainted and I had to rush her to the emergency room. I thought it had to be stress, as we just moved in to our new house and she was the chief decorator. After she regained consciousness, they ran some test. After the test we had a chat with the doctor. The doctor said he could not really tell us what was going on and we were directed to see a specialist. We met with the specialist and he said he would have to run some test. After the test came the news, the doctor said he suspect it might be cancer. I was shocked and said he had to run some more test to confirm. He made us stay over night to carry out the tests. After the test came the confirmation, they discovered a tumor in her breast. I was so lost, still lost, but there is still hope.",,31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDRUNI50,0.0
