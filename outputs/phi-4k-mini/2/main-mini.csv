He hung up the phone and I barely got the details of his arrest. I rushed over the police station where he was being held to try bailing him out. I called a few friends that would help and our lawyer to meet us up at the station. I drove there as quickly as I could to come to my friend's rescue. When I got there the lawyer had already arrived and was talking to the police. He told me that he had been arrested for possession of illegal drugs and needed 50000 cash bail. He told of how the policemen came knocking on his door one Saturday morning. He was just busy having his breakfast without a worry in the world. The police demanded they search the house. He questioned them on why or what they were looking for and they said drugs. They already had a search warrant so they just went in the house and started searching. When they found the drugs they arrested him and took him to the station. He did not know where the drugs had come from. He wondered who might have told on him.,308Q0PEVB9Z8LX0Y7Z7O060F6NK9IJ,308Q0PEVB9Z8LX0Y7Z7O060F6NK9IJ,0.0

Yikes. I still cringe to this day thinking about what happened three months ago. So Lynn, Eric and I were on the last leg of our road trip. We were heading to Acadia National Park. We were having a good time talking about what podcasts we were listening to lately. I mentioned that I started listening to a new true crime podcast. It piqued Eric's interest, so of course he turned around from the front passenger seat trying to get to his phone to pull up the podcast. Lynn was driving and was taken aback by a grown man trying to get to his bag like he was still a kid. It all happened so quickly. I tried to tell Eric that I would grab his phone, and to sit back down. But no he 's up already, and almost had it. That's when Lynn decided to pinch him on the rear end. All hell broke loose. Eric didn't expect it and rolled on his side. Too bad it was the driver's side. Lynn lost control of the car for a moment and we began to swerve towards the trees. Then she regained control. For that moment, all I could think about us crashing into the trees and my parents. Lynn pulled over to steady her nerves and to see if we were okay. We were fine physically but had the one of the biggest scares in our life. Moments later a police car pulled up to check if we were okay. He told us about a diner on one of the exits that we could sit down and recollect ourselves. We thanked him and detoured to the diner. It was still morning so we had plenty of time to get to Acadia National Park.",,3018Q3ZVOJCZJFDMPSFXATCQG1OARN,0.0

Every few years at least. I was in a small tourist town in Thailand right by Pattaya Beach. I was out fairly late one evening and decided to just roam around the city and take some pictures of the citizens there, the shops, nightclubs etc. I found myself in a rather secluded and dingy part of the city and wasn't sure exactly how to get back to my hotel. I was looking for one of the motorbike taxis but didn't see any. While I was looking around there was a group of Thais, probably in her early 20s and I could tell that they were part of a gang or something like that. I thought for sure I was going to get robbed or beat up or both. They were just across the small street giving me the eye and all of a sudden a taxi went by and I waved at him frantically. He saw me and drove over to where I was at and pick me up. I got back to my hotel safely but I was pretty shaken because I knew things were going to go badly if that small gang caught up with me. I was in that city for another two weeks and I still ventured out and about but I tried to be a lot more careful about what parts I ventured into. I really should have known better as I have been to quite a few other countries and have been in cities that were not very safe. Even though I'm somewhat used to being in these types of environments, they can still be very scary. Tourists have been known to disappear and never show up again. This happens fairly often, especially in countries that have a completely corrupt police force. I still travel but I'm a little more careful about what city I go to and where I go in that particular city.",,304SM51WA4QG34IRAVFYVE1SAOBSB3,0.0

It was a lovely wedding– very unlike any wedding I’ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers… never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren’t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin’s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He’s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I’ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn’t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom’s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didn’t go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.",304SM51WA4QG34IRAVFYVE1SAOBSB3,,0.0

I will forever remember it as something sticking and in all honesty, the day I became an adult. Not that I wasn't one already. On that day, I remember I did everything as I would each day prior to work. I ate breakfast, drank my regular cup of coffee with cinnamon sprinkled on top, etc. However, on my way home, I began thinking about an argument I had with my mom a few days prior. I was thinking about how it made me feel and the events that led up to the event. As I parked, I saw that no one was home except my mom. I went ahead and entered my house, and went to grab a snack. As I closed the refrigerator, I saw my mom standing in the hallway. I approached her to speak about the events from the other day. We went back and forth in a very emotional conversation. This was probably one of the most intense conversation I have ever had with my mom. She told me so many things that it made me think twice about how I was behaving towards her. It was the day that I found out my mom did not know how to swim. I HAD NO IDEA. I was honestly so shocked and surprised that I had seen my mom in pools before, but never knew she couldn't swim. How can I not know something so important about my mom?Which made me realize that I only have one mother. I should be paying more attention to her. I should be bonding with her more.

Two baby girls! After a few worrisome doctor visits, we found out one baby was absorbed by the other. While we were very saddened by the loss of one baby, we were ecstatic about the healthy baby girl my wife was carrying. While my wife was nesting in preparation for parenthood, I was reading every baby book I could find! By the time the baby, Ella, was born, we felt we were prepared but we couldn't have been more wrong. No amount of reading can prepare you for the immediate and immense love you feel when you first hold your child. I knew from the moment I looked at those warm brown eyes that I would lay down my life for this child. There is no greater joy than seeing something so perfect and knowing that you are the reason it exists. The first month was the hardest. Adjusting to a new baby in the house, and her sleep/wake schedule while maintaining our own routines was very taxing on our relationship. I'll admit, I could have tried harder. Unfortunately, that's the thing about hindsight, only it is 20/20. While we both love our child very much, and I will always cherish the good times, and bad throughout my wife's pregnancy; we couldn't make our marriage work. We have been separated for three weeks now. I want my family back, but I fear that ship has sank.",,308XBLVESJQ42PIEV6FT54WWN37BRA,0.0

I went to the local appliance store that's near my home. After arriving at the store I looked around a little bit to see what they had. I went to buy a griddle and there was only one left. I reached to put the last one in my cart. There was another lady there that also wanted a griddle. She stole the griddle from my cart. I was really feeling that move from her so I took it right back. I didn't think things would get that serious over a griddle. After getting the griddle back I browsed around the store a little bit more. I did find a few more things that I ended up grabbing to use. Things that would compliment my new griddle. So finally I went to the cashier to check out. I was finally ready to leave the store. I accomplished what I had came to the store for.

My journey was a long a tedious one because some of the apps did not work or just did not help with the learning process as much.

I can't believe it!  I CAN SPEAK SPANISH!  After the encounter I had a few months ago with that family in the car wreck, I am so glad that that language barrier is gone.  I really felt so hopeless when I was trying to talk with that Spanish speaking family to ensure everyone was ok and reassure them that help was on the way.  Of course I would be the first person on the scene and probably the one person in the area that did not know any Spanish!  I was relieved that the police and fire department showed up so quick.  I was so desperate for help and unable to effectively communicate with the family inside the car still that I literally felt sick.  I am so glad my friend told me about the duo lingo app shortly after the incident.  I downloaded the app almost immediately and was very surprised at how easy it was to start learning another language.  It did not take long before I had a basic understanding of the language.  Shortly after that I could follow along in a conversation and eventually I felt comfortable enough to start answering back in Spanish.  Although I hope to never find myself in that same situation again, at least I'll be prepared to help if it were to happen again.

It was when my boyfriend and I drove to Florida and went to the Florida Keys. We went snorkeling and this was the first time both of us had ever done this. It was memorable because of how amazing the experience was being somewhere completely new doing an activity and viewing things in a new way that we hadn't experienced before. And we got to do it together. It barely cost us any money and we got to have a great experience. The most surprising part of the whole ordeal was that I wasn't scared to go out deep into the ocean. I felt healthy and good about myself and the fact that I accomplished something that for myself was a big feat even if other people might not see it as a big deal. I had been very nervous to do this. We viewed sea creatures such as a few fish, a giant crab, and other smaller little crabs. There wasn't very many fish which I was surprised about but the experience was still interesting. I saw the way the sea worked and all of its components that make it the ecosystem it is today. I also realized how hot the sun is down there because we both got very burnt on our backs from them being exposed to the sun for a few hours. The time went by faster than I can ever remember and it was my most memorable experience this year. We want to go back but have no idea when. I believe next time we would like to do a type of tour instead of just swimming aimlessly about and we hope to do it again soon.",,30BUDKLTXEHD45W08Q4G3BXL04DE5R,0.0

I swear I spent five days awake, sitting in the rocking chair next to her bed, singing in her ear, saying prayers, talking to her, telling her dad was waiting for her.

After so many years of hard work, sleepless nights, working over the weekends, working more than 40 hours per week, after my college degree and certifications that I took in school I got promoted at work! My Manager ask me if we can have a quick meeting today to discuss some personal projects about my development here at work, and at the beginning of the meeting everything went smoothly, we were talking about new projects that were coming up and how I was doing in my current role. Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title. At that moment I was shaking and feeling anxious because this is an important moment of my life, and that I know that I have the potential to do more here in the company. After I signed those papers I tell thank you to my boss for this amazing opportunity of advancement in my career and I will never let him down in my new position. He said congratulations you deserve it, and I want to see more awesome things here at work. Then I left his office and I immediately called my wife and tell her the notice of my promotion and she was so happy because it is a new chapter for our life, with our new baby and kid, more money for the family and a bright future here in the company. It is a very emotional moment for me and my family, that I will never forget. After that I called my dad and mom to tell them the notice of my promotion here at work, my mom was all happy and she was telling how smart I'm and to be thankful with God for every step that I do at my career here at work. In the other hand my dad was kind of surprised, but he told me to shot for the top, keep fighting for your dreams and keep fighting for your family, because at the end they are all depending in your salary/money for a place to live, pay rent, groceries, entertainment. But at the end I know that he was happy but he wants me to see like in a Director/Managerial position, he always tells me that I have a lot of potential and that I'm very smart in whatever I do. Then after talking with my dad and mom, I give the surprise to my mom and father in law, they were so happy and pride that I got that promotion, because they know how much did I suffer to get that promotion and they gave me their best wishes and blessing to my family and always to look forward of new opportunities wherever I go.",,30H4UDGLT34F936W931DEP7B965PMM,0.0

We decided to go to the really nice one with recliners and good food. This was an extra 20 minute drive. We saw the movie, had a blast, and were on our way home. About 10 minutes on our way back, we heard beeping behind us from multiple cars. We thought someone was just doing something stupid or accidentally hit someone. 2 seconds later, BOOM, the loudest crash I had ever heard combined with the hardest impact I ever felt in my life happened. Before I knew it, my head hit the passenger side air bag and my brother was screaming. I remember hearing tons more beeping and then people screaming. I checked on my brother and his head has bleeding a bit, but that was it., surprisingly. After we both realized we were ok, we got out. There were bystanders yelling at the driver who hit us. Some other people came over to us and, after making sure we were ok, told us the guy was obviously drunk. My brother was enraged and so was I. People had already called the cops.

Looking at it from my angle there wasn't a choice in the matter. Staying there was damaging my relationship with my kids. It wasn't getting her or I anywhere good.  The kids were not getting along at all and her children were unparentable.  We are so different in how we see parenting and how we parent that it wasn't crossing over at all. And every time I tried to help she would undermine what I was doing. She is the prototypical helicopter mom, saving her kids at every junction. but then they just learn they can do what ever they want. But my girlfriend still thought we should live together. Even though her middle child was in juvenile detention for the majority of the year and was coming back. We both agreed that she needed to get him out of the town we were living in and that my son and her's should live together. But still blames me for breaking up our unit.

It seemed like we were stuck in a rut. Then, we both remembered an online friend we had met via social media. Although we had never met in person before, we decided to meet up with them after this budding online relationship. My wife suggested that we go downtown for dinner and drinks. I messaged the person, and they said they'd love to join. Actually, it seemed like they were too enthusiastic about the meetup. This led to some high anxiety on my part, since I tend to be skeptical. I asked myself questions like ""Is this invitation socially acceptable?"" and ""Why is this person so eager to meet us?"". Luckily, my wife was able to talk out the doubt and reduce my apprehension toward the situation. So, we got ready, my wife being a little late as usual, and took a taxi downtown to meet our new friend. As we arrived to the restaurant, our new friend and us both got out of the taxis at the same time, so we had a good laugh. From then on, the night seemed to go rather smoothly. We talked about our lives and our interests, and there seemed to be a real friendship budding. After a few drinks, we decided to call it a night and exchanged more contact information. We decided that we'll see each other in a few weeks. Overall, it was great. I'm so glad my wife calmed me down. In the process, we gained a new friend and reignited our social life.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1Z1SX0B,0.0

We don't have a ton of money to spend on vacation, so any little trip is a big deal for us. Also we totally suck at planning things, and hadn't done anything all summer, until we really buckled down and started making a cohesive plan. We splurged and got a hotel near the park for two nights, and invited a friend of ours from Tennessee to come stay with us too. His name was Nick, and we'd never met him.	That is to say, we met him on Twitch. Karl and I started streaming a little over a year ago, and while I got bored of it fairly quickly, he kept at it and ended up starting a small group of streamers. Nick was one of the first members added to the group, all of us fans of the game Dropmix (a strange music/card game hybrid). In the months that followed we would all become closer watching each others stream at different times of the day, keeping each other company at work and so on. So when we invited him to stay with us, we felt like we knew him.	I would describe myself as having a high degree of social anxiety. I had some hesitation about meeting someone in real life who only knew me from my online persona.	But it ended up being awesome! Karl, Nick, and myself all share a love of roller coasters in addition to weird card games, and surprisingly none of us had ever been to Kentucky Kingdom before. The lines were short and they offered free soda to visitors from out of town (I won't say no!), the rides were awesome, and the people-watching was on point. The only drawback to the whole thing was that Nick and Karl both snore. But I'd had enough to drink each night that it wasn't much of an issue. I ended up feeling glad that we rallied and planned a trip, however quaint. It's something more people should try. Even just a few days away with friends made the stressful reality of day to day life a little more tolerable.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1Z1SX0B,0.0

Through talking with the admission officers and touring students, we captured a lot of information about admission policy, documents need to be prepared, majors, and student campus life. It was very helpful for my child to select ones they are interested in and would pursue their studies in the future. It is is very important to touch these necessary information early prior to their application deadlines. We drove to a few cities nearby where the universities we are interested in located. We visited 2 schools each day during this trip. We first visited a few schools on the east coast, then visited others on the southwest side. A few Ivy leagues schools were included into this trip. According to the well known rule, we divided these schools into three categories, reach, match, and safe to schedule our visit concentrations. For a reach school, we focused on to learn more about the admission policy. For a match or safe school, we concentrated on the required documents including SAT test scores. During the visit, we figured out which major could be more promising one when applying for a reach school, considering as a premed track student later on. For a match or safe school, we strictly followed up the most interested major such as Biomedical engineering in one engineering school. We compared the similar ranks of schools in terms of student population size, campus life, major strength, faculty to student ratio etc. We finally narrowed down to 10 schools in our list. One of things need to mentioned especially here: be sure to check in on time prior to your information session. For example, WashU treated a campus visiting as the demonstrated interesting of a student on them. Some of schools followed up us after our campus visiting. It is also useful for a family to on-site check the student residence and meal plan in one specific school. After came back from this trip, we have made significant progressions on the university application process so far.",30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPOFBQHD,,0.0

Muscles that weren't cramping up now seizing up because of my more awkward and desperate movements to stay afloat.  Taking on water, choking, vision becoming spotty.  I remember blacking out on the surface, my mind overwhelmed with panic.  But then I remember falling into a comfortable embrace of nothingness.  It was so eternally peaceful.  I thought to myself, ""this is it"", I am dead.  But I felt a presence echo through me, so deeply that my whole body shook.  It said one thing only - ""NO"".   I woke up a day later in the hospital.  I was told I was saved by another surfer who saw me drowning.  Even after 26 months I still dream about it, the drowning, the acceptance of death, and the...something else out there.  The divine something telling me ""no.""  It's not your time.  I feel truly blessed and protected.  I now search for the reason why I was saved by god.  There must be a reason why I was pulled back.",,30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2CGXA0ZW,0.0

My kids are ready going to their college in next a few year. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. We directly contacted with the teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events. We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized tests more earlier. He have made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manors instead of non-focused ways. Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as accept rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future. In summary, this trip was a very important for us to help the kids to prepare their college application in the coming years.",30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPOFBQHD,,0.0

I wanted to have the most perfect wedding with my fiance. This didn't quite happen the way we wanted, and there was a few things that dampened our spirits. Let me start by mentioning the worst part first. Most couples want a perfect wedding but I am sure that doesn't always happen. Here is what happened to us. My wedding morning started off terrible. It was not the best as far as weather goes. There was rain coming down, and thundering. Not only that but started at the same time as my ceremony, I mean exactly! That caused everyone to bring the chairs, and everything else including the food indoors. Then we waited til the storm left until we started it again. We dragged everything outside again instead of just having the wedding indoors. The greatest thing about it is that we saw a rainbow during the time of the marriage vows we exchanged, eventually. This sometimes means an old friend or relative who has passed is looking down upon us in heaven and smiling. That made me happy too.",,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFOOU9JT,0.0

We found a house with more bedrooms quickly, and the whole process was as smooth as it could have been. However, it is bittersweet looking back on everything. That house was very special to me. I did a lot of work on it. I saw my children grow and learn and love there. We made so many good memories. We charted how our children grew on a closet door (which is probably still there). It was a wonderful house while it lasted, but things happen and we had to let it go. As of today, I can still remember every little nook and cranny of that place. After all, it has only been a few months. However, it is sad to think these memories will eventually fade.

We had been engaged for almost 9 months, and I had been stressfully planning for the last 9 months. The day before the wedding started off stressful. We had an issue at the rehearsal dinner with our Officiant complaining and not being very supportive of all of the changing circumstances. He made me so mad because he was making the day all about him and how it wasn't easy for him, but it's our big day! I finally snapped, then went outside with my maid of honor to calm down. He finally apologized, then we went home to rest before the big day! The day of the wedding I woke up early because I couldn't sleep from excitement! I went to breakfast and met my bridesmaids and mother there. I could barely eat, but managed to have a biscuit and some eggs. We then went to the salon and it took almost four hours to get all of our hair and makeup done. We had a delicious Thai lunch, which was perfect, because that's some of my favorite food. We then got ready and headed over the venue. It was so crazy hot, so I was standing in front of the fan and putting my feet in ice water to try to stay cool! We got out photos done, behind schedule, but finally it was time to hide inside for the ceremony. People started arriving, but right at the time the ceremony was supposed to start, we had a huge thunderstorm! My husband had to run around getting everyone to help bring chairs inside. Luckily, the weather cleared shortly and we were able to get everything set up again and the ceremony started. It was beautiful, with a rainbow overhead and the bright sun coming out. Overall, it was a very special day and I'm so happy to be married now!",30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFOOU9JT,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFOOU9JT,0.0

It was a western which is outside of my normal book choices.  It was titled ""Lonesome Dove"" and was written by Larry McMurtry.   ""Lonesome Dove"" is the name of a near ghost town in south Texas.  The two main characters are Gus and McCall.  They are aging ex-Texas Rangers that decide to go on one last adventure.  They decide to steal some cattle from Mexico and start a ranch in the northern U.S.  I think it as Montana.  The book had very rich character development.  There were good guys, bad guys, and in-between guys.  On of the major villains is the a really bad guy name ""Blue Duck"".  One of the in-between is a girl/woman named Lori.  She is a ""lady of the night"" but sweet just the same.  Gus and McCall are kind of the good guys.  The scenery and imagery are very rich.  It is very colorful in terms of the language.  You need to remember this book and maybe get other books written by McMurtry.  I really miss this book -- it seemed like an old friend.",30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,,0.0

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book.  As such the others paled in comparison.",30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,0.0

This day which was actually May 16, 2019, was one of the best days of my life for several reasons. Number one, I worked extremely hard to my patient studies to make sure that I graduated in only five years which a lot of people do not do. Because I was able to accomplish this in such a short time, I was extremely proud of myself and I felt that this was one of the greatest accomplishments of my life. I spent many nights in many weekends working extremely hard in the laboratory doing homework’s studying and doing very difficult experiments just to make sure that I had all of the data necessary to graduate. My family and I had to make a lot of sacrifices  during my five years to make sure that I was going to graduate and finish my degree. My family and I knew that this would be a long-term investment so we put all of our resources into it. On that day I feel like I finally had accomplished everything that I want it and I was going to be able to get back to my family. This is why that day was so so significantly memorable for me. I felt that I had to finally achieved one of my major life goals and my family and I were actually together getting this PhD just myself. Today or still remember that day like it was yesterday was a day that I’m going to remember for the rest of my life. It is a day that will live on in our family and something that will actually carry-on to other generations inspire other dinner .I am the first one in my family to obtain an advanced degree and because of this I know that future generations will actually  no that anything is possible. I am looking to inspire future generations of my family and I know that it all starts with my graduation. That PhD degree is going to take me anywhere I want to my career which is why I am so happy that I’ll site able to finish it. I am looking to make a big difference in our world and I know that my degree in my education will allow me to do just that. I don’t see work that’s just work but I want to have a job that I can have fun and make a really big impact in the scientific world. I now have the opportunity because of this day and this is why this is my entry into one of the most memorable moments of my life especially in the last six months.",317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZIFNINQ,317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZIFNINQ,0.0

My mother told me not to take her car as it wasn't ready for the road we didn't listen. Me and my boyfriend and my two brothers were all stuffed in this sedan with our new puppy. We made our way down the highway about 40 miles (It was a 180 mile trip) when my boyfriend points out the heat gauge is going up. Shortly after that the car begins to stall. This is where everything takes a turn. We pull off to the side of the highway in order to check the car. It turns out to be a radiator problem and with no towns for 20 miles in any direction were in trouble. So we are all sitting in the car trying to avoid the heat when we notice ""has anyone see the puppy?"". This is when things get even worse we couldn't find our puppy we thought she might of ran off into the everglades to the right of us so we start going in the mud looking around. We called her name shaked a box of treats and still can't find her. Then my brother in the car calls us all over and low and behold there's the puppy. She was hiding in between the seats and the trunk to stay cool and somehow she found her way in a spot where none of us could see her! This brings up our moral while we wait for triple a that my grandma had called for us. In the end we never did get to go on that trip with the puppy but we all made it out okay and for what it was it's a memorable little road trip for us.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMRJOASD,0.0

She was a gift for my seven year old son from his father, he cleared it with me first whether he could get the cat as we already have two.  I initially was going to say no, but then he told me that it was a Rag Doll kitty, and I had read a lot about how awesome that breed of cat is. The fact that it was a pure bred cat changed my mind as to whether we should get it.  My first two cats are rescues, from a kill shelter and from a vet's office, I told myself I had saved two already and I can give this one a good home too. I told him yes, then we had to almost a month for her to be ready to come to our house.  When my ex finally brought her over I had no idea how quickly I would fall in love with her.  She's the cutest, fluffiest, little kitty ever, and her personality is so easy to like.  She's sweet and cuddly, purrs as soon as you touch her or pick her up, and she looks so happy to be pet. She's also super playful, pick up a toy and she comes running and pounces on it, her favorite toys have feathers on them. She runs and jumps through the air so comically that you can't help but laugh at her antics.  She's made a huge impact in my home, the other two kitties have been very accepting of her, after the first day hissings.  I love my first two cats to pieces, but neither one of them is a lap kitty.  New kitty loves to curl up on my lap and be pet.  It makes me so happy to have a kitty that likes to snuggle and be close.  I'm very happy that I now have three cats in my home, so is my son, as he likes to say he's a crazy cat boy.",30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A,30ZX6P7VF9HTGOZ548D92K71IIJJ2A,0.0

I took an uber to the train station in Downtown Denver and then the train to the airport. I was several hours early, but I had to wait forever because there were so many people flying that day. It took about 2 hours to get through TSA and to my terminal. I then tried everything I could to stay calm until my plane. It was delayed by a couple of hours and we didn't end up flying until around 9PM. I landed at 11AM, and was ecstatic to see my girlfriend. We got my luggage and left.

This job also required a special certification which I did not possess. I applied anyways. Two weeks later I got an email from the company requesting a time to set up a phone screening. I passed the  phone screening and got an interview. I was not able to prepare for the interview much, and expected to bomb it. I was nervous and unorganized before the interview and decided to just wing it. I did the interview. The questions were hard, but I think I did a good job answering most of them. There were a couple of questions that I think I messed upon. At the end of the interview, I was hired on the spot. I couldn't believe it! I thanked the interviewer and completed the paperwork for new employees. I never got a job so easily. It made me believe more in myself and what I had to offer.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYE00OV0,0.0

I haven't written here in a while because I've been preoccupied with my illness, but it seems like it's completely gone!  And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.  Now it's the ninth week and I haven't had one yet.  I may put on a little weight from eating so much cheese, but I'd rather be chubby than in agonizing pain from migraine headaches.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLYQNKVOD,0.0

We had a very small wedding with only our children and my grandparents attending.  George has two daughters that are five and eight.  And, I have one daughter that is eight and one son who is four.  My son Ryan is a very active and curious little boy.  We were married in a gazebo at a park.  The park was filled beautiful gardens and a lake with a water feature in the middle.  Our wedding day was on a beautiful summer day.  During the ceremony the local ducks decided to join us.  The ducks made a mess on the floor of the gazebo.  As we were saying our vows, Ryan noticed the ducks and decided to check them out.  He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were.  As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes.  By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake.  When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks.  By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake.  George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan.  But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake.  To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake.  Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely.  After all the drama, we went back to the Gazabo and continued saying our vows.  Our wedding day was a good day overall although, it was not what I expected.",,31EUONYN2WPGEQO48VPPCLLY7GNOVC,0.0

We saw the Hollywood sign, the walk of fame or whatever its called, and had In-N-Out burger for the first time. After we ate, we drove to a place that was recommended by the locals to do some clothes shopping. All along the way, there were hoards of homeless people. We knew CA had a homeless crisis, but were not expecting this. Anyway, we ended up having a tire blow out on the way to a mall. Embarrassingly, I had never changed a tire before. I got out to call someone for help when a scruffy, old homeless man stopped to help. He was the nicest man and I felt so bad for him. He changed the tire in just a couple minutes and didn't ask for money. I gave him 20 dollars, though, because who wouldn't? Nobody else stopped and offered assistance before he came.

It was a big road trip because my family, my parents and my sister's family were all going together and this was a rare occasion. My sister's husband usually doesn't want to drive to another state but we finally convinced him and he said yes. The weather was nice and even a little cold for me. We visited The White house, Lincoln Memorial, Smithsonian museum, JFK memorial and the Capitol during our trip to Washington DC. My parents told me that it was a  dream comes true because they have never imagined that they can go there in their lifetime and see those famous places. Our next destination was Philadelphia and although this was ""less"" special, we had a great time there. We had amazing Indonesian food, just like what we had back in our country. It was so... so.. good! We met with an old friend before heading to our next destination which was New York. We went to The Statue of Liberty, Times Square and China Town. We bought the red bus ticket so we can hop on and hop off easily. The boys certainly didn't want to drive there because the road was a mess and so crazy. We spent most of our time on the bus and listened to the history of New York. It was sad to go home but we had a lot of fun. We got home safely despite of a little incident of our old minivan. Suddenly the steering wheel was becoming heavy and made a squeaking noise. The noise became louder when we were almost home but we made it safely.  I guess even the car got tired. We spent more than $2000 just to fix it. The trip was worth it and I can't wait for another family trip.",31HQ4X3T3TWSGD43184S9HXXLV6SLW,,0.0

It's been a long time since I've seen her so sad. She had recently finished speaking to Aunt Rue in New Jersey on the phone when I noticed how low her mood was. When I asked, she told me she had just learned really disturbing news. According to Aunt Rue, my cousin Deena -- who is my mother's and aunt's niece -- has apparently joined what other family members described as a ""cult."" We don't live in the same state and visit close to never, so it's not surprising that all of us up East were a bit suspicious of the claims. We thought the family Down South was exaggerating the situation... that is, until we went down to see for ourselves. Shockingly, we soon learned, they were not stretching the truth in the least. Deena, always a husky if not somewhat fat person, had lost so much weight we could barely recognize her. Her house, always pristine and inviting, was now a veritable dump with stuff just thrown haphazardly everywhere. The saddest part was that she seemed oblivious to how all of this looked to other people. Months later we still have not figured out how to get through to Deena.  She has resisted every attempt to break through her wall and help her understand how dangerous and unhealthy her predicament is. The family Down South continues to monitor her as closely as possible while attempting to not appear like they are stalking her, which makes her defensive, angry and argumentative. Meanwhile, the rest of us are seeking professional advice because it has become increasingly certain that we cannot get through to her on our own. Sad, perplexing situation all around.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO,,0.0

It takes place during the time in which I live in Hawaii. I was homeless for 9 years in Hawaii because of the president during that time was trying to extort money from military families to fund his campaign about going to war against another country. I remember when I was 8 years old, seeing the Sheriff at our front door saying that we were going to be escorted out of our government house due to the fact that we were unable to make $3000. 00 within the week to give them. At the time I didn't know what this meant because I was so young. After we began to move out of our house, Reality began to make sense and the danger of the unknown future was beginning to weigh down upon the center of my consciousness. I grew up homeless, loosing everything that I ever owned over a weekend changed the way that I think and see things. I grew up in homeless shelters, living in the back of a car with my brother, sister, and mother who was at the time very frustrated with the way things were going, I didn't blame her. My mom never made good decisions afterwards. She picked the wrong people to trust and those people always took advantage of us. Those who were supposed to be apart of the Christian society are the most wicked people I have ever lived with. Taking the little money we had and abusing my mom in front of me makes me want to hunt them down and treat them in a similar way. I will not forgive them, nor forget them. Years have passed now, My mom is dead. She died on the Fourth of July. She endured all of that abuse just to die a few years later. I am alone now. I have no real family left. I am attending Job Corps which I am now hearing are being shut down throughout the country by another man that says he does it for the ""Good of the Country"". I have no bad feelings towards the present president, but I hope that he doesn't make another decision like the past president that will affect so many in the most unfortunate ways. They say America is the greatest country, I don't see that any more. Its the greediest.",,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP8Q3ON,0.0

My fiance's mom wanted to come visit us that weekend but we had already had plans to go to this festival. She decided that she would come with us as well. It was so hot outside, in the upper 80s. The event was outdoors, on the streets, with no respite from the sun. This made it challenging for vendors to keep their cheeses cold and stocked. The event drew a bigger crowd than they had imagined. Many vendors started selling out of their most popular items within the first few hours.  We found a small cafe that had a table available after being told that it would be over an hour wait at the location we originally planned to eat at. We quickly realized why the cafe was so empty. The food was like something they would serve at Fyre Festival. The Caesar salad was just a few pieces of lettuce and dressing. We could complain, but we were just so relieved to be inside and out of the heat. Later, we found humor in the conditions of the food we ordered. This is a found memory for me because I do not often get to spend time with my future mother in law, so it was nice to have time to bond.",31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP7UO3A,31JLPPHS2VGW2HMLOLJJTQTFP7UO3A,0.0

It seems that cousin Deena is now a full-fledged member of an actual cult. I NEVER would have seen this coming when I was just an innocent kid who used to go Down South each summer and stay with her over other nearby relatives because she was so kind to me. Although it's been decades, I remember her taking me to the movies (thanks for introducing me to Burt Reynolds and making ""Smokey and the Bandit"" one of my all-time nostalgia faves), amusement parks (NOTE: avoid falling down in a pit of animal poo when at the zoo) and our annual family reunion barbecue. This was before her child was born, so it was just me and her for the most part when we weren't out and about. Those were the days -- miss 'em indeed. Now her child is grown and she looks like an anorexic, bug-eyed, stressed-out version of her old dour, well-fed self. She has literally lost dozens of pounds and is so skinny, the entire family is afraid severe weight loss will end her before any other medical problem can. I first found out about the cult she joined from relatives who, unlike me, talk to her fairly regularly. We went to see her in person this summer because of increasing concerns about her state of mind, and were we in for a shock. Her formerly well-kept home, which she has owned for years, was a complete mess, like a hurricane flew through it several times over. SHE was a complete mess, too. It was so sad to see her but not recognize the random ramblings about her new group of ""friends."" Unfortunately, we did not get to meet any of them, so there were no confrontations with the people dragging her down. Our only hope is that eventually we will be able to stage a successful intervention to help her reclaim her life. I hope and wish with all my heart that we will not be too late.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO,31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZVWPNJO,0.0

Perris is 2 hours away from us so we actually went and stayed with a friend on Friday that lived one hour away from the lake. On Saturday was the start of our camping trip.  It was hot, 105 plus degree temperatures everyday, trust me I will never forget that.  Good thing the lake was not too far from the campsite. We went with 5 of our friends.  The best thing was my child got to to see one of her friends that she had not seen over a year because they  moved four hours away.  I had a great time.  The lake was nice and refreshing. We had a couple of canoes with us so we went out exploring the lake.  We had great food from the grill and fresh fruits to keep us fresh because of the heat. The last night, on Sunday there was a storm off in the distance. We had a great lighting storm and a little wind. Luckily, it did not rain.  I know now not to go camping here in the late summer because the heat was too much for me, I had mixed feeling from this camping trip because I was happy to be around some great friends I had not seen in while but the heat was awful.",31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZWXMNJO,31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZWXMNJO,0.0

But we do get together with friends because we like them so much. Our friends are avid campers and invited us to go with them over the weekend in the middle of summer. Of course we accepted and we looked at each other when we got home and wondered what supplies we might need. We had no idea what to bring nor what to expect. So we did the best we could considering we didn't even have sleeping bags much less a tent. We arrived at the campsite where our friends were already. The place was serene and had a good atmosphere but the heat was unbearablly hot. There was no place to hide from the heat. We didn't move much during the day at all and hoping that the sun would go down quicker than usual. We took short hikes around the campground just to see what type of facilities were there. Not much in the form of relief from the heat. Well the sun finally went down and then we had to deal with the mosquitoes. I hate mosquitoes. Fortunately we did bring insect repellant and our friends saw that we were a bit frustrated about the whole thing. Our friends started a bonfire and that was wonderful. That took away the mosquitoes and was warming the coolness of the night. We drank beer and told stories of our past and then had a good time from that point on. I am glad it lasted only two days because I just am not cut out to be a big time camper like my friends. Me and my wife were surprised at the empathy that our friends took on us. I felt that they had been in the same position when they first started out camping as well. Me and my wife learned a lot about ourselves and our friends during that lost weekend of our lives. We cherish our friends even more now and next time will be prepared to tackle the campsite.,,31LM9EDVOMEP5AOYQRBTU8AZWXMNJO,0.0

My friend is not the most romantic type of guy.  I wanted him to have a special moment with his girlfriend so I went along with it.  I told him I'd look into it at night when I was off of work.  We collaborated via chat from then on out to look for the perfect scenario.  We decided that a romantic dinner on the beach would be perfect for them.  I even got to add more details to help him out since he was drawing a blank.  I suggested that there be a live band playing some romantic songs as well so it wasn't awkward silence when he got down on one knee.  He really liked that idea.  He's kind of an awkward guy at heart.  We planned it out until we had all the details perfectly planned.  We even had a little runthrough a few hours before he was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him.  I recorded the whole thing because his girlfriend would definitely get a kick out of it.  It was finally time for the big moment and I had to wait a few hours before he texted me that she had said yes!  He had sent me a picture of her wearing the engagement ring in the exact spot we had planned.  It was so fulfilling to help out a guy I've known for years.",,31QTRG6Q2UZF3KVAS6PO8KUI8DLPYY,0.0

On our first day we decided to stay together and went snorkeling with, then had sex with, two lovely couples. After that we would alternate in staying together and searching for our own fun. We both had a number of wonderful encounters and met many new friends. There was never any pressure and boundaries were strictly adhered to. When we were together, we had a safe word to use if either of us felt uncomfortable. It as a bi friendly resort, so we were free to express our full sexuality.

He just kept saying ""okay that's fine"" over and over like he was expecting this conversation. It felt a bit odd. Then he casually dropped the bomb that he had been seeing somebody else, and I lost it. I ripped into him with every swear word imaginable for a few minutes. I honestly can't believe he didn't hang up the phone. Then I pretty much told him what a pile of crap he was and hung up on him.

My name is Dale, I was just diagnosed with stage 3 lung cancer. I am 58 years old, married happily to my wife, Angie, of 27 years. We have one daughter together, who is 26. Her name is Christina. Four years ago after graduating college, Christina moved away to peruse her career. Unfortunately, moving half way across the country took a toll on my wife. Now that I have been diagnosed with cancer, my wife is struggling even more. After finding out, during a phone call with my daughter, I asked her if she would be willing to move back closer to home, at least temporary, to provide support and be there for her mother.  Two weeks ago, I learned that she has requested a leave from her job, and is renting the house next door to us for the next couple of months. Hearing that, was a sign of relief. Having Christina here the past couple of weeks has been so helpful, Chemotherapy is taking a toll on me, I don't have as much energy to do the things I did before. I am so grateful for my wife and daughter, I can only hope I make it through this and am able to live until I am old, wrinkly, and white haired with Angie. And that I am able to walk Christina down the aisle, and watch her raise a family. Until next time Diary.  Dale.",,31T4R4OBOT2DUBQ50SDIB7BEXYSC7Z,0.0

We had been dating for about 6 months prior to the breakup. Everything was going okay enough, but recently we had started fighting more often and his communication skills left something to be desired. I remember I told him that we needed to talk, and asked him to give me a call when he got done with work. I sat in my car in the Target parking lot waiting for his call for a couple hours. I like to have difficult conversations in my car, because it feels intimate, but then I have the option to drive and clear my head. My stomach dropped when my music cut out and saw his name on the phone screen. We small talked for a few minutes, and the conversation felt strained/off on both our sides. I finally let him know the reason I wanted to talk is because I just couldn't do this anymore. I had spent so much time recently being unhappy and emotional, and I didn't see a pathway out of that for us. There was a lot of silence and ""I wasn't expecting this"". He acknowledged that he hadn't been listening to what I told him I wanted and needed, so he was beating himself up and blaming himself. We both cried, a lot on the call. I tried to reassure him that I respected him and didn't have any bad feelings toward him, it's just a relationship wasn't working for us. He was so kind and had so many nice things to say to me, that in that moment I wondered if I was doing the right thing. The whole conversation was so emotional and I'll never forget hanging up that phone, and feeling a weight being lifted off me. I did the right thing, for both of us.",,31T4R4OBOT2DUBQ50SDIB7BE5VY7C2,0.0

She would eat, but was not able to gain weight. I envied her ability because I could look at a donut and gain ten pounds. However, she was eating a lot, but was still losing weight. One day, we decided to bring my wife into the emergency room as she had fainting spells. When we arrived, she was diagnosed with a chronic autoimmune disease. That explains why she wasn't able to gain any weight. We always assumed it was her fast metabolism. The fainting spell was a blessing in disguise because it is a common symptom of this autoimmune disease. The doctor who diagnosed her has already scheduled outpatient services for my wife, and as long as she can manage her symptoms, she should be able to live a full life without any setbacks. Although this is disappointing, it will allow my wife to be more disciplined about her health and wellness. Truthfully, she has always been good about her health and wellness. I, on the other hand, have not been. I am hoping that her malaise motivates me to improve my health and wellness. I used to not care what I put into my body, but after this experience, I may start doing that in order to have longevity.",,31UV0MXWNRYPKAYM49U7OQVDRUNI50,0.0

My daughter and her new roommate were happy to finally meet each other.  The whole day went by so fast.  When it was time to say goodbye, I tried to put on a happy face.  In the end, I could not help being emotional. What I remembered the most about that day is what my daughter did for us.  She had parting gifts for all of us.  She wrote each of us a letter.

He really wanted to go away for his day but we just didn't see it being financially possible. Somehow, my husband and I managed to get our funds in order and we were able to take the family to Disney. He was so excited. And to top it all off, he even got to eat at Cinderella's castle on the morning of his birthday. I am not sure who was more thrilled- him or I! We got to go to quite a few Disney parks and do some cool things. In Disney Springs we went on a hot hair balloon which was really neat! We also went to dinner and afterwards went on a vintage car ride in the water. It lasts about 20 minutes but it was quite unique to say the least. Some new things like Disney's new Toy Story land were a big hit. It was our first time there since they added all of that. The slinky dog ride was awesome and worth the VERY long wait.  I definitely won't forget this day and I know he won't either. Putting a smile on my child's face just means the world to me. I am so happy we were able to go. Not only for his birthday, but also to finally take a much needed family vacation. It's been quite awhile since we moved and I had to start working more hours.

I have lost so much respect for so many people, and gained that respect for others. I have lost the love of my life, only to have them come back into my life.

But recently things have gotten better after their return, I feel much better as of late. Things are starting to improve as I grow with this person and begin to trust them again. It's very hard to go through losing someone so vital to your life. I never thought I would see them again, nor hear from them again. And that was mentally challenging thing ever. Knowing they knew the most about me, and how to help when I was mentally gone was harsh. I didn't know what to do without them. They taught me coping mechanisms and how to handle myself. Being alone during that time lead me down a very dark path. I relapsed in a lot of things I shouldn't have, and I think that's one of my biggest regrets.

I had just finished my last year of school, in a brand new area since my father had us move for work. I was really sad about a friend I had, because she said she was moving away the day that school ended. I was so distraught I couldn't bring myself to say anything to her, since it was too painful for me to remember how I would never see her again. I ended up bolting out of my last class and heading to the local market, where I bought a maple bar and coffee. Maple bars and coffee ended up being a ritual of sorts for me after that day. I bought a 20 dollar store card at that same market and redeemed it for a video game, which I played for an hour before breaking down in tears. I wished at the time things were different, that I didn't have her leave my life. I was certain, at least at the time, that I had met someone very special to me. Fast forward a couple of years, and I no longer speak to her. Part of me wishes that I kept in touch, but I realize now that people have to move one. No matter how painful or uncomfortable it may be. I still drink coffee and eat donuts from time to time, but I've stopped for the most part. I try to be healthier, even if it seems like it is an effort that goes unnoticed. I wish her the best.",,323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLBGF4HFF,0.0

My cousin is 3 days younger than me and we celebrated our birthdays together. I remember that we went to our favorite park and invited lots of friends and lots of family. We had two grills cooking lots of burgers, hot dogs, different meats like steak, sausage and ribs. We all ate and laughed and played water guns, and water balloons.  I got a new nintendo switch that day and so did my cousin, with the same game. The new pokemon game that came out that year. It was trully special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally gotten it. We played for hours and even had to take a break.  I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We trully felt like we shared those moments. We caught pokemon that was different then eachothers and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played agianst eachother. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower level pokemons. Me and my cousins are some big time fans of pokemon. The people at the party thought we were ridiculous for playing games like this but this makes us happy!",323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLB7HQFHU,,0.0

We have three kids and they were all staying with my wife. I was alone so I got me a 6 pack of beer and started drinking them. I didn't know that one of the caps on my beer was off and when I got up it split and went everywhere I was furious about the situations. But I tried to control myself I just got me another beer and drank on it. My life was not competently over it was just very dramatic for me. I will not of now one let the cap of my beer fall off and not look to make sure ts still there. My wife face times me and I told her about my story and she laughed but really I didn't think it was that funny I was crying. She had the kids face timing me to and there were laughing to. I was bored after a little whial without the kids and my wife being at the house. It was very quite and a little to quite at moments. But the next day I ended up staying the night with them and then the kids came home with me after that day. We ate spaghetti and meatball that night and watched a movie and just hung out with the family. But after that my wife got her peace time but she got bored after a whial and lolly I think she missed just the kids. but she says she missed me to. We love watching the dog because that is more money but being away from family is hard. My wife and my children are my world and I don't know what I would do without them. We have some great times and some not so great times but I wouldn't change it for the world. It was nice having a little break from all the notice. But also it was a lot quieter. Thanks for readying my story and I hope if you have children and a wife you cherish every moment with them.,,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DP4F70C,0.0

It was not your typical honeymoon, we spent our honeymoon acting like kids, and it was great. We spent a large majority of our time riding our favorite rides, and just pretending we were children again. We decided on our first honeymoon trip was  going to Six Flags in Atlanta, Georgia, since it was where we had our first date. We rode almost all of the rides, and re-lived our first date. After Six flags, we went to Disney world in Orlando, Florida. It was our first time there, and we were a bit overwhelmed with all of the rides and activities there, but we had a great time. While in Orlando, we stumbled upon another theme park, which was a water park. To be honest, we had more fun at the water park than we did at Orlando, we were there for hours! Our next and last trip was in Chattanooga Tennessee, where we stumbled upon two other theme parks. One was definitely one of the smallest ones we have been to, but it had a lot of charm to it. The last one we went to, was a very massive one, almost the size of the Disney world one in Orlando. I think our last theme park was the best one. The rides were fantastic. The food was amazing. The prices were reasonable. After it was all said and done, we were very happy with our decisions and had a fantastic time.",,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DUP1072,0.0

I am broken. So many questions, no answers. Is it my fault? Why did this happen? All these didn't questions and emotions and I can't decipher them. How did I become the wife of an adulterer. I never thought it would happen to me. I never thought he was the kind of man to do this. I guess we all think this way though until it happens to us. The thing that hurts the most though is not just the fact that he has committed adultery but the length of time that its been going on. I guess looking back I should have known but I never questioned his late nights. I never questioned those weekends away. I trusted him wholeheartedly. I think now I just feel so foolish. Did he ever laugh at me knowing what he was doing behind my back. That thought hurts so much too. I am trying to come to terms with all this.

I never planned to go to graduation. I said I was getting out and never ever looking back. It costs money just to travel there and have the outfit. And I don't like it there nor do I like the people. I look back on my time there as struggle and pain. But I looked at Facebook the morning of graduation and there was a small pain. Seeing two of my almost friends in their caps and gowns, with their families made me slightly sad for what I didn't have. Finishing didn't feel like a celebration and maybe had I gone I could have made it be one. They had been through struggles similar to mine and they were there, in the gowns, celebrating. I could have gone and seen them off, and gave that university and city where I spent so many years of my life a proper goodbye. So I sat there, looking at Facebook, thinking about how the last time I left I didn't know it was going to be the last time. I realized that part of why I hadn't wanted to go was because most of my friends had graduated years before and I wasn't really close to anyone else. Dragging them back for my graduation wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. And I realized that somewhere deep inside I had seen myself being dragged into graduation, begrudgingly going. But people had listened when I said no. Facebook, ignoring privacy as usual, alerted one of my almost friends I was online. She sent me message asking where I was and if we could meet to take photos together. When I told her I was not there she expressed disappointment. She wrote me a message about how sad it was to not see me as she saw me as directly responsible for her even making it to graduation. At the same time, other almost friends who had graduated previously were online congratulating the two. Upon seeing I was online, they wrote to me as well. One expressed congratulations to me and spoke of how she was glad I was finally free. The other spoke of how we would celebrate in the future, as I had celebrated her graduation with her and she could not have gotten through without me. And I told myself that I didn't need to be at that graduation because I had what I needed from it--the people who understood how much it took and the feeling of being free of it.",,323Q6SJS8J2HQCGR43PVAQLBQ8OFHT,0.0

I come from a very large family (I'm the youngest of 7) and there were 10 of us total who attended the concert.  It was an awesome show and I would rate it as one of the top 6 or 7 concerts I have ever attended - and I have attended a LOT.  It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason.  My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.  He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife.  She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.  Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert.  She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.  She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.  She passed away that night.  We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.  My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away.  He said it just didn't feel right.  After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go.  His oldest son took her place.  It was an emotional evening while we were at the concert but it was exactly what our family needed.  We miss her terribly - and we will always miss her terribly - and the concert was dedicated to her.",324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G,324G5B4FB4UT0JVPOCKYG69DW6870G,0.0

It was so fun when she moved in and we immediately were friends! She has also introduced me to a lot of people since I am not from here. One of the people will be getting me a job soon. College is a lot more expensive then I thought so I NEED a job right now! I haven't felt homesick yet! Last year I was for months and months. Maybe having a best friend as a roommate helps. She keeps me busy! We do have a break coming up soon so I get to go home to see my family for a couple weeks. I really should start saving up for that. Time to get back to studying.

One person in particular was someone who really loved to play jokes on people and tease them. I have so many memories of them in particular picking on me. It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected. As an adult, I know now that he was just a jokester and someone who loved pranks and joking around but as a kid, I saw it as torment and a bully. Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid. Some things latch on to you no matter what and being ""picked on"" for me was one of them.  As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a  regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless. It was a good case of when you are a kid, you can't understand anything. I felt a whole lot better after the situation. We ended up having a great talk about everything and I forgave him.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD38PDEC,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD38PDEC,0.0

It was a wonderful and relaxing trip for both of us. We flew to Miami and then a short flight to the Bahamas.  We took a taxi to the huge hotel we were staying at. On the way, I could see a lighthouse and clear blue water. We both felt so good to be there. The weather was perfect with a warm breeze and full sun! After getting our room near the pool and beach area, we went straight away and got lunch and walked around the area. It had many restaurants, gambling areas, pools, beaches, water sports, shopping, exercise rooms, massage rooms and dinner entertainment! Everyday we had things to do and see.  There were many memorable things I did there, like going down a huge slide with my husband behind me at once. Getting my hair braided on the white sand with two lovely lady with a drink in my hand having interesting conversation. I was fun to pick out beads for my hair. I think one of the most memorable was when my husband took me to the Columbia Emerald store and helped me pick out a ring I like for a memory of the trip. It is a beautiful emerald ring in gold with an oval shaped emerald in the middle and smaller ones on both sides. Everyday I wear the ring and its makes me so happy to remember all the fun times we had there.  Needless to say we want to go back.  Its a great place to visit and relax.

I felt like my boss hated me and it seems like she lets other coworkers get away with a lot more stuff than me. All of my bills are late, my pay check barely covers my bills.  I started the car and started driving, I was going to go drive my car off the make out hill. I got to the top of the hill and my phone rang. My moms picture was staring at me. I knew I couldn’t leave her, she would be devastated if I took my own life. I knew where I could get help, a friend of mine had went to a crisis stabilization unit a few weeks ago because she had started cutting her self again. I googled the address and followed the directions. When I arrived to the parking lot of the init it was a small white building with red and yellow tulips in front. I was ashamed and didn’t want to go in. There was a knock on my car window. I looked up to see a guy in a blue polo shirt looking at me very concerned. I opened the door and he asked if I was alright. I told him I wasn’t and I needed help. He said he would walk me in and help me check in. I was taken into a room and a lady checked that I didn’t have any drugs or weapons. I was given hospital pajamas and told to put them on. All of my personal belongings were taken into the units custody. Soon a psychologist came into give me an evaluation. After I was at this place for seven hours with staff members monitoring me, I was told I could leave if there was someone who would come and get me. I called my mom and she came and picked me up, was so scared she was going to be mad at me, but when she arrived she gave me a huge hug as tears were streaming down her cheeks, she told me she was going to help me with my drinking problem and she loved me.",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDMEDEDW,0.0

I remember eating a lot of lobster and steak on most nights. I would always go to the casino to gamble. I had a fun time in there. I won and lost a bunch but overall I did alright. There were dance nights that were fun. I would dance with other drunk people. I didn't puke but some people did. I went down a slide on one day. It was fun. I also golfed on the ship.

We left out of Seattle, Washington.  We live in New York and had to fly across the country.  It was the first time we were both on an airplane and it was both exciting and nerve-wracking as we were flying in the same day the ship was leaving Seattle.  We arrived at Seattle with no delays and met our transport at the airport.  It was approximately 30 to 45 minute ride to get to the ship.  I'll never forget the sight of the ship - it was so much bigger than I could have imagined.  We had to wait a little while to board the ship and there was not much to do...but finally, we were able to board.  The ship was so large - like a little city.  We found our room, dropped off some stuff and then went to get some food.  They were serving burgers and fries at one of the eateries.  We waited in line, there were a lot of people.  The food was not great but we figured it was due to the number of people being served and they were rushing to serve as many as possible.  The food throughout the cruise was hit and miss...but mostly very good.  At least, if we did not like something, we could go back and get something else.  The cruise was a once in a lifetime experience.  We got to see so much beautiful scenery and we had 4 stops on land.  Glacier Bay was spectacular, a sight I will never forget.  We saw glaciers calving...it was awesome. The trip was an experience I will never forget.",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSGSUI,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSGSUI,0.0

It was the first time on a plane for both of us.  I was a bit nervous as we were flying in on the day of departure so a plane delay could mean missing the trip, but I did have trip insurance.  Luckily, we did not encounter any delays and we arrived in plenty of time.  I had booked a transfer from the airport to the Pier, and the bus driver gave us a tour on the way.  We passed the Space Needle which was awesome! Once at the Pier, we had to wait a bit to board.  When we got on board, we went directly to wait in line to eat.  It had been hours since we had any real food and we were not able to go to our rooms yet.  We walked around a bit and then finally went to our cabin.   Our vacation was finally starting! The days were filled with food, scenery, movies, casinos, shows and some land excursions.  Exploring different parts of the ship kept us very busy.   The most memorable part of the cruise was when we went into Glacier Bay - the scenery was breathtaking!  We saw the glacier break apart into the water a few times, once was a large break.  I took so many pictures but I couldn't fully capture the beauty and awe of the all of the moments. This trip was a once in a lifetime experience...even if I go back, I could never fully experience the magic of the first time - but it would be fun to try!",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSGSUI,,0.0

I was at work wishing I wasn’t. Imagine my surprise when the line shut down and they sent us all home. I thought I’d surprise Linda by showing up home early. I was the one with the surprise of my life. I knew something was up when I walked in. Linda was sitting on the couch and shed obviously been crying. I asked, and she told me she’d been having an affair with our friend Steve. I left on the spot. In hindsight, I should’ve taken Ralphie with me. But I just wanted to get out of there. Instead, she went down to the courts the next day and filed for custody. It took five months to settle this stupid custody mess. And in the meanwhile, I’ve spent my entire savings. $23,000 cash. I think the lawyer might have done me dirtier than my ex in some ways. I’m not sure if I’ll ever recover financially. Thought about ending it a couple times too. I’m glad I talked myself down.

We spent the next two days in the hospital. Nurses and doctors came in and out to check on him and run tests throughout our stay.

We went to DollyWood, SplashCountry, Hatfield and McCoys, Goats on the Roof, and several other local attractions. It was a wonderful family time. One of the most exciting parts of the trip was when my daughter was selected to go up on stage on the Hatfield and McCoys dinner show. She had so much fun getting to dance with everyone on the stage and we even bought the video to bring home so that she could always remember it. It was also my son and daughter's first time riding the coaster at Goats on the Roof. My daughter wasn't tall enough to ride by herself, so I had to ride with her this time. I cannot wait until she is able to do it all on her own, because my son loved it! It was one of his favorite things. My kids also loved our cabin. We had a huge cabin with enough room for my entire family to stay together. The kids loved that it had an indoor pool, hottub, game room, and a theater room! They still talk about their favorite rides at DollyWood. This was my daughter's first time riding a lot of bigger rides, so it took us a little while to talk her onto the roller coasters, but once she tried it she was hooked. Her favorite was the Fire Chaser and she has been begging to get to ride it again. My children enjoyed this trip and cannot wait to go back. We are actually considering going back next month and letting them see all of the lights at Dollywood.",32EYX73OY1VJYORKVXWOAUOKD7YURX,,0.0

I was expecting my immediate family, my grandparents, and a few others since not many family members were in town that I was aware of. However, when I reached the location of the party, I came to realize that it was more of a surprise party for them, and all of my aunts and uncles had traveled to attend! I was shocked to see so many family members there, and they were all excited to see me. With the festivities commenced, I went to go talk to some of my cousins that had all traveled a decent distance to be there. I learned that one of my cousins was going to move closer to my grandparents since they needed more immediate help (my grandpa was struggling with Alzheimer's).  He told me that my grandparents had shown lots of signs of needing help and offered to be a help when a family council was called with all my aunts and uncles. That was definitely a surprisingly development! The party itself was great and well planned. There was a slideshow to help everyone remember all the awesome moments of my grandparents lives and what they had done for the world. They showed that my grandpa used to serve in the marines and would have to leave for long stretches of time to fulfill those assignments. Most surprisingly, they had a scavenger hunt prepared that had some of the littler children go around the house and ""discover"" hidden clues that revealed more about my grandparent's lives. They were thrilled to participate and added to the fun of the party. After all was said and done, the family did a great job of preparing the party and showing my grandparents that they care. There was a lot of work that needed to get done with their advancing age, but it was great to participate and see so many familiar faces.",,32EYX73OY1VJYORKVXWOAUOKBGBURQ,0.0

We weren't going to stay in Seattle, but really get out in the wilderness for this vacation. So we drove out to Washington and made our way out into the back country. We wanted to first go hiking and camping at Olympic National park. We were hoping the weather would be nice and that we wouldn't have any trouble. The weather did turn out nice and we made our way hiking into the park. There were many interesting paths around the park and we got to see many amazing sites. The mountains, forests, streams and odd bit of wildlife all added to how awed we were by it all. We were having such a good time, instead of moving off toward other parks, we spent an extra day at the park. Once we had packed up our camping gear we went on with the rest of the trip. We left to do the other half of our trip plan, which was mostly driving and exploring. We drive around the state seeing all that we could see and remaining floored by the beauty. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain during this part of our trip, but we powered through. We wish that we could have had more time out there, but we had to come home. It ended up being one of our best trips.",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WK1U9MW,0.0

We gathered at the lake in Kentucky where we meet every May.  We spent three days fishing, boating, and socializing.  It was great to hear from old friends who we do not see often anymore.  All of the adults were very close in college, but have drifted apart in the recent years moving to different states. It was important to me because while I enjoy meeting with my two best friends from college, our families have now started to grow closer as well.  Each family has two children, and I enjoyed seeing my daughters become closer friends with the other children.  The children planned their own games, enjoyed swimming in the lake, and created a rope-swing off of the dock.  The most meaningful moments to me were seeing our children develop a similar friendship to what I had with the two other Dads who were present that weekend. The children wanted to keep in contact upon leaving, which has not happened before.  They planned to ""borrow"" phones from their parents so that they could text and call each other throughout the summer.  They even planned another trip for the three families to an amusement part later this fall. The children are now growing old enough that they can experience lake activities without the adults, giving us more time for reflection and fun.  The fact the the weekend hit a milestone birthday for me this year was largely a coincidence, but it worked out perfectly as a time to reflect on four decades and anticipate (hopefully) many more.  It is great ot know that some friendships span multiple generations.",,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM2FMZIGG,0.0

The whole day was full of love, laughter, family, stories, pictures, and great food.  My son stood tall and proud on the stage as he received his diploma and when he saw us in the crowd he smiled just for us. We had a part afterwards and tons of his friends came to see him and give him gifts.  He also had a lot of family in town for the party including people from out of state that hadn't seen him since he was a baby. The only bittersweet thing about the whole day was that his biological father didn't come to see him. That was a tough pill to swallow, but my son made it. And for that I'm always going to be proud. He has his diploma now and can move on to college. He is grown up and I have done my job to get him out into the world.

I'm sure you've seen those roadside attractions where you can have those old-timey type photos taken. You dress up in old clothes. Sometimes you're cops and robbers or sometimes you're barmaids. Things like that. We got the whole family to take on in Western clothes. It was amazing and definitely an experience. I keep the picture on my mantle in a nice frame. It is always nice to look at and remember that trip with everyone. I hope we can do something like that soon again.,,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G36N8KED,0.0

L., his mother, was suffering from some sort of neuro-degenerative disorder that left her confined to a wheelchair with limbs curled into tight knots.  L. was very active in my life during our college years.  She'd have Pat and I over for dinner every month or so.  And I got to know and love her greatly.  L. passed away last month after battling her condition for years.  It was time for her to go, and I'm sure that everyone was greatly relieved to have an end to her great suffering.  Well it just so happens that I'd been planning a trip with my friend Brian to visit another friend Ashley and his family who'd moved last year to Colorado for work.  It'd taken us a long time to find a time that would work for our schedules, and we booked the non-refundable tickets and paid the deposit on our Air bnb.  Of course the funeral happened to occur on the very day we were to leave.  When I found out, I was distraught.  I don't know why it hit me so hard.  I just felt like a heel.  I thought of cancelling my trip.  I probably should have, but I spoke with Pat and Brian and Ashley, and everyone said I shouldn't change my plans.  The only balm was that I was able to attend the visitation that happened the night before our trip.  And my lovely wife attended the funeral in my place.  I still feel guilty about it though.",32N49TQG3H4RCMU3YCK7BQ1TQPPAVT,32N49TQG3H4RCMU3YCK7BQ1TQPPAVT,0.0

It became so common for me, that I never even expected to win. This never discouraged me from trying however, in fact, if anything, it took the pressure off of attempting things for me, because I felt like I already knew the outcome. So, when I saw the advertisement for a local recreational baseball league, I thought, why not? I showed up assuming I wouldn't get chosen for the team anyway, seeing as how I have on real athletic abilities, but to my surprise, everyone else on the team was just as bad as I was! I made the team and found that I really connected with all the other players. We all seemed to have similar pasts. We were all used to being losers. None of us expected to make the team, and we all had no illusions of winning anything. It was just for fun. Having met such a like minded group was unusual and exciting for all of us.  Before we knew it, we were meeting up to practice as much as we could, just because we enjoyed the company of one another. We became a family. We understood each other. When we played we almost became one person. It was quite amazing. We played team after team, just enjoying the experience, and when we would win time and time again, we would kind of just laugh it off as a fluke, or we would assume the other team had no experience. But, before we knew it, we were in the final game, playing for the title. We all expected that this would surely be where our luck ran out, but it was not. We won. A group of failures all came together and won a championship together. That summer was one to remember. Sometimes all it takes to win, is having some fun.",,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3MTFEK6,0.0

We had been there a few times but that was years ago. We have gone on small trips here and there since then but those usually involved some kind of work. We needed a complete break and just life reset. we were just going to go for a week relax have some fun and then make our way back home. Well our trip started out with being upgraded to first class. This is something we never had the money to afford. Then we landed in orlando and  realized our baggage was lost. Some weird fluke had happened where they sent our luggage far away so to make up for it they gave us each $500 to shop for new clothes. we bought basic necessities then used the last to buy memorabilia from disney wold. We were able to spend all week relaxing and going to each diffrent park without any stress. It was the best vacation i ever took. No stress for the first time in years was also very nice.

I played baseball with a few of the nephews.  We went out to eat at a great restaraunt and had a great time. It was nice to catch up with my siblings and hang out like we used to.  We had not all been together for a long time and we reminisced.  It was a bit cold but did not snow and we built a fire outside one night and maybe drank a bit much.  My parents enjoyed seeing all of the kids running around.  It was a great time with my family and one we will repeat this year.  We discussed renting a nice lake house or something a bit closer to everybody next time.  It is hard to meet up often because we are all scattered out over the country.  It was a good reminder of how lucky I am to have such a good family.  I am looking forward to next time.,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAPZS26PT,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAPZS26PT,0.0

It was perfect. There are people who I wish had been able to attend, but I was still able to see many friends and family who I hadn't for some time. When my husband and I walked out of the temple, everyone was there to greet us and take pictures and give hugs. My husband looked perfect in his charcoal grey tux, and we couldn't stop smiling the whole time. We hired a photographer to take pictures, but my grandpa's a photographer too, so he buzzed around and took a lot of photos too. We had a reception afterwards in the Riverwoods conference center. Our reception hall turned out really beautiful, and our parents said the sweetest things. I got to meet one of my husband's sisters for the first time. A couple who my family knew when we lived in Dubai several years ago even came! Some other friends from overseas were able to attend as well, so I was really great to see them again.

From our hotel room this city spread out before us like a jewel. We walked along Lake Michigan and looked at the Azure water. We felt the warm breeze coming off the Lake. Sailboats cruised in the distance. We went to the Chicago Museum of Art. They had a large exhibition of folk art, which we enjoyed. They even had some van Goghs. We stayed there for hours, enjoying the beauty of creation. We then went to the Magnificent Mile. We enjoyed all the departments stores. We spent too much money but we had a lot of fun. As we walked back to the hotel along Lake Michigan. We saw big storm roiling the lakes waters. Though it was only 3:30 in the afternoon, it became as dark as midnight. A huge gust blew on me. I try to keep my balance, but I was thrown right into the waters of the Lake.  The water was deeper than I was tall. I flailed and splashed around. Suddenly, a man in an orange vest appeared next to me. He put his arm around me and pushed me up where another man grabbed me. An EMS Scooter took me to a warm room where I was given some hot soup.  What a surprising turn for my trip to take!",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AY9PA3W,0.0

About a month after getting engaged we decided to hire a realtor to look for a home in our area.   We looked at many different houses and even put bids on a few, but kept getting rejected.  It seemed like every house we were interested in had many people bidding on it.  Our realtor was great and kept finding homes for us to see.  My fiancé and I also kept our eye out for new homes on the market.  Our parents even got involved in our search.  We looked at homes that were in need of some renovations too.  My fiancé is great at renovating and I have an eye out for decorating.   The market was low with the amount of houses to sell and there were more people wanting to buy then houses out there.  A new home came on the market and our realtor contacted us.  We went to see it that evening.  There were 2 other people interested in the home too.  It would be the perfect house for us and only 5 minutes from our parents.  We decided to bid higher than the asking price and also write a letter about how much we loved the house.  Three  days later we found out that we had gotten the house.  It has been 2 months since we found our dream home and could not be happier.",,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AAR5A3O,0.0

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,0.0

This came as a surprise as I have only been at this job for eight months and there are people who have been there longer. I do feel as though I've been putting in more work than the others that I work with, but I was expecting it any more. This is a really significant milestone for me. I felt nervous coming into this job because it was out of my wheelhouse in terms of things that I've done in the past. Because of this, I've found myself coming in earlier and staying later to make sure that I have a grasp on all the things that I need to do here. It seems like this persistence impressed my supervisors and they went to the boss to ask that I be given a promotion and a raise. This is really a culmination of the effort I've put in to be a better employee and I'm happy with the result. Of course, I am. It's a promotion and a raise after only a short time at the job. This also means that if I decide to move on from this job that I will look better in the eyes of potential employers who may be interested in my services. I took this job on a whim, to be honest. I was unhappy at my last job and wanted to find a chance. After a few months, this is where I ended up. Now, I'm excelling at this new job and finding that my supervisors are aware of what I am doing. I think that I can make a longer career out of my time here if I continue on this road. I know that this promotion and raise will only drive me to do more work and hopefully find myself getting another promotion and raise next year. If not, I'm happy with what I have for now.",32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZ2PJBVS,,0.0

I had just moved my wife and 2 kids from Pennsylvania to New York.  Getting into a new house was really stressful for all of us. Once we had arrived saying that he had passed on. I had talked to my parents on a daily basis over the phone and no one even let me know he was sick. If I had known I would have tried to spend more time with him.  As soon as I got the call I booked a flight for myself and my family. My kids were heartbroken and I didn't know what to say to make them feel better. I helped my mom plan the memorial service. She was obviously distraught so I hope you're as much as I possibly could. It seems like she was not prepared for this either. At least we had each other to lean on in this difficult time. The day of the funeral service I ran into family I hadn't seen in many many years. I really didn't wanna speak with them for the most part because I was so upset, but I was just polite and cordial as I could be. The main thing was that I was there for my family and I remain strong for them. When it was all said and done we took a flight back to New York.

Those adventures we went on together, the vacations we shared, the silly laughs at the dumbest things... just sharing everything together. I think I am now starting to fully come to grasp with the idea that I do not need you to survive or be the best version of myself. For the longest time I thought I relied on you, that the image of ""us"" is what kept me strong and instilled confidence in me. Having made it through the remainder of the summer and single, I was able to spend a lot of time focusing on me. At first I thought perhaps it was because I wasn't good enough, or that I was doing something wrong. I can clearly see now that it is much more the idea of us both holding on to more of a perfect but unrealistic version of us being together. Perhaps you had seen this first... maybe you saw this a while ago, yet for me I am now just starting to see it. I am finally starting to smile again and find interest in old hobbies that I seemed to have lost when we were together. Allowing myself to have time to focus on my own self improvement has allowed me to mentally, physically and emotionally repair and feel more upbeat. Don't get me wrong though. There are still days that I think about you and I think about what we had. I believe I will always think about that. I am sure that you will as well. A part of me will always care for you and love you, but that part of me is no longer in love with you.",,32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZJQOBVG,0.0

That morning you asked if I would be happier without you. Unsure, I remained silent. I was hoping you would reassure me that I wouldn't be. Instead, you took my silence as an affirmation that I would be better off. You went to work and I went on with my day as normal. Little did I know that everything had changed. Days later, I tried to reconnect and work on the relationship, but you were no longer interested. It hurt me tremendously. I was counting on you for years, and despite all our problems, I was still trying to fix things. Used to our fights, I expected things to fall back into place in the next few weeks, since we could never stay away from each other for too long. That never happened. I reluctantly began going on dates with other people to try to move on and heal from your rejection, and you took that as a sign that I was seeking something or something else. I didn't know what else to do to try to fix something you didn't want anymore. Months later, we remain separated and rarely talk. It's still unbelievable to me because I never imagined we could go longer than a day without taking to each other. I have yet to tell my parents that it ended. I think that's because part of me is still holding on to hope that we'll work out. However, I'm simultaneously starting to accept that things are this way. Even though I still miss you, I no longer have the desire to tell you about everything that happens in my life. I no longer have the urge to talk to you all the time or think about you constantly. It's unfamiliar, but I guess this is what you wanted. I don't know the details of your life anymore and that's ok. In the end, I just hope we're both happy wherever we end up. I just never would have imagined it ending this way.",,32UTUBMZ7HIWVWZV4QK361LZJQOBVG,0.0

After the pizza, she wanted to play with some barbies. I decided to play with her so we went upstairs to her room to get the barbies. It took us a few minutes to decided how many to get. Her little brother also joined us. All together we probably had eight or nine barbies and a large bus for the barbies. Unfortunately, by the time we had retrieved all the barbies it was time for cake and for a six year old, cake trumps. We sang her happy birthday and lit the cake. Then she proceeded to try and blow out the candles for the next three to four minutes to no avail. It turns out her parent's had put trick candles on the cake and we all had a good laugh about it. After the cake we put some music on and danced a bit more. Finally everybody started to say their goodbyes and we all left the birthday with a few new toys and a belly full of cake.",32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIF002MO,,0.0

Since I lost my home, the best paying job I have ever had, all of my material items, my family, several friends, my kids temporarily and any thing else I could lose, I found I was starting to lose my self-confidence, my faith and even myself. I lost everything I cared about, was mentally and physically abused, heart-broken, homeless, hungry and lost. This continued on for years with little to no change or progress, no matter what I did or how hard I tried. Feeling the most lonely, sad. tired and hopeless I have ever felt in life, I started to give up.  About a month ago, however, I was shown just how fast life can turn around. I woke up one day that was looking to be just as empty and hopeless as every other day, oh how life is full of surprises! I was randomly blessed with a home after being homeless for years. Someone payed to first few months bills for me, got me moved in and helped me see a light at the end of the tunnel. My kids will be back home with me soon and I am starting to find myself again! Never give up! It's never too late! And do not ever forget that life can change in a blink of an eye. Keep pushing!",,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTI2M1,0.0

He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married. This was definitely the most romantic thing my boyfriend has ever done for me.,,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q,0.0

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.

This was at the encouragement of my therapist. I confronted my mother about her past emotional abuse of me, which caused much childhood trauma. She not only acknowledged the abuse for the first time, but she also apologized, and this was very uncharacteristic of her. We spent many hours crying and talking about the past, as well as the future. We learned new things about each other. For the first time, I felt like my mother understood me. I finally felt validated. I felt heard and yes, loved. For years, she had bullied me, denied my feelings and berated me when I tried to express how I felt about her and her behavior. After talking, I realize that she was covering up her own insecurities. Perhaps she was abused herself. She seems guarded about her own childhood. It in no way excuses her behavior. But it makes me see her as more human. I believe she has changed with age and now we are continuing to rebuild our relationship.",,32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP8DDOHK,0.0

Anyway, I mingled with the other parents while my buddy's wife tried to wrangle the unruly kids. I felt kind of bad for her, but not enough to deal with all those screaming kids myself. But, every once in a while, I would peak in on the kids, particularly my daughter. She has a hard time with kids her own age, since she's hyper-active.

His dad passed away a few months ago from cancer and it was tough on everyone. We always played golf with his dad after school since we were both on the team. His dad was a mentor to myself and someone I looked up to. I never thought we would be playing in a golf tournament together which supports the cancer foundation. We arrived early and bought a memory bag which they set on one of the greens in memory of a loved one. We were team number 8 so we had to wait for the others to start golfing first. We finished 18 holes of golf in a few hours and then met back at the shelter to see the results board. We finished third which was alright with me. It was emotional when we had to receive our award because he gave a short speech about his father. Then we headed over to the local pub and had a few beers to wind down. It was a special moment in my life. My friend appreciated my support and I was more than happy to lend a hand. Next year we plan of getting there early so we can be the first to tee off.

It was an unexpected early promotion as I was not supposed to get promoted until September, instead I got promoted in July. It really came to a surprise to me that I got the promotion so early. I suppose it was because they really enjoy my line of work and love that I am work-driven and know how to complete tasks in a timely fashion and can be consistent and meet deadlines. At least, I hope that is why they decided to give the promotion to me as early as they did. I am very pleased with my work ethic, I enjoy this company a lot and think that I can bring new and fresh ideas to this company as well as be a great manager. I just didn't think that it would happen because even though I work so hard and I want to do a great job and make sure that I am always on time and I am always striving to be a better version of myself from the day before. I like to do well in the goals and tasks that I have set for myself on a daily basis when it comes to my job, or anything that I do.

I have put so much time and effort into this place and it's starting to pay off. I know that if I put in the amount of hours, work, and dedication that I can achieve anything and for that I am so proud and honor to be apart of this establishment.

We were tired so could do nothing except going to bed. However, next morning we got amazed by the layout of casinos in the hotel; there were hundreds in number. After having breakfast, we set out to observe the sin city. There were people everywhere. We were thrilled to see amazing structures such the water show at one of the hotels. We walked all day observing hotels and casinos and trying out various drinks. The night time was even more amazing with music and songs being played. There was a memorable volcanic eruption show at a hotel next to ours. The next day we took a tour bus and traveled to various parts of the city. It was very exhilarating.

After a few weeks of casual labor, I received a call from a company I had sent an application to. They invited me to an interview for my dream job.

The first thing the company did was to check all applicants to see the people who were qualified for the job. A good number of people were screened out, and there were still a lot of people left. The office organized several sets of interviews for all applicants. It was a really though period. There were weeks of interviews, and a lot of people were rejected based on the interviews. After the series of interviews, we were left with six people. The six of us were asked to rank ourselves based on who we believed was best suited for the job.

We arrived, and a large round table was set and waiting for us.  My brother sat near me on my left.  My brother is a gentle person, but can sometimes appear to have a gruff, adversarial or judgmental tone.  When the waiter came to speak to us, my brother asked him if the salt and pepper dish (can't recall what it was, beyond the salt and pepper part) was spicy.  The waiter answered that it was not. My brother, in asking for clarification, spoke in a tone that seemed to offend the waiter.  He (my brother), said ""But the menu says it has salt and pepper on it."" The waiter seemed to jump back, and said (quite haughtily) that he would not be spoken to in that way.  After this exchange, my brother became quiet. I think he had no idea that the waiter had been offended.  I, who am used to my brother's questioning ways, was very surprised to see the waiter act so offended.

The biggest of big days, the one it seems I had been waiting for since I was a child! My wedding day had finally arrived!  Excitement did not even describe my attitude. I'd been to so many weddings before, and always was envious of the proceedings, dreaming of the day I would bring my beloved down the isle myself! But finally, I found the one I would spend the rest of my happy days with. I am honored to have found such a loving spouse to raise a family with me! The event itself was so beautiful (not as beautiful as the bride, but still quite nice!) We had a destination wedding that would take the course of 4 days, which my spouse and I agreed would be much more exciting than one closer to home. We were both right: our families both enjoyed the venue, both for its beauty and change of cultural flavor! Our family and friends from both side mingled and celebrated alongside us, treating us like newly-married royalty. We literally felt like the center of the universe for four straight days! We danced and sang for what seems like the entirety of those four days, all while relatives showered us with affections and best wishes (as is typical in a big-time Indian wedding)! Our family rushed us around, getting a view of me and my beautiful spouse. We never seemed to sleep, moving from one moment of joy to the next! It was as exhausting as it was beautiful and unforgetable!",,3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSC5ULQEY,0.0

We finally decided on an affordable spot that wasn't too far away from our previous homes, and we moved in together. This was my first time ever living with a romantic partner, and also her first time as well. In addition, it was a new experience in that we did not have an HOA. Both of us were used to living in one, and having to pay dues for that as well as follow a color scheme. I loved that I no longer had to conform to the rules and regulations of a seemingly pointless organization. To celebrate this, my partner and I decided to explore the area to find things to decorate our new yard with. We found an old school nursery nearby, (even the main business sign was a big piece of hand painted wood), and we bought some plants. Well, about 18 plants to be exact, and all but two of them were fruit or vegetable producing. So we planted these outside in our new yard to harvest. Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well. Instead of a traditional dog or cat, we ended up getting 5 pets. These include 2 leopard geckos (one albino one regular), a veiled chameleon, a roboroverski hamster, and a havana rabbit. It's felt so freeing and wonderful living with my life partner, and being able to experience our new place the way we really want to.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U7G2M54,,0.0

It was rather difficult to set up. I'm not a very tech savvy person, so it took about two hours to even get anything to display on the screen. By that point, my back was aching so badly and I felt exhausted, but I wanted to surprise my daughter with a little gift. When I brought her to the room, she seemed confused at first, but soon saw her favorite characters from the Secret Life of Pets 2 on the screen and let out a joyful scream. It was a very enjoyable experience! I baked some popcorn on our popcorn machine, picked out my daughters favorite candy, and brought some of her favorite toys to join in to watch the movie. One of her toys, ""Jim Bob,"" a large plush giraffe, sat next to my daughter and she briefly spoke to it whenever something interesting happened in the movie. She ended up loving the movie so much she wanted to watch it again. Now, that movie is extremely long, and while it definitely wasn't my favorite movie in the world, I'm glad that she was able to enjoy it so much. I mostly just sat back and watched as my daughter's smile lit up the room. I'm sure she didn't even know how much the projector cost or how hard it was to find one, but I was happy I was able to make her so happy. Moments like these always make me excited for the future. I wonder if ten years from now she'll want to watch this movie again on the projector and reminiscence about how she talked with her giraffe and tried to make him eat some of her popcorn. I wonder where she will be in ten years, and smile as I think about how she will look all grown up.",,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,0.0

Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active. I like the moments I am living with my family, I like that I am able to slow down, I like to know that I have the world as my oyster and most importantly I like to know that I am developing so many memories with all of my loved ones.",,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U839M5M,0.0

The car ended up costing over $300 not including the towing fee. Nick was fine, of course. He probably preferred the privacy and not to have his mother following him around campus. But move-in day was such a big thing for me that I'm really hurt it didn't go better. I think I'll make a special trip up there sometime this month. I want to visit and see everything.

My parents saw to it that I had a lot of great times to look back on and cherish. In the spirit of that, I wanted to pass on experiences like this to my daughter. This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2. It was an amazing night and I'm so glad I did it.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,0.0

Her relief when she could see out of the fog, her despair when she realized she was thinking ""jumbly"" again; my God how we fought against the monster.

I retired from full time employment at the end march; my sources of income now are my pension , my social security, and my m-turk work.  i am living a life now that i have never lived before.  i compare my situation, although not totally comparable, but to a prisoner who gets out of jail.  for forty years i worked at jobs that i didn't enjoy and/or were low paying, i was doing work that was too difficult for me; was unstable, etc.  so when i retired, it was like starting a new life. i thought i'd like my ""new life,"" but the fact is i love it; things are too good to be true.  not only don't i have to work anymore, but i get to spend four full days a week with my wonderful 2 year old granddaughter, Kinsley.  this is because my wife runs a small day care center right here in our house so Kinsley spends eight full hours here four days a week.  I can not express in words how much i love Kinsley.  I have one daughter but when she was young i was very distracted with a few problems that involved my job as well as some personal issues.  i didn't spend nearly as much time with my daughter as i wish i had when she was very young.  Spending all this time with my granddaughter, therefore, is a whole new experience.  watching her grow; being amazed as she does new things almost every day...amazing.  every grandparent brags about how smart their grandchildren are so i'll do the same...Kinsley is so intelligent that it almost scares me.  and she is so happy! and no wonder with loving relatives around her all the time.  besides all this, as a person who had suffered from insomnia for many years, the fact that i can now sleep when i want, with no pressure of alarm clocks or whether i got adequate sleep, it is amazing that i have no more of those pressures.  i hardly even need an alarm clock.  i don't have to worry about whether a job can provide coverage if i  want to call in sick.  i don't have to worry about driving in bad weather as i had to so often in the winter here in central new york state where we sometimes get pounded with snow storms.  i also love listening to my CDs and i recently became a frank sinatra fan; better late than never.  and i enjoy the company of my wonderful, supportive wife.  so all in all, things are great.  i paid 40 years worth of dues and i earned my freedom.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U839M5M,,0.0

I wanted to change that because I remember that I had a really fun childhood. My parents really went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my time as a kid. I've always held those values with me and wanted to pass them along to my daughter. So, I brainstormed ideas and I settled on the idea of setting up a movie theater in the backyard. I went online and did some research to get some inspiration on how to set it up. Once I had a solid idea of how I wanted to pull it off, I went to work researching projectors to find the best bang for my buck. I found a few on Amazon that I liked and, upon watching reviews on YouTube, I picked the one that was best. Surprisingly, it wasn't that expensive. I think I paid less than $300 for the whole setup. After I placed the order, I looked at my schedule to find a good night to do the movie night. When I had the details figured out, I informed my wife and she loved the idea. Before long, the movie projector came and tested it in my office while my daughter was playing outside. The quality and ease of use were impressive. It was able to be hooked up to a DVD player or a phone/tablet, which was perfect for us. I then waited until the night that I wanted to set things up. That day, she was out playing with friends and I was in the backyard secretly setting things up. I moved deck furniture and put a big blanket on the lawn. By the time i was done, it looked like a miniature living room. We then prepared snacks and broke the news to my daughter. She jumped up and down with joy before running to the backyard and freaking out over the setup. We had popcorn, candy, and sodas while watching the movie that night. It was so much fun and I really liked creating those memories for her. I felt really good afterwards and feel like I fulfilled my duties as a fun parent. At the end, my daughter ran up and hugged/kissed me and told me I was the best dad ever.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,,0.0

She was such a part of my life for the 24 years that I have been alive. When she passed away two years ago, I had just graduated from college and about to start my professional career. I had just been offered a job in a city on the other side of the country, and decided to move there, even though it meant being away from my friends and family. I know as the youngest of 4 children, this move was going to be hard on my Mom. She had always been so supportive of me throughout my life. She was always there for the good times, and the bad: when I fell off my bike and skinned my knee; when my first girl friend in junior high broke up with me; and when I didn't make it into my first choice for college. Mom was always there to comfort me and reassure me that everything was going to be alright. Mom had raised the four of us since my dad passed away when I was only six, and she devoted her life to us, really. Even though she had a college degree, and could have had a fulfilling career, she sacrificed that to make sure my siblings and I had good, safe home. The day I left for my new job and home, I said goodbye to Mom with tears in my eyes. I told her I would be home at Christmas, and not to worry about me. As always, she gave me a tight hug, and said that I would be successful at whatever I chose to do, and that she would always support me. I really thought I would see her in 4 months, so as I boarded the plane, I wave goodbye, thinking I'll see her soon. She looked to positive and hopeful, my last glimpse of her. It was only two days later, at my new job, that I got the terrible news. Mom had died suddenly from a massive heart attack. Even now, two years later, the day she died haunts me. There were so many things left unsaid to her. I thought I would have time to tell her how much she shaped my life and my character. How much she had sacrificed for me. She was only 60 years old, plenty of time to spend with her, plenty of time to let her know how much I loved her. Mom's sudden passing taught me to never wait to tell the ones you love how much they mean to you, how much you miss them. Time is short.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKHE8AH4,0.0

She's stayed with us for several weeks while I nursed back. Johnny loved having grandma around to take care of him while mommy was trying to recooperate. Dr Gevorkian even made a home call to check on me. He said that my sinuses are healing nicely. He forsees a full recovery. My husband is grateful to both the doctor and my mom.

The 16 year olds are twins (just for the record).  In the middle of those, I have an 18 year old daughter.  She has always been fairly quiet and somewhat reserved, but has been a good kid and we rarely have had to worry about her.  She decided several years ago that she wanted to graduate from high school with an associates degree.  My wife and I both thought this was a great idea and we fully supported her in doing this, but we also advised here that it would be a lot of work. When she got to high school, she got right into it.  Initially, at least, she needed some help figuring out how to go about knowing what classes to take, etc.  She also couldn't start the ""early college"" program until she was a junior (11th grade).  She worked hard and put in a lot of effort between her 11th and 12th grade years.  We were very pleased to see what she was doing. This past April, she graduated with her associates degree in general studies (with honors) a month ahead of her high school graduation.  The following month, she graduated from high school with honors.   I was very proud of her and thought she had done an outstanding job.  We thought the future for her looked bright. A few weeks after her high school graduation, I discovered a number of messages on her instragram account, which were on a shared cell phone we use as the ""home"" phone.  The messages were between her and a relative and were extremely vulgar, crude and inappropriate.  My head hurt more than it ever had after reading these messages because my view of my daughter had changed and not for the better.  I was disappointed and distressed to have this happen. Shortly thereafter, in early June, while I was at work, she told my wife that she was leaving.  She packed up some of her things , walked out the door, and left.  I have not spoken to her since, although we know where she is.  I have been heartbroken about this and have not known what to do about the situation.  She's 18 and can make her own choices, but we wished she had not made this choice.",339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVPMUIK2,339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVPMUIK2,0.0

I was quite miserable, comparable to a sinus infection for years with no real relief. Multiple doctors, many rounds of steroids and antibiotics with no relief. At one point I was offered depression medications.  I was also scared to have someone cutting and cleaning right next to my brain and eyes with only a couple thin bones in between. But at this point I felt desperate. My quality of life was rather low so I was determined to go through with the surgery. And I'm glad I did and I'm grateful I found my ENT doctor when I did. My husband's mother took care of our toddler while my mother and husband accompanied me. I'm grateful for my husband for distracting me with talk of anything other than what was happening that day and rubbing my cold feet before surgery. It really is the little things in life that are most memorable. Breathing through one's nose is definitely something a lot of people take for granted. I remember laying on the freezing cold operating table with nurses, techs, doctor and all the machines as a nurse injected the drug to put me under which felt like cold fire in my veins. I remember waking up in recovery with my nose packed full of gauze and such, wondering where my family was. I've only been under anesthesia one other time and to be honest it is a rather traumatizing experience but the nurses and doctors certainly don't acknowledge it as such.",339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVOKSKIX,,0.0

There was little warning and no outward signs that definitively pointed to any form of dementia at all. Oh, there was the occasional forgetfulness and a few times the month before her diagnosis where she called me one day to tell me something and then called again three days later to tell me the same thing again. But that only occurred the month prior. My aunt and I compared notes that month and she had experienced the same thing and that was the first clue that anything was wrong. My mother retired to Florida about 20 years ago, my aunt lives in Ohio and I live in Texas and we get to see each other maybe once a year. My mother is 80 so she doesn't do email or text and she doesn't have a smartphone, just the old style flip phone with the big numbers on it. But we all talk to each other almost every week, that is, we used to talk to each other each week until this past March when we saw the first signs. Then April rolled around and that's the month of my birthday and she always calls on that day but this year there was no call. I let it pass and didn't think much of it until my aunt called me towards the end of April when we both realized neither of us had spoken to her for the entire month. We call my brother went over there and found her in bed pretty much incoherent, the condo was a mess and she mumbled something about falling. He took her to the hospital to get her checked out and the doctor said there were no signs of a stroke but he saw bruising on her hip, knee and arm and noted that he thought she probably had taken a bad fall so she stayed in the hospital for a few days under observation. The doctor told them she needed a walker because her knee was not supporting her weight very well and also advised them to have her schedule an appointment with her primary physician because she probably needed a brain scan to rule out other causes of her confusion. It was 3 weeks before she was able to get the brain scan and the confirmed diagnosis at that point was Alzheimer's. She was in a long term care facility within a month and she started losing ground fast. She no longer recognized anyone and she couldn't use the phone at all anymore so no more phone calls. After 2 months she quit eating and they had to put her in hospice which is where she remains today. She gets more attention there and has recovered at least some of the body weight she lost because she simply didn't experience or recognize hunger any longer. We've all learned several hard lessons around this development. Alzheimer's now runs in the family and all 4 of us kids now have an increased chance of being diagnosed with it. I'm 64 and I have to think about the burden that puts on my kids and my wife. 5 months ago? It didn't even register on my list of possibilities but Alzheimer's just changed my life and I don't even have it. Yet.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKKXWHA4,0.0

We'd laugh and carry on like always. Her presence was always calming. She brightened every day she touched. So, sad as I was, it felt right to speak for her. In my eulogy, I talked about what a good person she was. No matter what was going on, she always saw the bright side. No matter what a person did, she always thought positively.

My daughter moved out very quickly and went to live with my mother-in-law who lives about two miles away.   She is kind enough and claims to be ""non-judgmental"", but loves to dish out judgment whenever it suits her.  That said, my daughter thought this was a better way to live than to stay with us.  As she is 18, there is little we could do about that.  However, that doesn't change the fact that my wife and I were heartbroken about this situation.  But, we laid back and let her ""do her thing"" which, apparently, included quitting her job, something we would not have allowed.  (We require our children to work and help support themselves once they are old enough).  Generally speaking, she avoided contact with us, in spite of our efforts to be inviting and friendly.  We did our best to honor her wishes unless she contacted us.  We did get occasional negative feedback from my mother-in-law, which we ignored as best we could.  This was not how we wanted things to go for her, but as a teenager, she apparently knows better.  We were concerned that she would not continue with school (for which she has a full scholarship) or would do other ""dumb"" things.  All we could really do was sit back and wait.  Heck, even when she would come over to the house to see her sisters, she would only do so when my wife and I were not at home.  And, she would sneak away after we came back home.  It has been a distressing few months, to say the least. For many years we've had cats in our home, and our children grew up with those cats.  We had one pass away in late 2016, whom we missed greatly.  But of the two remaining cats, one had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism two or three years ago.  We had been treating this with medicine and he seemed to have responded well overall.  However, in early October of this year, I found him under the bed of one of my other daughters and when I pulled him out, I realized that something was seriously wrong with him - it appeared he had had a stroke and was paralyzed and blind.  This cat was a much-beloved member of the family, and particularly to my daughters.  We took him to the vet who confirmed what we thought and had him put down.  It did break our hearts, but it did one thing that surprised us:  our daughter began coming around again when my wife and I were around and would at least say...something...to us, which we considered to be a huge improvement.",339ANSOTR6OS2TJPBWYDQFEVPMUIK2,,0.0

On her birthday I and my husband decided to make it  memorable one for her and the kids by buying a sugar glider to surprise on her birthday. she had always a pet the kids had all been yearning for a pet. so six months ago we started preparing for her big day, we bought cakes, drinks and lots of stuff so the children that came to celebrate with Anabel would have fun. On the day of her birthday it turned out she had a flu due to the cold that season, so she was not really in a great mode. the other children were expecting to see a vibrant and playful Anabel, but she was dull and moody. so we decided to make her feel better by showing her the surprise we had for her. when she saw the sugar glider she was so excited that it felt like she was not even sick in the first place. Everyone invited to my youngest daughter's birthday party had a great time, even though it was cold. They got to play with a sugar glider and see it jump on my oldest daughter's head. My youngest daughter (the birthday girl) surprised everyone by take a few steps in-front of them. She showed them how to pat the sugar glider properly.

After we set up the campsite and put up the tents, we decided to go swimming in the lake. It was a fun day with the family and we celebrated with hotdogs and hamburgers for dinner. Later at night, we roasted marsh-mellows and made s'mores. The next day we woke up early and decided to go for a hike around the lake. When noon came along, it started to get pretty hot.

This was an outing to enjoy the nice weather with my grandson and granddaughter, as well as a time to show them the beauty of Lake Ontario. I am older and have minor mobility issues. When we got to the lake shore, the water was very wavy and the level was high so the strip of sand for walking was narrow. I decided to rest while the rest of the party headed up to the bluffs. I sat down on a fallen log. My granddaughter was so joyous to see the lake, which she thought was as grand as the ocean. I assumed the three of them would continue on to the bluffs. Then the most surprising thing happened. My 10 year old grandson said that he couldn't leave his granny there by herself, and he chose to sit with me. We sat for a long time talking. Afterwhile, we realized that the others should have returned, but they hadn't. Also my cellphone was dead, and I wasn't able to stand up by myself.

Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad. Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. Later on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AWV5117,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AWV5117,0.0

At that time, we had chatted for a while and then I had gone to visit her in New York City, where she was from, but a few weeks later, the brief beginning to a possible romance ended. I thought about her a lot over the next several months, and finally, about 5 months later, I contacted her again. I didn't know if she would respond, but to my delight, she did. However, emotions and feelings still had to be sorted out and ultimately we took a month or so break from communication again. It was then, in June, while about to take a week-long vacation to the beach with my family -- the travel route of which would take my by the town where she lived while going to school -- that we reconnected and planned to meet up on my way back from the beach. We decided to go to a theme park close by, one that I hadn't been to since I was probably in high school. All week I was excited and a bit nervous. Would this simply be two friends hanging out, or would it be something more? When I finally met up with her, things were a bit awkward at first; it had been a long time since we had seen each other and I was trying to feel out how to act. However, the next day when we went to the park, things were very fun and the conversation between us flowed naturally and easily. We even flirted and made some physical contact. We spent a long day at the park and rode all sorts of rides, and in the time we spend walking around and waiting in line, we talked a lot about each other and grew closer. At the end of the day, we went to her place -- both of us were pretty exhausted. While we were there, we talked intensely about the situation between us and really made a heart-to-heart connection. I told her I had wanted to kiss her all day but wasn't sure if I should. She responded that she had been waiting for me to do so. We sealed the day with a kiss, and since then we've been seeing each other almost every week. I think back to that day a lot as the start of something wonderful.",,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AXSO11L,0.0

We spent the day riding some rides together. We had made a deal with each other that she would choose a ride, then I would get to choose a ride and we both would ride them together. We laughed with each other the whole time. It was like old times. It was so good to feel that feeling again that we once shared together. It made we wonder why we both never tried making our relationship last. Throughout the day we grew closer to one another. She began to open up to me and we decided that we try and make it work out again. Now that we both know we want each other in our lives we made a promise that we would both give it our all. We decided to have some lunch, so I took her to the side of the park that had a nice view, laid a blanket down, and told her I would be right back with our food. I went to get our food and stopped by a booth that was selling flowers. I thought she would like it if I surprised her with them.  I was walking back to where she was and surprised her with the flowers. She loved them. We sat and enjoyed our lunch together before leaving the theme park.

Over the course of the year, I made several friends, one of whom invited me to visit him in his hometown of Ormond Beach over the Fourth of July weekend. We left on Thursday and arrived later that night, taking in a fireworks show before retiring for the evening. The following day, we visited a friend of the family at his home just out of town. He owned a fairly large amount of property which he used, in part, as a gun range. While neither my friend nor I are particularly pro-gun, my friend studies World War II history and owns a number of historic weapons that he wanted to operate. So we spent much of the day there until poor weather forced us indoors. Once the storms cleared out, we went back outside to take in a private fireworks show of questionable legality. The following day, we spent some time exploring Daytona Beach. We visited a few shops and my friend showed me a few of the more interesting sights. Later, we returned to Ormond and checked out the Rockefeller house. That night, we went to the race at Daytona Speedway. My friend's family owns property near the track and consequently has some connections, so we were able to tour the raceway prior to the race. Unfortunately the race was rained out, but it was still a memorable time. The following day, we returned to Gainesville, but prior to leaving, we decided to visit the beach. I spent almost my entire life in Ohio, and Gainesville, while obviously much closer to the sea, is still landlocked, so this marked the first time I got to see an ocean. We walked and chatted along the beach for an hour or so. There was nothing particularly remarkable about the experience, but getting to see the Atlantic for the first time was quite memorable.",33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,,0.0

When we arrived and got off the airplane we went to rent a car but because we were not from the country we had a hard time. We would have no idea how to even drive a car in Croatia because they drive on the other side of the road. Because of this we tried to take an uber to the hotel for the night but we got lost. Trying to talk to the uber driver was hard! He didn't speak english so our friends got out and tried to find another driver. We opted for a ride share and when the driver came to pick us up we all piled inside. After being in the car for a few minutes, another passenger got in. We couldn't believe our eyes! It was the singer of our favorite band, the one we would be seeing the next day! It turns out he was staying at the same hotel as us and we got his autograph when we got out of the car at the hotel. The show was awesome and he even waved at us after they were done playing their set. It was such an amazing experience!",,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779QB1C8T,0.0

I was very hurt and felt depressed for quite some time  after he passed away. He was in the hospital , because he had diabetes and had his leg amputated. He died at an early age, and it was devastating to my family and I. I told myself that I would do my best to avoid getting diabetes by eating healthy, and always exercising. I saw first hand what it can do to a person. I took my father for granted at times because we did not spend as lot of time with each other. I moved out of town and stayed with my partner for months at a time, before I went back to see my parents. I really regret not spending more time with my father, because as I grew up I know we could of got more close. Me and my father were not that close but he always provided for my family. I appreciated him very much and still miss him to this day. A lot of people helped me get through this experience, it made me stronger mentally and physically. I will try to educate other people about diabetes, and the effects of it. I will do my best to help other people out with diabetes. It is very serious and an epidemic around the world.",33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,,0.0

We participated in a number of activities, including a Nascar race (which was postponed, unfortunately). On Friday, we visited a friend of my friend's family. My friend, though liberal, collects old firearms, and the guy we visited owns an outdoor range. So we spent some time there firing off different weapons before ""enjoying"" a private, amateur fireworks show.  But the final day was most memorable. Ormond is right on the Atlantic coast, so on the way back, we decided to stop and spend some time on the beach. I've lived in Ohio for most of my life, only moving down to Florida last year. And since I'm in central Florida, I'm not overly close to the ocean. So this was the first time since I was very little that I had seen the ocean. We walked along the beach for a bit and chatted. The conversation wasn't overly memorable, but I found the walk very relaxing and enjoyable. I enjoyed the trip as a whole, but we tried cramming a lot of events in a short period of time, so things got a bit chaotic at points. The beach walk was easily the most relaxing part, and a really nice way to end the weekend. We probably spent an hour and a half or so walking along the beach. Once the sun started going down, we departed. I would be fine writing about this in the future.",33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,0.0

When my father died, it hurt me and my family. My father was fairly young when he died at the age of 47. It was a hard time for everyone after he passed away. My father died about 6 months ago due to diabetes. He was a diabetic for a long time, but then he had a stroke, and it made his condition even worse. My father was a healthy man a few years back, but he liked to drink alcohol.. mainly beers. After work, he would always drink a few beers to relax. After my father had the stroke, he past away a few months after. It really hurt me to see him die fairly young, and it devastated my family. I could not function properly after he died, and it left me depressed. It left me to a point where I started drinking myself, just to let the pain go of him not being here anymore. I had to tell myself that drinking was not the answer, and he would want me to move on, and continue to make him proud by being successful in life. It was a very painful time in my life. I got through it with help of friends and family, and now I try my best to make my father proud, by being the best man I can be.",33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,0.0

And now in July of 2019, I am feeling almost 100 percent able to reflect on his death without feeling overwhelming sorrow.  I wouldn't be at this point without all the help I've received from my family and friends though.  They helped me nearly everyday and assisted me in looking at his death as a turning point.  I am able to view it as an outsider and I even learn from his death.  I've learned to take care of myself better.  His death taught me that diabetes and poor health is something that should be taken seriously.  I've learned to better myself and eat healthy.  So in a way his death helped me become a better person.  I am grateful towards this.  Although I miss my father greatly, I am able to live my life.  So a loss of a life, has helped me take more control of my own life as weird as this sounds.  I will never completely get over the loss of my dad, but I can confidently say that I am getting much better thanks to all the help of my friends and family and being able to look at it through a different light.",,33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,0.0

Moving to California was a really difficult decision.  I'd lived in Washington DC for the last 10 years, and all my friends and family are there, or on the East Coast.  I originally moved to Malibu, and, though it was beautiful, I felt isolated and really missed my friends and family.  I was really surprised at how unhappy I felt.  Then I moved to West Hollywood and was closer to some of the friends I had made in college who lived out there. Though the weather was beautiful, I often felt lonely.  A few months ago I joined a MeetUp group for new people living in LA.  Thorough it I've made some really great friends, and really realize how important connection in in life.  I've come to realize that it really isn't where you live that makes a person happy, it is the people you're with.  I've since also reconnected with friends I'd lost contact with from college, and even from high school.  Now that I have friends out here, I feel so much happier, and am able to enjoy the great weather and the beach.

A person's career determines their lifestyle both in terms of time and resources available for leisure. Many people also derive a lot of their identity from what they do for work or a career. There are also many industries where a lifestyle may be tied up in a career. For instance, folks that work in the alcohol industry have a pretty specific lifestyle that tends to correspond to their choice of career. Ideally people would be made up of more than just the careers they've chosen but all too often you find folks that seem to have cobbled together an identity based on what they expect people expect of them. In my mind, the most interesting people are folks that have very different careers and lifestyles that sometimes combine in surprising ways. As much as I kind of detest Elizabeth Gilbert, I listened to a talk that she gave about people with different styles of going through life. Some who are incredibly driven and work towards a singular goal but are frankly rather boring. And then there are those that flit from thing to thing and develop a diverse skill set and may not have a huge singular accomplishment but are likely super interesting. There is also a lot to be said for getting out of one's comfort zone. If we only interact with people in a similar career to ourselves, we risk missing out on the upsides of diversity. The same can be said for lifestyle.  If you only hang out with people that have a similar lifestyle, you won't learn much or experience many new things. Especially in cases where a lifestyle is harmful it can be really good to experience folks living in a different way.",,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G9K5MNA,0.0

He suffers manic episodes that can be sad,happy or angry episodes. When this happens he goes to my parents house (where i live) and caused infrastructure and mental destruction. It depends on the epsiode but most of the time  it involves yelling and screaming that is very frightening.  The  scariest day I can write about was the day that my  parents were leaving for vacation to vegas, They were only going to spend the weekend. Unfortunately, the weeks leading up to the vacation were a bad couple of weeks mentally for my brother. The fact that my parents were leaving Miami disturbed him and he was causing all sorts of trouble  leading up to the vacation like Arguments, Fights at the house, mean text messages. Before my parents  left my father told me I would be in charge of the family business while hes gone. We manufacture vacuum pump trucks so its  not an  easy  job, there's a lot of heavy machinery  involved, so i was anxious myself  because I had been handed a big task. Its the day that my parents are leaving  for vacation and I'm fast asleep waiting for my 7:30 alarm in slumber. As I'm dreaming I begin to hear something in  my trance like state and start  slowing awakening to Traumatic sobbing from the terrace of the  house and at this point I'm not sure if im still dreaming or some weird sound is coming from the outside. As i  awaken more I notice its my brother hysterically crying while my dad hugs Him. Its very strange that hes showing up  at 5am because he never does this. His crying was the first stage of his manic episode. I dont like to see him  like this so i often avoid speaking to him when hes in his very sobbing and depressed state. So i  tell myself I'll go ahead and  take a shower so maybe he wont see me. I'm very spooked, You have to understand that his manic episodes that start  with depression are by far the worst, It lasts longer, days. I get Into the shower and as I'm taking off my clothes I hear the door to the bathroom start rattling around like someone is forcefully trying open the door. I yell ""Hello?!?!"" but theres no response. Shortly after the rattling begins again but  more aggressively. I had to  cut the story in half for part 1  - True Story - It gets much  worse. -  let me know if you want the rest.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,0.0

I've had this session for a while (it was a gift) but it took me almost 3 years post-death to scrape up the courage to actually do it. I was skeptical, absolutely—I do believe in spirits and that our energy has to go somewhere after death, but that's a far leap to actually communicating with a dead person. So, going into it, I was honestly more scared that it was going to work than that it wouldn't. The first few questions he asked me were basic—said that he was seeing a father figure and asked me if a grandfather of mine had died. Being my age, it's fairly reasonable to assume that at least one of my grandfathers are dead (both are) and as I wasn't particularly close to mine, as he was talking about him, I was starting to write the psychic off as a phony. However, then he asked me if there was someone specific I wanted to contact, and of course, there was; I asked him to bring my friend forward by repeating her name multiple times. Immediately, things felt different. He started pulling out details about her death that were 100% accurate, and while I was definitely getting closer to believing him, I still wondered if he had researched my social media in depth or taken the time to do a deep search on people in my life. But as we went on, he started recalling things that there were absolutely no way he could have known. He pulled memories out, he described the streets I walk on on my way to work (where apparently, my friend walks alongside me sometimes). He talked about her parents, about how she feels now that she's in a different place, and asked about our other mutual friends. At this point, I was pretty convinced (and emotional, of course). It wasn't until he pulled out a very specific detail—something that had only taken place in a private setting after my friend had already died—that I absolutely lost it and started sobbing; I knew it was real. I was somewhat in shock; I was essentially communicating with someone that I was sure I would never have the chance to again. The session was only 45 minutes long, and I wish I could have had longer, but it provided me with a sense of closure that I hadn't felt in years. It made me sad, for sure, but it also made me happier, and it felt like I was relieving a burden. It was one of the things that have affected me most in my recent life.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QMMNU,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QMMNU,0.0

My  brother suffers from chronic depression and is believed to  be bipolar. I could already tell  my brother was going  to have a  manic episode that day. So i thought i would take a shower early before he was able to lock me  into  a conversation and i  would have to speak to my  brother and look into the eyes of a brother i had lost years ago. In order to understand my situation, as the reader you have to understand that his manic episodes come in packages; Anger, Sadness and euphoria. I wasnt sure what emotion was  going to come out tooday so i decided to get in the  shower. As im getting  in the shower the dooor knob starts to rattle. I immediately know its my  brother but i act like i dont know who  it is. ""hello!?"" i call out. The doorknob begins to rattle even more viciously than before. i call out once more and bang the door ""HELLO!?"". As i open the door because the rattling wont stop its my brother, or is a shell of what he once was. He is unshaven, 100 lbs overweight and smells and looks like he hasnt showered in a week. I tell him  ""dude what the fuck?"" but he just stares at me and doesnt say a word. after about 10 seconds of awkward silence he says  ""im going to work today fucker"" and leaves me with an manical smille.

In order to save money, I have them sent from my insurance by mail order. I had just run out of the medication for my fibromyalgia when I checked my mail and found something from the pharmacy. But there was only one medication, the one for heartburn. I thought the other two may have been sent separately. I was worried because you're not suppose to stop taking this medication and even missing a single dose can make you a little sick. The first day I started getting increased pain, especially in my knees. I also started having problems thinking and concentrating. By Sunday I started feeling very weak, dizzy and like I had a bad stomach virus. I ended up really sick. I couldn't eat much and that also made my blood sugar issues worse. The pain got so intense that it felt as though all my bones were being twisted. It was like being in a nightmare. They had agreed to reconsider the medication and said it would take about 10 days. But as things kept getting worse so quickly, I wasn't sure I'd last that long. I live alone, so I kept my door unlocked in case I needed emergency help and couldn't open it myself, or to make it easier to find my body if I died. I didn't bathe for a few days because I worried I'd be too weak to climb out of the bathtub and possibly slip and die slowly from a head injury. They finally agreed to cover the medication and sent it express. I am still recovering from this. The worst of the pain is gone, but the knees still hurt. Since I also struggled with depression all my life and this medication also helps there, I've been really struggling with more depression. I'm still having trouble thinking and concentrating and my greatest worry is that my brain might not come all the way back. I'm suppose to see my doctor today to check on the progress. Hopefully he can ease my mind.",33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5RXA1TZ,33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K5RXA1TZ,0.0

I assured him that he was in a locked room, safe and I would remain with him until the police arrived. Next thing I know, he pulls a gun out of his pocket. I slowly back away from him and move a large biohazard garbage bin (on wheels) between him and I. I move slowly to the door and reach for the handle. He points the gun at me and yells not to open the door. I assure him that I'm not going to open the door, I was just holding the handle so no one else opened it. I asked him to please let me leave. He reiterated ""don't open the door"". I remained calm and tried to keep him calm as well as he remained on the phone with the police. Once more, I stated ""please let me leave.

He and I had not spoken in almost two years because we had a falling out towards the end of 2017. This was a friend I made in graduate school, and with whom I used to hang out fairly regularly for about four years. We would go to the movies, go hiking, have lunch, and other things. I helped him through a particularly rough patch when he lost two people close to him and went though a breakup within a year's span. I was glad to have him as a friend and we could talk about important matters with one another. At one point, however, our friendship became very strained, and we had an argument, after which we didn't speak for almost two years. When I received that text (which was simply a ""Hi, how are you?""), I was very unsure about whether to respond to it or not. I put it off for a few hours, but finally decided to answer back. I did not receive a response for several days, and was not sure what happened: whether he was experiencing a major issue or just wanted to be friends again. When he finally texted me back several days later, it turned out he was reaching out to invite me to his wedding. He was getting married the next month, and wanted to reconnect and make amends. I was taken aback because I had not expected to ever hear from him again. I was cautious about going, but decided to accept his invitation after consulting with a few people about whether it would be a good idea. The wedding was in just a few weeks, so it was short notice, and this would be the first time we were seeing each other in almost two years. I was afraid it would be awkward or tense. Luckily, the wedding was a beautiful occasion, and I was glad I went and was able to reconnect with him after all this time. His wife is a very intelligent and lovely woman, and I am happy for him, especially after the difficult time he went through.",33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NO620RXW,33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NO620RXW,0.0

I assured her that of course I wasn't mad, and that I would always love her no matter what. I also told her how proud I was of her. I just wanted her to be healthy and happy. I did remind her about making good choices in her relationships regardless of who they are with. We just jugged and cried for a while.

We had a good conversation and reaffirmed that we support her. I am glad that we have been able to be more open with each other since this happened.",33OOO72IVI70S9NCDVGJG33WVU8CT7,,0.0

It was discouraging for sure. But I decided to try again. My next stream had a title that I thought would work. Before I knew it I started getting people in my chat.

I wasn't expecting much, honestly, because we are not rich by any means and usually birthdays are a pretty simple affair. After a delicious home-cooked dinner, my husband and I were just about to dig into some cake when he slipped away to our bedroom to receive a wrapped gift. I was already so surprised, since we don't typically do gifts. He looked so excited giving it to me, I couldn't help but tear into it. Inside I found concert tickets! This was really thrilling because we haven't been out to see anything live in years and I've been dreaming of doing something just like this. What really got me, though, was when I noticed that the tickets were to go see Paul McCartney! The Beatles (and Paul) have honestly always been my favorite since I was a child, but I never imagined I'd go and see one of them live. I was so touched, and my husband just had the cutest smile on his face. I didn't want to say anything, but I know that the tickets must have been pretty expensive and it would have taken him a long time to save up for them. I just think it's one of the sweetest things he has ever done for me. The next night we went out for dinner before catching the show and the whole thing was just a dream. We had so much fun and I felt ten years younger! We danced and sang along together, and when we went home we both couldn't stop talking about how great the show had been. I don't think I will ever forget this birthday, it was such a delight.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J5E8JIDA,0.0

I woke up that morning as usual, got dressed and was about going out foe work. I received a call from my sister that my cousin had fainted that morning. We all grew up together, and the said cousin grew up with us in the same house, so I regard her as more of a blood sister than a cousin. Immediately after I received the call, I called into work to tell inform that I would not be coming in that day for family emergency reasons. Shortly after, I drove to the hospital were she was admitted. When I arrived at the hospital, my sister was already there along side with most of the patients family members. We were all worried sick for her because there were no apparent symptoms, and according to her husband she slept very well the previous night. After a while, the test results were in and it was determined that she had brain cancer. We were all scared for her, but it was also our duty to remain strong for her. Over the next couple of weeks and months, we tried to encourage her to fight and remain strong. She first started with chemotherapy, which was not doing her much good. She then opted to have a surgery. The surgery ended up been more complicated than we expected, but after all the surgeries, she continued chemo. At this point we thought she was in a good place, and that she was recovering. A few weeks later she died. It came as a surprise to all her well wishers because we genuinely thought she was getting better. Two days before her death, she went out with her husband and kids, and they had some fun.

I woke up on a bright sunny day feeling like the world was mine for the taking. I had an important meeting for work later on that afternoon, but did not have any other obligations until then. My parents had recently just divorced and my father had moved into his own little apartment in town. He was never the best at making meals for himself so I had started the habit of dropping him off some casseroles that I had prepared for him. I feared that he was lonely and heartbroken after my mother's infidelity. So, on that beautiful summer morning I decided that I would use my extra spare time to lend him a visit, and bring him some delicious lasagna that I had baked the night before. I drove there with the roof of my convertible down and the wind in my hair blasting some old favorite rock songs from days past. When I arrived to his residence, I saw that the cat was out on the porch. This struck me as unusual as my father had always been adamant that we watch the doors and not let our feline friends risk being run over by traffic. I picked fluffy up in my my arms and proceeded through the half opened door. I called out for my father with no response. I noticed a note on the counter that was addressed to me, it read: ""Honey, I love you, please do not go in the bedroom"". My heart started pounding out of my chest as I ran over to the bedroom. To my horror, I found my father laying on the floor, his head covered in blood with a revolver by his side. He had taken his own life and left me to find him.

The breakup had really hurt me for a long time. She was truly the first person I truly loved. So while I was nervous, I was also very exited. I remember trying on so many different outfits to make a good impression. I finally decided on a nice black button down shirt. I matched with black boots and dark blue jeans. Then the time came to finally meet. I also remember my hair was looking good that day, so that was good! Anyways, I got in my car to go to the restaurant. She looked absolutely stunning! We hugged and sat down together. The conversation was really great, like we never missed a beat. The whole thing felt really natural. Then it was time for us to part, so we walked outside together. We kissed and it felt so damn good! I've been thinking of this moment since then. In a way I wish we continued an affair. But that's not what happened. After that kiss we agreed not to act on those feelings.",33UKMF931A6HEQPNZHB95D30BBITTZ,,0.0

As I mentioned in previous entries, my sister moved out of the country to take a position for a new company. This was a big deal for her, as it was something that she wanted to do, and was excited about. A little over a year ago, she started to feel ill, so she want to the doctor. After doing some medical examinations, it came back that she was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The doctor recommended exploratory surgery. About 4 months ago, they proceeded with the exploratory surgery, and discovered that is was less serious than they originally believed (which is a relief). The bad news is that they cannot safely remove the entire tumor. I spoke with my sister on the phone just now, and she is in good spirits. I have always known her to be optomistic about life in general, and I know that she can pull through. Even still it is scary to think about her mortality, and also the fact that I may not see her again. She did invite me to come out for a visit in the summer, and I am excited to make that trip as I have never left the United States before. Now I need to focus on saving up money for the flight, and also thinking about what I would bring with me! Hopefully the weather would be good when I go. Everything else on the home front has been fine, except for the fact that the dog is wanting to go for a walk now. I better take him, goodbye for now!",,345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL48VVU3B,0.0

My wife had planned a vacation that included her and the kids but not me. I unfortunately was unable to go. I had brought up cooking some bbq to send with them on this trip. She was all for it. I generally cook several times throughout the year on our big offset cooker. When I do this we generally have friends and family over to enjoy some bbq and have drinks. Occasionally I will also share with the neighbors and make kind of a big thing out of it. I woke up around 4am the day before she was leaving and got the cooker going. This was easy as I made sure everything was in order and prepared as far as the cooker goes the day before this, all I had to do was start the fire and go in and prep meat. I went inside and prepped about 30lbs of meat to cook. She had some last minute running around to throughout the day, and I stayed back in order to cook.  During this particular cook, these hit their plateau and stayed there. Probably longest plateau I have ever experienced since I have been cooking bbq this way. We pulled them from the cooker at around 10pm-ish and let them rest. When they were ready we shredded/pulled the meat and vacuum sealed all of it for the trip. We had talked back and forth for the first couple days and she never mentioned eating the bbq. I just thought maybe they heated it up and a few people joined them for dinner and really didn't think much of it. I had received some pictures in a text of a big tent set up and tables and stuff. I wasn't sure what to think. I wasn't sure that everyone would like my bbq. I received more pics of everyone eating bbq and having a great time. It was a success. Some people she explained had three and 4 pulled pork sandwiches. Some people who weren't originally coming to this thing ended up showing up anyways to eat once word got around.",33TIN5LC05WUBXF3BHTRMUU3394Y9D,,0.0

First, I was named to be among the most successful students in my class!  I ran into and old friend from childhood that I haven't seen in 2 years and my brother who has been missing for 6 months finally came home and was knocking at the door!   This of course was the most shocking event of the past 2 weeks.  When I heard a knock at the door one afternoon after school I pretty much opened the door without even so much as looking to see who it was, which was my habit.  You can imagine my shock and surprise to see my brother that no one has seen in 6 months, and thought the worst, standing there before me!  It took a few seconds before I was able to scream out, you're back!  Thinking back now, my brother wasn't even the least bit excited to see me or to be home for that matter. It was almost as if he just went out for a few minutes and was back being greeted by a hysterical brother. He finally walks inside and I am still at the door holding it open when I hear another excited scream come from a distant part of the house.  It was my poor mother  who has been besides herself with worry these past couple of months. I slowly close the door and walk back inside to find my mother and brother.   My mother is asking rapid fire questions to my mostly emotionless brother who seemed to look like maybe this was a bad idea.

I took many classes and received many certifications in fields such as project management, leadership, etc. I had no other choice. So, I applied and was accepted. I was very happy. I told my manager and he agreed that other people on my team need to step up and share my workload and I cannot be the only spokesperson for the company when regulatory bodies audit. I happily shared my news with my co-workers, and as expected, they were less than thrilled. Now, they would have to stop being lazy slackers and actually do some work.

I had moved to three different departments, went through various managers, but was still doing menial customer service types of jobs. Even though I was making a decent amount of money, the jobs were very boring and I was not at all challenged. I was promoted into leadership and that lasted less than a year due to upper management deciding to restructure departments. I was back to doing menial work and to add insult to injury, another person in my department slyly slid into my old role (without the title or the raise) and stopped doing his assigned job. I was appalled that this was allowed. I chose to go back to school as I felt my future (despite glowing reviews and taking the lead during FDA audits) was limited. I applied to my alma mater's MBA program and was accepted one week later. I was happy and proud of myself to finally doing what I have been talking about doing for years. When school started, I was incredibly busy and was assigned even more work at work. I attempted to negotiate a raise, but was told that despite doing the work of 4 people ( I was the lead of 3 other people, who were reassigned to other teams when those teams workload exploded), my work was not ""risky"" therefore I should not be paid more than other people on the overall team. That made no sense as I had 10 years of seniority over all but one other person, had a proven track record, and was highly sought out by other teams as a SME during audits. I was also in a MBA program, thus bringing more value to the company. School is my saving grace. School is what will get me out of this toxic company and I am glad I finally decided to apply to grad school.",3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WWDE264,,0.0

This was a huge milestone in his development and I think It  should go down in history. Can’t wait to tell his mom when I see her later. It makes me so happy to see him grow up and reach these points. He is looking more like a grown-up every day as he begins to develop. I think he is ahead of the average child and so these things are very important in assessing his development and advancement because we want him to be at the top of his class.  These things are so important to me because family is so important to me and he is the most important part of my family. I have joys and sorrows vicariously through him and devote my life to making his better. I really want the best for him and life these things make me so happy because they show me that I’m succeeding in some importance. I think other people should find the same joy. I can’t wait until his next stage when he begins to run around And ride his bicycle or tricycle.

Our conflict seemed far from over, but it had only just begun. I was not in a great mood after the night before. As one could expect I was just the least bit withdrawn and didn't want to talk to them much. This caused her to get paranoid, defensive and triggered another torrent of angry, abusive behavior from her. What ensued was a fight where she said she would break up with me. Eventually I would have enough and called her out on her behavior. This only caused her to get more angry. She told me I was like an abusive parent. The next couple of hours were little more than narcissistic projection on her part. I was dumbfounded by her blatantly abusive and manipulative behavior. In the end she told me she wouldn't actually leave, but that she needed to 'take me down to my knees.' In her mind, she was knocking me off my high horse.

Lest I forget, that there are options that are outside of my own jurisdiction. Hard to imagine sometimes there is more to live than a 9-5. I'm thankful for my friends to introduce me to a location not like my own. We had amazing tropical drinks and delicious food too. I never thought I could be a part of something so great. There is good in the world. I think I'll come back sometime.",,3483FV8BEF5HSTKYKPJKTG2WW2E26I,0.0

Spending 4 days in the hospital was hard and scary, and I would prefer not having to do it again.  I have seen several doctors since getting out of the hospital, and have followed all of their instructions, taken my meds as prescribed, been to all my appointments and have tried to become much healthier.  Besides taking meds now, I have completely quit drinking alcohol, eat a lot better, and get more exercise.  I have lost close to 50lbs so far, and still have more to go.  I have a procedure on my heart that I need to get done as soon as I can get health insurance, which is my biggest hurdle at the moment.  I feel so much better than did a year ago, like a new man, and am dedicated to getting healthier and adding years to my life.  This was all very scary and shocking and I dont ever want to go through it again.  I have a lot of regret for living the lifestyle I lived in the past, and am making serious effort to live a better life.  For me, for my wife, and for our two daughters.  Ive completely changed my diet.  I have bought some exercise equipment and work out daily.  I am truly trying to get healthier and stronger.  I feel better now than I have in several years.  I never want to go through something like this, and I never want to put my family through something like this again.

This is defined as Atrial fibrillation (also called AFib or AF) is a quivering or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications. I also had liver problems. This diagnosis scared me very much and so I immediate began reading all the information I could and watching videos about the subject and immediately began making the necessary changes to my diet and lifestyle in attempt to reverse these symptoms I started exercising on a regular basis and improved my diet and when I went back the doctor the tests showed improvement in a short time and I was told to keep working at these changes and being consistent and so I did. I continued eating healthy and exercising on a regular basic and returned to the doctor every few weeks to check my progress and each and every time they said I am improving and to keep up the good work. I went home feeling hopeful. I then continued reading as much as I could and changed my diet to a much healthier almost 100% plant based with a few eggs from dads on occasion and Ive ordered some foods that I am unable to get at my local grocery store. I think the variety of foods is helping me and certainly the exercise I am getting is helping me feel more refreshed and I feel that I am in better physical shape than before I was diagnosed. This has changed my life and given me new hope. I have learned to eat different foods that I had not eaten before. This has changed my life and I feel younger than before. I have been discussing these changes with my doctor and with family and now several members of my family are asking me for recipes. We also plan on working together to grow more food this year as this will give us exercise and supply us with fresh foods. I have also located a CSA that I plan on joining as they deliver fresh food weekly from their farm in a large box. I also have been visiting the farmers market and have worked out a deal with a local grower to help them on their farm during the growing season in exchange for food and money.",,34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1FWIY5J,0.0

I had been really bummed since my dog of 15 years past away due to old age. I had been very depressed about my dog's passing and I thought it may be a good idea to adopt a new puppy. My family, especially my youngest son has been wanting another dog. Although it would be tough for me to take on the ""emotional"" responsibility of  having another pet, I feel that my son deserves to have a loyal pet, the same chance I had. Plus having a new puppy around is always super interesting, challenging, and FUN. This will allow me the chance to delegate and teach responsibility to my son. He is 11 now and I feel its time for him to take up some chores. This will also allow him to grow closer to the dog.. as I did with my previous pet. Seeing the new puppy brought joy to my family and my son was ecstatic. Truth be told I really got a little sad and I thought about Nova, my previous dog. Nova was great dog and we were really close. The new Puppy will soon take over as the family pet, but I will never forget Nova. She definitely made my life more interesting and enjoyable. I am very much looking forward to this new challenge and I believe that the spirit of my old friend will be part of this new dog.",,34FNN24DCNVBAADR8RGAAEP1HDKY5L,0.0

My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side. That's how I'm dealing with the aftermath of my eviction currently.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,,0.0

I started taking i because I learned that this naturally occuring compound is purported to be a highly beneficial compound with trong anti-oxidant and detoxification-supporting properties. The supplement is also used to support liver function and help alleviate neuropathy.  Upon taking recommended a dosage, I developed back pain. As a scientist, I began scouring medical literature as well as watching biomedical presentations. I began a intellectual journey in learning about the body's mechanisms for detoxification. One of the most important scientists to help educate me in this area was Dr. Christopher Shade, CEO of Quicksilver Scientific (a company that specializes in biological testing of toxins and supply of carefully formulated nutriceuticals designed to help promote detoxification.  Through Dr. Shade, I bean to understand the body;s complex and intricately choreographed mechanisms for identifying, tagging, mobilizing, and eliminating toxins from the body. In addition, I learned about environmental factors that could lead to a block in detoxification. In my case, my medical history and symptomology supported a block in detoxification created by a significant exposure to toxic mold. As it turns out, mold biotoxins can block the body's ability to clear a number of toxins, including heavy metals, and that without removal of this block, use of other methods that stimulate portions of the detox process (such as alpha lipoic acid), may be hindered.  This can put undue stress on the liver and kidneys.  Fortunately, Dr. Shade also was instrumental in recommending a simple dietary remedy to this mold toxin-induced block to detoxification. After a very short amount of time, my troubles were greatly diminished. I am grateful to Dr. Shade for his knowledge  and insight, which has enabled me to proceed in a lifestyle of detoxification as well as identify mold biotoxin as a source of many of my chronic health issues.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N,34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA7TD34N,0.0

A couple of months ago I decided it was time to get a new dog to see if it will help my depression. I went to the animal shelter to see if I could adopt a puppy. When I got there, there weren't that many left but I saw one that looked like the dog I had growing up. I immediately fell in love with that dog and knew it was the one I wanted and needed. From the very first day I took him home it made my mood so much better. It has made me so happy and I'm so glad I made that decision. I spend pretty much all day with that dog besides when I'm at work. When I go out anywhere I take him with me. It started hanging out with my friends more and being more social as well. Whenever I'm feeling stressed or depressed I would go take him to the park and it would make me feel better. We go out on walks a lot so I'm also getting more exercise as well.

We had practiced a lot online and in lan tournaments to prepare for the finale. Sometimes we would have time out members when some of us get tired and unfocused. I loved the memory because it my 2nd competitive scene match and it was my other friends very first match! We all were looking forward to this moment and what way to make it even better than to figure out it was for real money! Someone had hosted our match and put up $500 for the winners, split evenly of course. You can say there was more pressure but for sure it was nice to see our video game endeavors were finally paying off! My pro buddy didn't like how my other friend was brand new. He barely had any experience and he said he was going to cost us the match. I asked my pro buddy to give him a chance and to represent us! He said it was all up to me because I was the one who created the hosting. Fast forward game day, we had practiced for a while and were ready to play. Game starts and we are up a heavy lead (3 vs 6). We start choking and we lose the lead big time (6 vs 12). We start grinding and it of course becomes overtime for both the teams (15 vs 15). It ultimately goes to 1 vs 1 with my new friend being the last alive. He magically clutches it and we win the round and the prizepool of $500!",,34PGFRQONPXFS4XCIS2GQRNQFVFWJB,0.0

You hear of some fantastic revelation some day up on the mountain, or a close encounter with nature, even a brush with some insane disaster, bringing the person onto the doorstep of death. Most people quote extraordinary event that is very unique to them and hear about how that something have come to have a great impact on their lives, changing the very manner in which they view life and perceive it. You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound.",,34Q075JO1YZFPXGNZW3PFWI03GY014,0.0

She usually always harassed the other people in the kitchen but today she decided to harass me more than anyone else. I think why she disliked me the most was because I made it clear her behavior was unacceptable to me, while everyone else would just smile at her and than say terrible things about her when she left. She decided to try to bark orders at me, despite me being equal to her at work. She got so angry at me she would blow up at me before taking her break, and than while on her break she called the other co-workers in the kitchen to tell them to make sure I wasn't messing everything up for everyone else. She would threaten me, and berate me the entire day which my boss was entirely aware of. When I brought it up to my boss, just like I had done so dozens of times in the past, he just brushed it off and said to ignore her. I finally decided I had, had enough of my job and handed my boss my two weeks notice before leaving the building. He tried to guilt-trip me into staying by suggesting that a person with tough skin could handle it, and everywhere I go people like her would be there. However, I made it clear to him that in other work environments bosses enforce rules and if they're not followed the person is fired. My boss finally got the big picture of the problem with my co-worker and pulled her in to have a talk about her behavior, she came out quiet but proceed to be just as bad the next day. When you have a job where no one is ever fired, they never feel the need to change their behavior. When my two week notice was almost up, people kept telling me they would miss me and I was a good worker. That made me very happy, and made me feel like I had made a difference to people at my job. I think about that place sometimes but never do I miss it. While I hated to work there, I must admit it taught me a valuable lesson in dealing with others. My co-worker who harassed me left a week after I did, with my work asking me if I would come back shortly after. I of course, said no.",34PGFRQONPXFS4XCIS2GQRNQFVFJWY,,0.0

I greet him with all the affection in the world as he had been gone for three months already. The man who owns the house hears the fuss and comes outside. I thank him for finding my dog and taking good care of him but he insists that he had the dog for years and that I can't have him.

My wife and daughter had never been to the Rocky Mountains either, so it was sure to be a treat. We stayed with my wife's cousin and were there primarily to visit my wife's aunt. She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life. The first full day were were in Colorado we were taken to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range. My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was ""rescued"" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again. After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI,,0.0

We like to get out now and then, when our schedules cooperate together. After walking around some shops, we ended up bumping into a couple of our friends. At first, I wasn't too interesting on hanging out with them, but their moods were infectious. My wife had a hard time saying no as well, so it wasn't just me. Apparently they were all going to the state fair, and wanted us to go along. They made their cases about how we never see each other, and we agreed it had been quite some time since we had done something together. I kept double checking on the sly with my wife to make sure she was okay with it. Thankfully, she was. The fair turned out to be a lot of fun, and we all had a lovely time. We rode some rides, my wife won me a prize, which was funny. Afterwards, we decided to go to a local pub and have a few drinks. I just had a beer, and my wife had some wine. Then the karaoke happened, which I got out of. My wife, however, was a karaoke nut with one of our friends, and they sang a bunch of Taylor Swift songs. The bar was pretty slow, surprisingly, so we had the karaoke to ourselves. It was a blast.",,34T446B1C10ZC0QLFTS9WS1RYJ5C0P,0.0

I work with a lot of elderly people and I remember theirs names, their family, and things like that. One of my patients, whom I love dearly, has been getting sicker and sicker. She has been diagnosed with cancer and has not been responding to treatment well. Recently she has decided to stop with chemo and radiation because she doesn't want to spend the last few weeks of her life sick. It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. I felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much.

Her dress was barely touching the ground, yet her veil had a four foot train behind her. The whole ceremony only lasted about twenty minutes, and was well officiated by one of our close friends. After that, the wedding party headed to the banquet hall next door for a few drinks and appetizers. Luckily, it was open bar so I didn't have to pay for a glass of wine.

Each day lasted 8 hours, and we did get paid for it. But it was designed by a completely incompetent team. We didn't know how many months we would be working, how much we were getting paid, or even where we were working. Whenever we had a question that our supervisors didn't know, they would have call seattle, and wait for a half hour until they heard back from them. And the computer situation was also a mess. It took two entire days just to get our laptops that were given to us to use on the job, setup. It was entirely basic stuff like how to sign in, but we had to do it step by step, and could NOT skip ahead. Then when we had to do payroll, that took an additional two days just to teach us how to submit our time online.

I work in Vancouver and I have an exciting relative in the US who have always wanted me to come around. He told me a lot about New York where he stays and I have since then been wanting to have a view of the big city. So six months ago, after receiving my paid leave, I planned for my New York trip. I packed more than enough clothes as I can't be so sure which one I will feel like wearing. I had another suitcase for my shoes. I needed to show the world I can be very fashionable than that nerd they see on suit. In it was all sort of shoe type; sneakers, brogue, slip on, vans, boot. I booked a flight for New York and I printed the online invoice. Gave my dog to the neighbor for safe keeping till I'm back. Fast forward to New York, I had a nice stay there; the food, the city lights, the busy streets and all made it so much an enjoyable experience. I didn't know it was about to turn sour when on the day I was to leave for the airport and fly home, there was a heavy gridlock. The traffic was so locked that I silently prayed it should be free. I arrived at the airport some 10 minutes after the schedule time. I knew I have missed my flight to Vancouver. I walked up to the receptionist and explained my ordeal to her. She keyed into my plight as she understood it might cost me my job as I stayed a day to my resumption. She fixed me up to the next flight which wasn't a direct flight but will still take me to Vancouver. I was happy that such people still exist. She said ""You today, Me tomorrow"". That line will stick with me forever.",,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJXR1MGB,0.0

I was flying from Vancouver, Canada back to my hometown in New York. I was in Vancouver for a Spring internship that lasted four months. So needless to say, I was carrying a lot of stuff. I had two enormous suitcases and my carry-on backpack. Unfortunately, for me, I woke up late on the day of my flight. My flight was scheduled to leave at 6 am. I woke up at four-thirty and raced to the airport. Nonetheless, it was too late. I was stranded. I had already spent most of my money on rent and food during the internship. I didn't have a credit card, only a debit card with a purchase limit of $100 and $40 in cash. This was not enough to pay a new flight back to New York. I was sure that I was going to have to spend the night at the airport until I could get a hold of my parents. I told my story to a West Jet agent, I'll call Mike. Mike was a godsend. He spoke to his supervisor and pulled some strings to get me on the next flight back to NYC. I only paid $50 for the extremely discounted ticket. I was so happy and grateful. That was one of the few times in my life that I've seen someone truly go out of their way to help someone in need.",,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJXR1MGB,0.0

Even now, it still feels so surreal to me. Martial Arts was never something I saw myself pursuing professionally. My father owned a dojo, and as a child, I would spend a majority of my weekends training with him. I thought it was a mere hobby to me, more than anything, but my father had always told me that I had the talents to go further. I didn't take his advice, though. The amount of time I spent training, dwindled when I graduated high school and entered college. About a year ago, a friend of mine happened to stumble upon an ad on Facebook about the tournament and brought it to my attention. At that moment, I heard my father's words echo in the back of my head, and I decided to give it a shot! I trained hard for months. It was both the most difficult and rewarding period of my life. There were times where I was on the brink of giving up and dropping out of the tournament completely. At other times, I felt on top of the world and extremely confident. On the days leading up to my first match, I was very nervous. You have no idea how happy I was when I won. Hard work really does pay off! The entire experience was euphoric for me, and I realized that instead of a hobby, Jiu Jitsu, may have been a forgotten passion for me!",,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254ZIGJQW,0.0

It was so exciting to be chosen as the leader.  I have been involved with the church choir music for many years but knowing my peers though highly enough of me to choose me to lead it was really humbling.  I really worked so hard at preparing the music selections.  I tried to think of the events of the month and things that were going to be spoken about in the service.  I wanted songs everyone could relate to as well.  These were known songs and everyone there really seemed to enjoy it.  I met with the pastor as well as the other church members and reviewed the selections with him which he had no problem approving.  This suprised me as I thought I would have to tweak a few of them. They stated the selections were perfect and everything flowed well.  I felt so nervous that day but once I got there and saw my peers familiar faces I calmed down.  I took a deep breath and began the compositions.  The next thing I knew it was over. The event was over in a flash - its funny how things happen like that when you immerse yourself in something.  I was proud and humbled as I stated before that my talents were recognized and I was able to represent my church so well.  It was a wonderful day.,,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJ89WMGH,0.0

I finally found a BMW 328i close enough to ride my bike to see. I contacted the seller and made plans to see it that Sunday. I had been withdrawing cash every week to be sure I had enough to buy a car when I found one but I needed enough money in my bank account to cover the cost of insurance so I'd be able to drive it home. On Thursday I made certain to transfer the funds I needed well before the cutoff time. A little while later I got an email that the transfer failed. I found a reddit thread stating others were having the same problem. The withdrawal had to be done before about 5:00 or I knew it wouldn't be in my account. I tried throughout the day every 30 to 45 minutes or so hoping it would work. finally just before 4:30 the transfer finally went through. On Friday I checked my balance and found that instead of depositing my withdrawal once I had every single attempted withdrawal deposited to my account. I wasn't sure what to do since I now had over 400 extra dollars in my account and a negative balance in my Amazon payments account. I didn't know when the money might be taken out or whether they would only take the extra money or reverse it all and correct it with another deposit. The advice I kept getting was to not touch the money until it was figured out. I felt like I was in limbo and was extremely frustrated. I contacted the seller and told him I wouldn't be able to meet Sunday but if he still had it next weekend I would come get it. After a few days I finally received an email from Amazon confirming the error and that funds would not be removed from anyone's bank account. Unfortunately they weren't clear about what would happen to our Amazon payments account. I confirmed with the seller I would be able to come see the car that weekend and we set a time. One day I found the car was no longer listed and asked if it was sold. The seller replied that he had a flat tire he wasn't able to change and found the car had been towed from the apartment building he parked it at. My heart sank I felt a great opportunity had slipped out of my hands due to bad luck and felt a little bit hopeless about finding a vehicle. Amazon sent an email on Thursday stating the incorrect balance had been resolved and that the extra funds were ours to keep as an apology for the inconvenience I was completely floored that I just got a gift of over $400. A few days later I found a 525i that was listed for only a couple hundred more than the one I was planning to buy and it was a newer model by four years plus the interior looked new and the body was in pretty good condition with no major issues. After checking it over and test driving it I wound up negotiating with the guy for 100 less than the car I was previously going to buy so I wound up with $400 extra dollars and a car that was one model range up and four years newer for less money.,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VM5IT02,34Z02EIMITZGYHSW1FNZL21VM5IT02,0.0

It took a lot of work for me to get the day off and on top of that having both my kids and wife get it off too. Somehow I pulled off putting in the time off for it considering how busy I have been as of late. I had been being nagged by my wife for weeks before about the wine that she had wanted from a specialty store up state. Apparently this wine had been served at her birthday years before and it was important for her to have it. It took me all morning to get the kids dressed and ready for the day so when I got them all strapped in and ready for the drive to the winery of course 10 minutes in both of them would have to stop and go the bathroom! We pulled off into a fast food place and quickly took care of business.  As we got back onto the road our tire  popped and I had to quickly change the tire as we were getting down to the wire for being on time for the party. Finally we arrived at the winery and the lady at the front desk told me that the wine was going to cost $550!! I called my wife immediately and she told me that I had to get it and I was more than upset. After the morning I had had I tried to brush it off and we finally made it to the party with the wine as promised. We had a great time and so did the kids. My mother in law thanked us endlessly for the wine and said it had made her life! I'm glad it worked it and it was a memory to remember. Thankfully we will never have to buy that wine again! I will be having my wife do all those type of gift buying the next time.,,34YB12FSQZA9WQDX6KBQKGTJWVJGMU,0.0

They haven't spoken to me in some time and I don't quite understand why. I'm so confused because less than a month ago, we were fine, we weren't fighting or saying anything stupid. We were just existing and being best friends. I had a weird feeling just before they stopped talking to me, like something was off. I figured it was nothing and chose to ignore it. But now I'm convinced that it wasn't quite like that. They told me that they had been avoiding people and trying to just live, that they had been tired and busy all of the time. This makes sense, but I don't know when you stop being busy, or when you're too busy for someone you care about. I always figure it takes just a minute, even less, to answer someone's texts or to say, ""Hey, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, I'll let you know what's going on later."" It's bothering me so much. I'm stressing about it almost constantly. I can't get it off my mind. I'm really hurt, because I don't know how it goes from being best friends and always talking, to this. I don't know where that comes from and I also know I didn't do anything wrong, so what happened? I didn't say anything that I think would be offensive or taken the wrong way. Where does that friendship go? Where do you draw the line between always wanting someone around, to completely ignoring them and deleting them from your life?",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMVH7DMP,0.0

I knew that at some point, she would break a bone. That is exactly what happened.  She broke a bone in her wrist when  I wasn't there.  I was actually quite relieved when the hospital suggested rehab.  I hoped it would help strengthen her.  I also hoped that the rehab center would be able to convince her to use her walker, as I had been unable to do. She worked hard at rehab and was getting stronger.  She was never strong enough to go home, and she passed quietly in her sleep.  I had hoped that she would be able to come home again.

It's been bothering me so much that I haven't even been able to write about it here.  But now I think it's time...About 3 months ago my husband's brother, Jerry, came to stay with us at our house.  He told us he wanted to get off drugs, and that rehab didn't work and wasn't for him.  He'd been before and, obviously, it didn't work.  My husband is close with his brother so he, of course, let him stay with us.  I didn't think it was a good idea, but I supported the decision, even though I thought it might be dangerous to have a drug addict in our house. As I suspected, things didn't turn out well.  Over the course of a few weeks Jerry grew increasingly hostile as he detoxed.  He got really ill from the withdrawal.  I didn't realize it could take so long.  Anyway, he wasn't getting better, and he was getting meaner and meaner.  Everything came to a head when Jerry finally asked my husband to score some dope for him; Jerry was too incapacitated to leave the house and do it himself.  My husband erupted in anger, shouting at him about how we had opened our home to him, tried to help him get off drugs, not perpetuate his habit.  My husband physically threw Jerry out the front door and called the cops.  The police took him away for causing a scene, banging on our front door and yelling in the middle of the night. The whole thing--seeing Jerry get sick and mean, seeing my husband get violent--really unsettles me when I think about it, even now.

The funeral was two weeks ago. It was hard for me to cope with this because I was very close to him. We arranged the funeral and it was a beautiful ceremony, but it was an awful experience. Not only did I have to deal with the fact that he is gone, I also had to deal with my dad's shoveling of causes. After the funeral, something happened that caused people to leave said funeral in disgust and disdain. I had no idea what happened at first. My grandmother, who suffered quite a bit as a result of her husband passing, was approached by my father. I was being consoled for feeling like I was, but that didn't change the fact that my dad did this. He approached my grandmother, for what I thought was condolences. That would have been well and fine. Unfortunately, that wasn't what happened. I found out that my father took advantage of the fact that grandma was alone and away from people. He tried to convince her to join GLAD, and didn't even bother to feel the room out. I thought it was in really poor taste.",,352YTHGROWZ7SWJ2KMTCJMOKHAMH4E,0.0

We decided to go to Cancun , Mexico, and it was a fantastic experience. I loved the ocean and the white sand.  My kids had a wonderful time at the beach and I had a great time just relaxing myself sipping on a mango margarita. The most memorable experience is that we went to an event at Xcaret, where we attended to a performance about the Mayan Civilization. Our experience at the hotel was also very pleasurable. We had the all-included service and we loved it. Out hotel had 5 different restaurants ( Mexican, American, Chinese, Gourmet, and one with a mixture of all 5).  The service staff was friendly at all times, and we even received tickets for another attraction.  Our vacation in Cancun was the best we have had so far, and it helped us spend time together as a family. Cancun is just like a paradise, it has everything that we needed to have a great time as a family. When I saw my little twin boys smiling and enjoying the attraction I realized that it was an unforgettable experience for all of us. We have been to other places but for some reason we never truly loved the place, there was always something that didn't worked well, but in this case everything went great. I still believe that Cancun has everything that makes an unforgettable experience. I am planing to go back with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary (just the two of us) to enjoy a romantic dinner and enjoy the attractions for adults that we did not get to see as a family.",354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQHQ7003,354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQHQ7003,0.0

Her critical health condition did not surprise anyone as her health had been declining for months. On top of that she had dementia from mid stage Alzheimer's so she really didn't remember much of anything. The day she was admitted to the hospital she collapsed in her room at the nursing home. They rushed her to the hospital. The doctors said that she shattered the bone in her shoulder. They needed to operate on her. However, they knew that she probably wouldn't survive the surgery due to her fragile condition. They told us that she probably wouldn't live much longer. We should expect the worst. They fed her a steady supply of pain medications while we watched unable to do anything. My boyfriend, his family, and myself returned home to think about what happened. At four in the morning they called us to inform us that her heartbeat was getting fainter. We should return to the hospital if we wanted to say goodbye. So we all left gathering around her. As we said our goodbyes, she passed away. We all stood around crying. My boyfriend's uncle would be arriving shortly to check up on us. We went home afterwards and sat in silence. I found the whole thing depressing. Everyone else seemed to take it better than me. They told me that the person they knew and loved died a long time ago. She would continue to decline due to her dementia. At least she was able to pass before she progressed into late stage Alzheimer's. Regardless, it impacted me. My boyfriend hugged me as his mother cooked breakfast",,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFW1UGS7F,0.0

He had a hard time walking, he didn't have much energy, and overall he just wasn't doing good. Some days were better than others, but for the most part he was having more good days (at the time). He was 16 at the start of 2019, he would have been 17 in July 2019. I noticed around February 2019 that he wasn't eating his normal dog food, so I began looking for alternatives so he would be able to eat. I purchased various dog foods, from wet and dry and anything else I could find. Tried different meats like fish, chicken, beef and lamb. He would eat the new dog food that I purchased him for a few days and then all of a sudden stop eating it. It got to the point where I started making his own dog food in a desperate attempt to maintain his weight. But, as much as I tried, he just wouldn't eat as much as he needed to, or wouldn't eat at all. His eyesight was getting worse, to the point where he was almost completely blind. He went deaf when he was 14 years old, so it was breaking my heart watching him lose all of his senses. It was to the point where I was considering putting him down because his quality of life just wasn't there, but then he would have a good day and it would make me question myself. Not only that, I didn't want to put down my baby. He had been my best friend for 16 years and I wasn't ready to let him go. Just writing this now is making me cry. Anyway, he wasn't doing very well but he was still having a few good days here and there, but I noticed around March he was having more bad days at this point. Then, something worse happened. I don't remember if I went into detail my last diary entry, but it was bad. Blood was coming out places it shouldn't, and I knew it was time. My husband and I made an appointment and we put him down together, we stayed in the room the entire time. And yeah, I don't really have anything else to say.

He has failed to make any kind of payment in the last 3 months, not even child support.  The divorce has taken over a year to finalize. I don't see an end in site.  His attorney recently requested to be dismissed from his case.  I guess my ex thinks he is above the law.  We will see if he gets a slap on the hand this time.  He is of course, in contempt again.   We will have a trial scheduled.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHJS7G,,0.0

We had booked a trip to Punta Cana months before. We were really excited to go, however, some news had broken in the media recently that was kind of concerning to us. For the most part, we were able to relax and enjoy our trip, but it was always kind of at the back of our minds. We went on an excursion the last full day we were there. We decided to book a snorkeling excursion, and it was the first time I had ever gone snorkeling. I'm not going to lie, when I first got into the ocean, I started to freak out a little bit. There was a tiny bit of a learning curve when it came to learning how to use the mask and gear. But I was able to figure it out fairly quickly. It ended up being a fabulous excursion and I would love to try it again someday.  Overall we really enjoyed the trip and would totally go back someday. Maybe next time with our daughter. I think that the media has blown the news stories out of proportion a little bit to be honest. It as just a little concerning to be there while all the news was breaking. We never felt unsafe on the trip and never got sick at all.",3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ0JUGY4,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ0JUGY4,0.0

The entire experience was more emotionally moving than I anticipated.  It started with a very long labor for my wife who initially tried to go through labor without relief from drugs, and during this time she needed me more than ever.  I had to be strong, physically and emotionally, to help her cope.  Eventually she took the epidural and the labor became more of a waiting game.  But giving birth is every bit as complicated as it sounds, and we got to the point that it just wasn't progressing even with drugs given to speed up my wife's contractions.  As a result, she had to have a C section, a devastating result for her and I once again had to be stronger than I actually am and do my part to calm her down.  Once that beautiful baby was born, nothing else mattered.  She looked healthy and seemed to instantly bond to us.  I was scared for my wife who just went through a pretty serious surgery and at the same time wanted to give my full self to the little helpless human being.  Having family at the hospital was really a blessing, all so anxious to help and to see our little creation.  It also helped that the doctors and nurses were every bit as smart and helpful as we could have asked for.  The details of that day are permanently engraved in my mind.  The following days, which involved almost no sleep and horrible hospital food, are days that I wouldn't give up for anything.  Having the nurses there for support and questions was something we never wanted to give up.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWQB27S3,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWQB27S3,0.0

Now we're living in this horrible studio apartment and our new neighbors are up at all hours of the night. It sounds like they're constantly throwing a party.

I'm the kind of person that needs some space every now and again, and I'm starting to realize how clingy Tina has always been. I hope she starts working soon so we can leave this horrible apartment and neighborhood, but I think she might have given up. I feel like I'm forced to give an ultimatum.

I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.  I hope that I will not fail.",3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,0.0

I did not want him to be there. It was cold, he was going to freeze. I wanted to be with him, to keep him warm. I talked to my grandmother, trying my best to keep her mind off of this.

Finally, a pastor said a prayer and his casket was lowered into the grown with red carnations that were adorned on top. Tears were streaming down my face as the wind whipped at them.

We decided to renew our vows in front of family and friends. We wanted it to be a joyous occasion marked by love, fun, dancing, food, and great memories. We invited friends and family from all over the country to join us for dinner and dancing. It was a lovely weekend that everyone is still talking about!

I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.",358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8BVXR,358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8BVXR,0.0

The problem was that I didn't saved anymore. We used to go out every night, and started shopping some expensive clothes. I didn't asked my parents for more money, cause I would have been ashamed in front of them. So I made a decision. I knew I was the one to save my self. I started of having some debts from my cousins.

There was a lot of food at the fishing derby, hot dogs, burgers, macaroni salads, and much more, and I loved eating all of it. I might have even eaten too much during the event because I got a stomachache afterwards. But then I had to make room for dessert and I just couldn't resist the temptation of some amazing cake, even though I regretted the overfull feeling I felt later, if only a bit. Lots of my family members whom I don't get to see very often were there at the derby and I got to talk to them. I talked to my aunts and uncles and cousins and their kids, and it was nice being able to catch up with them. Some of my nieces and nephews had grown up a lot since the last time I had seen them, some were entering high school and others weren't little infants anymore, and were toddling and running about everywhere around the stock pond. There was a fishing contest for all the kids, which is why the event was called a fishing derby, where they all would fish and catch frogs from my aunt's stock pond. I didn't participate in the derby games because I'm a bit too old to do that anymore. Perhaps maybe my lack of participation in the contests might have just been because I don't really like how slimy fish and frogs feel in my hands. The kids all had some other contests for them to compete in as well, and I watched from the sidelines with the adults. During the frog race, the kids all picked one caught frog, and had to coax them to hop across a finish line the fastest. But a surprising thing happened during the frog race, one of the kids accidentally coaxed their frog to jump onto me and I might have panicked reflexively. But on the other hand I ended up kicking out my foot and flinging the frog over the finish line, making my little cousin the winner of that round. It was a fun event, with lots of laughs and a bunch of good memories for me.",35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS21XAVZ5,,0.0

Myself and my children ranging from 5 to 25 all drove together the 7 hours to his town. We visited him in the hospital and he was able to see and spend time with his family. I felt very emotional. I had so many regrets of the years he missed in mine and their lives. I felt fear. My father told me that he had been diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer. I saw all the hope I have always had that one day He would be a dad and grandfather disappear. I have spent my life filled with this hope that one day he will come and love me and be a dad.  We visited the next day and we came back home. The next week my dad was hospitalized again and then was being sent home with hospice. I set up care for my children and family, and I drove to my father. I brought him home. I got to spend one week, seven day in total with my father. I was his daughter. I was his caretaker. I now in detail every regret he has ever had, I know his pain, and he knows mine. I held my fathers hand and told him how loved he is and always will be. I was holding his hand as he passed away.

I did that, and was cycling home, when suddenly I heard a weird noise, and noticed some pain in my back. I didn't realize what was going on, and just then I saw a car driving next to me, and some ugly dark-skinned subhuman face looking at me. It was then that I realized that I had been shot, with something, and saw that this hideous mongrel chick was trying to shoot me again. I yelled at her, and reached for my own gun, and the cowardly spawn of liberals drove off because they don't fight with people who are able to defend themselves. They got away before I could defend myself. I then went to the liquor store for beer, and was able to verify that it was a paintball gun I'd been shot with. My backpack and clothes were covered with the junk. My back hurt pretty good, and when I left the liquor store I cycled around for a bit to see if I might run into those beautiful brown skinned children of Obama again, but there was no such luck. I went back to my place, and looked in the mirror, and there was a nice golf-ball sized dent in my back where I'd been hit, surrounded by a big red welt. Liberal social justice had been served tonight. Cheered up by this realization, I had my beers and iced up my back, and tried to get over the whole thing, realizing it was inevitable as part of the progress that modern society needs to march forward bravely into the beautiful new era of liberalism.  Despite this, I resolved to be more ready to get my gun out in the future. I also decided to save up money for a longer range firearm in case preventive measures become necessary at some later date.

I woke up at about 9:30 AM in the morning and my mother handed me a birthday card. On the card it said, ""I have an amazing son... who knows who he is and what he wants. Tells it like it is and lives his own truth."" The guitar had a bright red guitar logo on it. I felt that this meant a lot to me since I love rock and playing guitar. My mother put a lot of thought into this card and knew exactly what I wanted. It made me feel very motivated. I felt very appreciative of this card, following that she took me to the movies to go see Godzilla. I felt very appreciative of this, because Godzilla is one of my favorite franchises. She even bought me popcorn. Though, initially the popcorn was stale a fact I bought up to her she suggested that I go and get another bowl. I went to get a fresh bowl of popcorn made and it was delicious. It was warm and buttery. After we finished watching the movie I thought that it was alright and decent. My mother liked it a little more than I did surprisingly. I felt that there was a bit little too much focus on human characters that weren't necessarily all that interesting in my opinion. The final fight was alright, but it needed a bit more focus on the monsters, there isn't much human characters can do and also a lot of the humor was awkward and fell flat. A lot of the characters in the movie felt pointless and unnecessary. Following that she took me to go and get some Indian food. I really appreciated that, because Indian cuisine is my favorite. The food that day was particularly delicious. I had a short conversation with some people next to me, but I don't really think my intrusion into their conversation was all that welcomed. It was a fun day all and all and I had a lot of appreciation for my mother and her taking me to the movies.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J028Z37,0.0

I was on the way back, and I noticed a car driving slowly next to me, and I heard a couple of sharp cracks, and I was startled, I thought maybe a tree had fallen or something. Very quickly I noticed a sharp pain in my back, and while this was going on,  I noticed one of the people in the car was leaning out the window staring at me. I saw her ugly brown face staring at me, and saw she was holding something. As it turned out, it was a paintball gun, and was still shooting at me. This 'disadvantaged' ethnic minority type had just injured me, but not badly enough, she wanted to shoot me in the face or something, so maybe I'd fall off my bike and get hurt real bad, as some form of liberal social justice. Well, I stopped my bike, and reached into my fanny pack to my own gun, a real one, and they quickly sped up their car and drove away. I considered taking a shot at them, but I realized it was unlikely I'd hit them, and so I decided against it. I was in a decent amount of pain by this point, but I decided to take a detour to the liquor store instead of going straight home, picked up a 6 pack of beer, and had the people at the store tell me how much paint and crap were on my shirt, and backpack.  As it turned out, my backpack had absorbed most of the shots, so it was the article of clothing that was most paint-soaked. I got my beer, and painfully cycled home. When I arrived I took off my backpack, and shirt, and observed the injury in the mirror, it was like there was a golf ball sized dent in one of the large muscles of my back, and a nice fist sized red mark surrounding it. I put some ice on the injury, drank my beer, and tried to sleep, though it really hurt. Since then, I've been more cautious about passing cars, and bystanders in general, and I've practiced getting out my gun more quickly in case something like this happens again. I've also thought about it a lot, if someone assaults me in a similar way in the future, am I prepared to respond to them with lethal force? The answer to that is yes, I only suffered a minor injury but if things had happened a bit differently I could have been hurt very badly, and it's only right, that surrounded by people who will hurt me badly for no reason at all, other than some vague ethnic/identity/liberal ideology, I have to be prepared to hurt them first, to protect myself, at all times.",35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8ZUY3XT,35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8ZUY3XT,0.0

This was  a routine visit where they put her under anesthesia and clean her teeth.  As soon as I arrived back home I was contacted by the vet.  she proceeded to tell me my dog's lymph nodes were enlarged. I had no idea what this meant.  She proceeded to explain to me that it doesn't mean anything good. there's something wrong with my dog. Her lymph nodes are working hard and that's why they are so enlarged.  She suggested I get a find needle aspiration done to her lymph node to have it tested right away.  I had to wait a few days only to find out it was inconclusive.  I had to bring her back in for minor surgery so they could pull a piece of lymph node out and test the tissue.  One full week later and a lot of worry and sleepless nights I get a call. she's not sick.  She doesn't have cancer. She has a rare deformity that even the vets can't even explain fully. I was told it doesn't mean anything bad.  I've never felt so relieved in my life. One of the best days ever.,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J1ERZ3F,0.0

I was surprised to see his name come up on my phone - I haven't seem him since high school. He knew that I was a aspiring photographer that was looking for gigs. When he told me that he was engaged and wanted me to take pictures for a secret wedding, I was jumping up and down on the subway train. My first solo gig was going to be for a friend's secret wedding! I prepared for weeks, taking many as many practice shots as I could. My friend and his wife was gorgeous on that day - it was just me, them, and their families. It was a great honor for me to be their photographer, and the wedding was held at a wedding venue filled to the brim with bright lights. It was every photographer's dream - to take pictures in such an grand environment. My friend and I did a lot of catching up - after high school, he went to college where he majored in actuarial science, and is now a successful accountant. I thanked him for giving me this opportunity. The food was great - everyone was served beer and lobster. I took hundreds of photos that day. Everyone had a great time.

I went out walking the night before but I went in the direction of the Forbidden City to see how far it was. In the morning I turned east, in the opposite direction. I wanted to see what lay down that direction. The traffic was already loud on the road, a six-laner crowded with trucks and cars. Bicycles too filled the bike lane and some riders came up on the sidewalk so I had to avoid them. I passed a lot of upscale businesses, western clothiers and jewelers. Then I came to an intersection with another wide road. It actually passed overhead in a raised highway. In the shadow of the over pass, at one corner, a police van was parked and some officers were watching the traffic. Quite randomly they waved certain bike riders over to the curb and began questioning them. The police made the riders produce papers, which they examined. They made the bike riders wait quite a while. One older man just sat on the curb and threw up his hands and started smoking a cigarette. I watched this go on quite a while. There seemed no rationale for the riders who were pulled over and those allowed to go past. I walked back to the hotel and began an email to a friend, telling about what I had seen.

I think a part of me knew that it was coming the day before. She was acting off and wasn't interested in much. I had made the decision that if she didn't improve in a day I would have her euthanized. The morning it happened I woke up and she had thrown up on the bed. She perked up for a little while and I placed her on her bed on the floor to spend some time with her before I called the vet. I held her head on my lap and pet her. This day was also the memorial service for my uncle that had just passed away. So I was home alone. It seemed like it happened so quickly. One moment she was there. And then the next moment she was gone and I was cradling her head on my lap sobbing uncontrollably.

I was in my mid 30s and all my friends had already started to settle down. Some had even married and started families. I was becoming the odd one out still being single and no kids. Add to that I was just really beginning to get a good foothold in my career. As I saw it, I needed to propel myself forward significantly in 2019 if I wanted to feel like I was progressing and not becoming “life stagnant”. So I took upon myself to get out from renting a small apartment nearby work and took the leap of faith to home ownership. I should have done this a few years ago.  I think what held me back was the fear of the whole process, but with the realtor I found and the information on the web I researched, it wasn’t as painful as I anticipated.  It was honestly easier than all the troubles that I’ve been through over the years with renting. Some of those troubles were bad building managers, terrible neighbors, and sketchy areas I’ve lived in.  Now I feel like I’m putting down roots in my community and making a solid plan of moving forward. I'm glad I finally took that leap of faith. Too many times I questioned myself and my motivations. In the long run, there was nothing really much to fear. Having those keys in my hand really made me feel like a grown-up. And also, now my parents can also get off my back about not “growing up”.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0JJ7V3ZR,0.0

I tried to make sure that Clara didn't have to deal with everything and could just enjoy her day. First, Mom was so fussy. She wanted things to go perfectly for the guests, but I just wanted the couple to be happy. The the wedding officiator not coming until the last minute was worrisome. But we were surrounded by people who love us, so really if we didn't have the officiator until late, it wouldn't mean that things were SO BAD. But by the way Mom was acting, you'd think the world was ending. Henry and Clara love each other, we are here to celebrate, and it was beautiful. I wish people didn't get so stressed about weddings. When I get married, I hope it's relaxed and everyone is happy and not stressed. The speech I labored over went over extremely well! People laughed and cried, and I felt closer than ever to my little sister. I loved the wedding.

She read online about the train going down to California.  It was highly romanticized but it did look nice.  We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery.  It surprised me that the food was so good.  However, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met.  When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story.  The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them.  In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once.  It was really amazing.  One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies.  One couple was from the phillipines.  One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.  There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story.  Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story.  We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal.  Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close.  This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close.  But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me.  What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband.  It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.  Yet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever.

The day started as any normal day but it was full of events. Of which at the morning hours i had no idea whats gonna happen later. But briefly what carried my feelings on that day its the time i looked at her eyes and listen to her read her vow. I had that feeling that i have been looking for since then. That's the feeling i had for that one day it still fresh in my mind. Since then we are too used to each. We have never planned for another wedding even though it will never be the same.

I was under the assumption that it was just going to be me and my immediate family. A few days before my birthday my older sister said that she made a reservation for 10 at a local restaurant that I love. We were suppose to meet at the restaurant at around 6 PM. My boyfriend and I drove to the restaurant and we were walked to a back room in the restaurant that is for reservation. I figured something was a little off when they were taking us to the back room. When we walked in the room I was surprised to see my family and a bunch of my friends and coworkers. Apparently my sisters did a surprise party. There was about 100 people in that back room. They hired a DJ and the restaurant catered the food. I was so excited to see everyone and was happy to know that they all cared about me. We had so much fun. We danced the night away. I could not believe that my sister did this without me know.,35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYPX8EFP,,0.0

It just hung above my head. I didn't want to spend the rest of my day at the gas station. I wanted to head home. Despite fearing greatly for my personal safety, I decided to chance it. I drove through the flooded streets. I was doing OK, perhaps just a couple of minutes away from home, when the visibility dropped to nothing. The rain was coming down so hard that I couldn't even see through my windshield. Eventually, my car stopped and, unexpectedly, caught fire. I grabbed my phone to call 911 only to notice that I had no signal. I got out and went to the graveyard to look for cover. Luckily, I found a porch and something unexpected - my friend, Carl. He was spending the day visiting his grandmother's burial plot when the storm hit. We struck up a conversation, and he handed me his phone so I could call someone about my broken down, burning car. At that point, it seemed like everything was going to be fine.",,35K3O9HUACZ562PPE2HPPNOYYSBFES,0.0

Finally, we were able to find a free weekend for both of us and booked everything very last minute. We started off getting dinner at an Italian restaurant  with her parents, which went really well!

Saturday I did not think we had any plans, but I was surprised that my girlfriend had a whole day planned out. I was surprised and happy she spent the time to plan a whole fun day for me. We spent the day going to museums, breweries, parks, and ending the day riding a tram up a mountain for a view of the city, and ate dinner up there. It was a really fun day and the whole thing made me really happy. The next day, we went to a Pittsburgh Steelers game. The stadium was really cool and it was an exciting game. The fans of the Steelers were so passionate and enthused it made the experience very memorable. After the game, we drove home - I drove while my girlfriend slept. It was a tiring weekend as we had a lot of activities, but it was great nonetheless.",,35LDD5557BQEYC9GWBW5I8LCFWLKM2,0.0

There were things out of my control. I tried to reel us back in as best as  I could. but sometimes expectations exceed reality. We were running a course that I just could not seem to correct. Management wanted us to make changes. We explored those changes in the workgroup. But it seems those changes just are not feesible. We tried coming at it a different way, but this ship was doomed.

My friends were performing songs off of a new mixtape that they had just released. Everything was going well into a group of about 5 or 6 people rushed through the front door in a very aggressive way. I was sure what the problem was but it was enough to take the attention off of my friends. After careful observation, it dawned on me. One of the members of the group was the ex of one of my friends. They broke it off a few months prior and the ending wasn't pretty. I decided to take matters into my own hands and boo them out of the building. The crowd started to get into it as well with a few boo's of their own. Unfortunately, the group didn't care and continued to ruin the show. My friends were pissed and the concert was eventually shut down. I felt pretty bad. It upset me that there was nothing I could do about it. After we all went home, I received a call from an old friend in Brooklyn. He told me that every member of the group was arrested a few miles from the event for a DUI. I didn't mean to laugh but I couldn't help it. I told my friends and we all laughed together. I was relived.

This launched my media page from 400 to 530 likes practically in 2 days. This was a big confidence boost for me. I wasn't ready to give up but with all the obstacles that I face this year i felt like I was gonna be left behind.  Ironically this videos lead to me getting into tracks for free.

I was with my mother and her partner that day. When I arrived at the beach it was very hot and humid outside but when I walked out on the beach it cooled down because of the ocean breeze. The beach was clean but very crowded. I found a spot and laid out a towel on the sand. There were many broken seashells on the beach. There were several tide pools on the shore. When I walked along the beach I looked in the tide pools and noticed baby crabs. There was also an adult crab I tried to catch it but it ran away.  This is memorable because I rarely ever get to go to the ocean and I always enjoy the time I spend there.  I remember walking along the beach and seeing dolphins far out in the ocean.  I remember getting in the water and feeling how cold it was. I spent about two hours there before going home. The most memorable part of my trip was seeing the dolphins from afar. It is rare that I ever see dolphins in the ocean at New England because I don't usually see much sea life at this particular beach.",3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQ9LVIF0,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQ9LVIF0,0.0

Upon arrival my mother had to pay for parking but we found a nice spot right near the beach.  We were also near the restrooms, which was great because I had to take a piss really bad. When I got in the bathroom I was surprised how clean it was given it was a bathroom on a beach.  I was also shocked how bright it was in the bathroom because I did not like seeing myself that clearly in the mirror when I went to wash my hands.  We walked along the beach and I looked for seashells but there were only tiny pieces of broken seashells along the shoreline. I got my feet in the water and it was very cold!  So I didn't go in any further, just continued to walk along the shoreline looking ahead when I spotted a couple dolphins swimming together. I saw a few kids on a boogie board in the water and laughed to myself because I thought about how they might get caught in an undertoe or get eaten by sharks.  It was surprising because it is a rare site in New Hampshire as the water is always too cold to see animals up close. I continued walking and we happened upon several small tidal pools which felt really warm when I stepped in them.  They were in front of a bunch of rocks.  There were many baby crabs in the tidal pool, about the size of a thumbnail. I also spotted a crab running away from the tidal pool. Later in the afternoon we got hungry so we left and stopped at McDonald's to get a hamburger for lunch.  Overall I really enjoyed my day and wish I could go back.",3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQ9LVIF0,,0.0

Technically it is not an actual dog park, and all dogs are supposed to be on a leash while there, but in practice nearly everybody lets their dog run free because the park is mostly just one big field lined with trees. There is a baseball diamond at one corner for kids, but that is about it. On this occasion I had my dog on her leash because I could see at the far end of the park that there was a lady walking her dog on a leash as well, and it would be rude to let my dog just run free and approach her. When we got closer to each other, I said hello and the dogs were of course quite happy to meet each other and curious about their respective scents. We talked for a while about breeds and ages and so forth and she told me about her dog's tumor, which was actually visible from his side. He was getting a bit older and it is somewhat common for fatty tumors to form, though they can turn out to be malignant when checked via biopsy by a veterinarian. He was scheduled to be checked soon and I expressed my concern and empathy for her worry, since my previous dog (who died a few years back) also had to have a tumor checked and removed towards the end of her life. It was somewhat reassuring for her to hear that my dog's tumor was not malignant and was simply a fatty tumor which could be removed by surgery. She of course hoped to receive the same diagnosis when going to the vet. We said goodbye after about 5 or 10 minutes of chatting, and the next time I saw her was a month or two later. Her dog had a patch of stubble in the area where the tumor had been removed and thankfully it had not been malignant. I knew that he was an older dog and would probably not be in good health for too much longer, so when I told her about CBD dog treatments it was with not just surgery recovery in mind. That type of treatment can help older dogs with a whole range of issues, and my younger dog even used CBD dog treats for help with her hip issues stemming from an injury. Since I carry a lot of my dog gear in a big plastic bin in the trunk of my vehicle, I went and got out the half-full bag and showed it to her. She was very interested in the positive results I had seen, and I felt so much sympathy for her dog that I spontaneously offered to give her the rest of them since I could just order some more online. The gesture was accepted graciously, and I felt like I did something good to alleviate the feeling of sadness I had for witnessing the suffering of her older dog. I have chatted with her a couple of times since then and it is too painful for me to point out that although her dog is doing good now post-surgery, he likely only has a couple of years left to live in the best-case scenario.",369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX7SHG6S,,0.0

We started telling stories from our past and this really set us off to laughing. It felt so wonderful to be able to laugh with her. I was a bit annoyed that it took her longer to get ready. It's the one thing that really bothers me because I like to stay on a schedule and she just doesn't seem to understand that. But all in all, it was a great day.  The laughter felt really good for my soul. I hadn't been able to laugh like that for quite some time. I have been so busy with work that I haven't really taken a whole lot of time to help her get the things done that she needs to get done. But I finally got a day off and we spent it together. I have missed her friendship. We do text but it isn't the same as seeing each other face to face. Being able to see facial expressions and listen to the tone of her voice. I like to be able to read people as I am talking to them. Body language is just as important as being able to hear someone's voice. And when I am with her, it is like we have never been apart. It seems we are always able to read each other's minds and pick up right where we left off. In this day and age, to many people rely on technology. All you see is people playing on their phones instead of communicating. Communication, and I mean true communication, is being left behind. This is why me and her can just talk and talk. Because we were both raised to communicate the proper way.",,369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWXI86G6O,0.0

She was about 25 or so and her children could not have been more than a few years old each. She was young but had the weathered look of someone who was struggling a bit. Her kids were driving her crazy and I could tell she just wanted to get home. Anyways as she is going to pay she sticks her credit card into the machine and it's declined. She tries another card and it's the same result. Again and again for what seemed like an eternity. This lady with her two kids and a cart full of groceries was holding up the line and I could tell things were going to come to a head. She finally breaks down and starts weeping. I felt so terrible but as I'm on a budget I was not in the position to help. Finally after about a minute the cashier swipes his card and says ""don't worry mam, I know how it feels like to struggle."" There had to be at least a hundred or so dollars worth of groceries and I'm sure this cashier wasn't getting paid much more than $10 an hour. To take your days pay and to help out a stranger was one of the most touching things I've seen. She gave this cashier a big hug and she went about her day. I felt good about the human race for the entire day after that.",36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4L4IOJO,36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4L4IOJO,0.0

There wasn't much time in the day that I was taking to relax or reflect, and it was really starting to wear on me. I had just piled on more and more deadlines at work, thinking that I could do it all, but I was wrong. I was starting to get fatigued, and my work was suffering because of it. I was having an especially bad night, and I wanted to just give up, but I had a friend over who wouldn't let me. She told me that I needed to keep going, and basically that she believed in me, and in my ability to finish what I started. She told me that I was the hardest worker she knew, and that I was inspiring to her. She said that if I gave up, it would let her down, and that she knew I wouldn't let her down. That really helped, and it really touched me that she felt that way about me. It wasn't quite enough, though, as I was still very burned out. She told me to take the night off, and while I was relaxing, she went out and bought some things. She bought us some good food for dinner, as well as some nice wine to enjoy after.  Then, she cooked me dinner, which was really good. After that, we just relaxed, listening to music and drinking wine, not having any care about work or deadlines. It was only one night, and it didn't solve the issue of being burned out, but it did give me some more fuel to keep on going and finish my projects. I am really thankful that she did that for me, and I am lucky to have her as a friend.",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4UMYD7,0.0

My husband was running late and texted me that he would be there in about ten minutes. We waited for a while, listening to the radio in the car, and everything was fine for about seven or eight minutes. Then I heard a loud engine in the distance. My son heard it too, and commented on it. After a while the noise grew louder and eventually the car was close enough that I could see it coming. The car was speeding and veering around, so I quickly realized the driver was drunk. My son and I sat in silence, hoping that this reckless driver would pass by without causing any problems for us. Unfortunately that was not the case. Just as the car was passing us, it started spinning wildly. This happened so suddenly that neither of us had time to react. I had parked the car next to a light pole because I thought it would make it easier for my husband to find us in a bright spot. That light pole may have saved our lives, because the spinning car hit the pole and stopped instead of hitting our car. My son and I were both so shocked that we didn't say anything for a while. Eventually we got out of the car to check on the driver, who also got lucky and only had a few minor injuries. My husband arrived just as this was happening, and ran to the scene of the accident. He was relieved to find out that we were okay, and I was glad that he hadn't arrived a bit earlier when he could have been hit by the car. I called the police to report the accident, and we had to wait at the scene so that they could get our reports of what happened. Once that was finally done, we were able to go home and relax after that frighteningly close call.",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4U7YDS,0.0

It was the first time that we ever went on a vacation where we focused on ourselves and relaxing. We usually would go on trips to visit extended family so this was a time we could be indulgent with our time and money. We rented a car and went all across korea. It was amazing. My family bonded very closely there. We talked a lot, laughed a lot, and made a lot of memories that I will never forget. I learned more about my parents and their story before they had me. It transitioned us to this new phase in our lives where my brother and I are no longer children but adults along with them. We took a lot of pictures also. We made an album from it. We have it playing on repeat in our dining room. We look at those pictures as we eat and remember fond memories. My grandma also went with us. She talks about the trip every time we call her.

It was kind of unexpected, but I haven't seen her much in the last few years so I was excited. We were headed to a wedding about 6 hours away. I didn't really know the guy getting married, but I had met his mom a few times. On the way to the wedding, we stopped to visit several relatives. Again, people I hadn't seen in years. It was so fun to catch up with all my cousins! We had a blast at the wedding, or rather, the wedding reception and dance! Now that was a good time. Everyone was out on the dance floor and most of them were very good dancers. My aunt and I didn't participate in that, but it sure was fun watching everybody out there. The food was good too! After the dance, we headed back to another friend's house to spend the night. I had met him a few times before, and we spent a couple of enjoyable days with him. We spent a few more days visiting with more friends and relatives before we headed back. I absolutely had a blast. We talked all the way there and back which was about a 12 hour round trip. This is my favorite aunt of all time, and I'm so glad she asked me to go with her. She is over 70 now, and doesn't get around as well as she used to, so I soaked in every moment of our time together. I only wish it could've lasted longer, but unfortunately, I had to get back to work. I hope we get the opportunity to do another road trip together!",,36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31Q3ZSFJW,0.0

Upon arrival to Portland, we got our baggage from baggage claim and ordered a Lyft. Our Lyft driver picked us up, and we directed him to our hotel in downtown Portland. Once we told our driver where our hotel was located, he informed us of the protest that was occurring near our hotel. He informed us that liberal protesters, members of a group named Anti-Fa, and members of Gay Pride groups were violently protesting near where we were staying. He assured us that this was normal for Portland. After our Lyft driver dropped us off we entered into our hotel and walked to the front desk. The front desk attendant reiterated the ongoing protests. My Wife and I got to our room, and opened the windows in time to see trucks carrying officers from the Department of Homeland Security speeding down the street toward the protests. News stations on the television were also covering the protests. Later my Wife and I left the hotel, in another Lyft in the opposite direction from the protests. By the evening the protesters had left. The very next morning, My Wife and I walked to the site of the protests, and it looked as if nothing had happened. We ate our breakfast from a food truck, sitting the in the very square where the protests had occurred only hours before.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QT3XJF3,,0.0

This was the year of my graduation from university. I could not believe that I spent the last five years of my life working towards this day. During my time in university, I met many people of different backgrounds. Because of this I learned about many different cultures and became more culturally enriched myself. What makes this significant is the path it led me on today. Thanks to the many great people I collaborated with during university, I received an opportunity to work for a great company that embraces and supports diversity. The day of graduation is one that I still remember as if it was just yesterday. The feeling of accomplishment, but also some sadness still lingers on until this day. During my last year, I got realy close to some people which is unusual for me. Many of the people I interacted with during my schooling were what i would consider acquaintances. However, these people I met I could actually call my friends. The reason for my sadness is that I knew that once I graduated, I would most likely not keep in touch as mcuh as we did before. In the end, we all went to school for one reason, to get a nice paying job. We didn't really go to school to meet new people; at least that what it felt like. Anyways, the biggest thing I take away from this day is that all good things must have to come to an end at some point. I was counting down the days to graduation because I knew once it was over, that there would have to be a big change in my life; something I always feared. Most people would describe their graduation day with feelings of relief, happiness, and accomplishment. For me it was a bit different, almost the opposite. While the friends I made was probably the best part about going to school, would it even matter 5 years from now? Im glad that as of now everything seems to be going well and my work has paid off. What saddens me is that I will never get to live those moments again like if it was the first day it happened.",,36TFCYNS45WYQY7C4XVHGXLIUDGXHY,0.0

My parents told me that I couldn't have one for years and years, but getting my pet bunny in a magic show two months ago was so cool! The magician made a rabbit disappear and then reappear under my seat, and they let me adopt it after the show! My mom originally gave me a dirty look, but she couldn't say no to that cuddly little face. They even let me and my mom meet the magician and other assistants backstage. They did a pretty cool trick for me with a red ball that they didn't do during the show. My mom was blown away! When we got home my dad wasn't exactly thrilled about the bunny, especially since the little guy pooped on the kitchen floor right when we walked in. I had to clean it up, which was pretty gross. My parents told me they were happy that I was being responsible. The next morning we went shopping for supplies at the local pet store. Mom and dad were pretty cool about it too, and let me pick out a nice cage, a bunch of specific food, and some toys. The cage I got is massive and has multiple spots for food trays, which is perfect. It's just so funny how my parents always said I wasn't responsible enough to have a dog or a cat, and now I have a bunny. I'm just glad they came to their senses!",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JE3PYKG,0.0

I was packing some boxes when all of a sudden it hit me. My chest got really tight, and my breathing went crazy. I couldn't see straight, and I started freaking out. My husband asked me what was wrong but I couldn't talk, all I could do was shake my head and clutch my chest. My husband called 911 and the paramedics arrived and checked me out. They gave me oxygen and checked my blood pressure. One of them told me it was ok just try to breathe normal. Finally, things started letting up and I was breathing normal again. I started crying and told the paramedics how sorry I was that he had to waste his time to come out. He assured me it was all a part of his job and that he thought I was having an anxiety attack. I felt embarrassed but he assured me it was nothing to be ashamed of and I needed to get things under control or it could lead to worse things like a heart attack.

I was in my living room when this happened and my wife immediately started helping. She asked me to name 5 objects around, the room, then 5 colors. This helped me focus and get myself back under control. This was a triggering event to make me realize I needed to stop ignoring my mental health issues and seek help. So with the encouragement of my wife, I went to see my family Doctor. I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. My family doctor recommended medication, which was also a trigger for me, as I had a lot of misconceptions about taking medication for mental health. I felt like it would make me weak. Though I did eventually try the medication and it helped me immensely. All my physiological reactions went away. I also decided that day to seek out therapy.",,36W0OB37HX0NVT7R5FJ2DI1T2DSZHB,0.0

The weather was a little bit cooler than at home, which was nice to get away from the summer heat. We had never taken our daughter camping before so I was not sure how well this was going to work out. Turns out she really likes it! When we arrived we found our camping spot and unloaded our gear. L helped us set up the tent, which went better than expected. I thought for sure we would have problems getting it set up. but all the poles were accounted for and getting it pitched was easier than I remembered. After setting up our tent, we made sure to secure our food so as that any creatures would not make a snack of it. That goodness for locking coolers. After getting our sleeping bags and foam mats squared away we went down to the river to wade around a bit. You would think water in July would be warmer but boy was it cold. Not for being one for fishing, we looked for pretty rocks  in the crystal clear water and then headed back to camp to start the fire for cooking dinner. We roasted hot dogs on sticks and made smores for desert. Turns out she really like s her marshmallows burnt. Takes after mom I guess. We still had a good bit of day light left so  L went to play with a group of kids with a family that was also camping until it was getting to dark to see. Then the fire flies came out. We spent the evening looking at the stars and the fireflies until it was time for bed.

I had lived in my college town for a year after graduating, and in total I had lived there for 6 years. It's a small town, and all of my friends and people I knew had moved away. I finished a music degree and had applied to some graduate programs because I didn't know what else to do. Luckily, I did not get in to any program, and I felt an immense sense of relief when I was forced out of this path I had made for myself. Thought I was relieved, I didn't know what to do with myself, and I quickly fell into a rut. I felt very mentally and physically stuck in a place that started feeling foreign to me. I made the decision to move to a new city, and I saved enough to make a deposit on an apartment. I spent weeks packing all of my belongings, and this was particularly stressful because I was also dealing with a mouse infestation. I rented a truck and put everything inside, then drove to my new home. I was scared of leaving a familiar place and moving somewhere where I didn't know anyone or even have a job yet. After I unpacked my belongings into the new apartment, I returned the truck and went to the grocery store. Even that felt foreign to me since I had been going to the same few in my small college town for years. I got enough food to eat for a while and went home to make dinner. The new apartment and new city didn't feel like home, but my old town definitely didn't either. I felt a lack of belonging on that night, and though it was scary, it was very liberating to not be surrounded by old attachments and memories. I felt free from some old patterns and able to start fresh. This was the first move I had made on my own.",373ERPL3YPU4YBCVVS6E5Y2ISCSTR6,373ERPL3YPU4YBCVVS6E5Y2ISCSTR6,0.0

I'd known my best friend since we were pre teens, and this was the first time they had met.  It went really well! I'd been dating him for nearly a year, and it'd taken quite some time for our schedules to line up. I think this delay in meeting gave me some pent up anxiety about it finally happening. My friend texted me asking if I'd like to get dinner, and I let her know that I was with my boyfriend at the time.  We got burgers and wings at a place nearby.  The food was great, but the company was better.  We ended up seeing a couple people that my friend and I knew.  When we finished eating, we spent some time speaking to them. It was nice to catch up with old friends. Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog. Seeing them interact was adorable, since my dog is a senior and doesn't quite play as much.  It was great to spend time with two people I value and care about, and to see them getting along so well.

Treated them to dinner at times and took them to ice cream, also.  The days I took them to swim practice, I was able to go off  to McDonald's or shopped at Home Depot until their practice was over. Otherwise, I would stay and just play games or do a little work on my phone. Carowinds was a great time for all of us. Even though I don't care for rides much anymore, I did do some for them.

Initially I was supposed to be in the hospital for only 3 days. This stint in the hospital ended up being for 6 days. The first day I arrived there to stay overnight, the chemo was not ready to be delivered so I had to stay there for the night for really no reason, away from my wife and daughter. The next day I had to get a CT scan that shouldn't have happened and they had initially thought that they found more cancer in my lungs. We now know that this diagnosis is not correct but it added to the trauma of this visit. Several doctors visited us and said that they wanted to potentially open my chest and take a biopsy of my lungs, NOT GOOD! Once my oncologist put the squash on this, they began chemotherapy. As soon as they got me hooked up to the chemo and the pump started moving it into my body, I had a systematic reaction. My throat closed up, my face swelled and went numb and turned purple, and I couldn't breath. They immediately stopped the treatment. Under this terrible stress I no longer wanted to take the treatment. The nurses convinced me otherwise and that I had to take the treatment to fight my cancer so I can still be here for my wife and daughter. So the next morning we tried again with a higher dilution rate and I didn't have a reaction. This was a very emotional moment for me because this chemo was going to keep me alive and kill my cancer. Unfortunately it didn't fully do its job though. I am still fighting cancer because it became resistant to prior treatment methods.

We had planned a week long vacation to the beach, travelling from Ohio in order to spend time with my family, including my parents and brother, and my wife's parents, and our 2 children.  After having fun for 4 days, my father in law awoke Thursday morning complaining of some pain in his jaw and heartburn.  My father in law and his wife felt that they should conservatively go to the hospital to get checked out.  Unfortunately, a blood test returned with slightly elevated enzyme numbers, meaning some minor heart damage may have occurred.  No problem we though, just a few more tests and a ruined day of vacation.  Well, after heart catheter, the really bad news came in.  My father in law would need quadruple bypass surgery immediately.  They scheduled him for surgery Monday morning, and he would have to stay in Myrtle Beach for another few weeks after the surgery until he was allowed to fly home.  What I will remember the most is visiting my father in law on Friday morning at the hospital and letting him visit with his grandchildren.  He was so stone faced and obviously scared and in mental anguish.  I gave him a hug goodbye, since I had to drive my kids home on Saturday, and he was in tears.  It was very painful to witness that.  Fortunately, my wife was going to stay with her mom and dad for a few more days to get through the surgery and help any way she could.  In excellent news, my father in law had a perfect surgery and is now recovering getting stronger every day.  The whole sequence of events is a good reminder to take life one day at a time, and appreciate all that we are given.  Hopefully we have many more years of his presence to make many more memories.",,36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD8CYEBD,0.0

Helping my brother and sister in law out with the kids was both a blessing and a punishment. It had been a long time since I babysat and now I remember why. I am exhausted. The kids were sooo bad and so spoiled. They sure were not used to my kind of shopping and cooking. I took the little guy shopping and he started to cry when I picked up apples. He demanded grapples. What the heck is a grapple? And parmigano regiano cheese? Not in my house kiddo.  Part of me feels like a bad aunt, but part o me knows that I taught them things they needed to know.  They were horrified when I walked outside barefoot, this really amused me.  I love them more than anything, we had some really great times.

It was a completely impulse and random decision, but it turned out to be one of the best decisions that I have ever made. I was already having creeping suspicions about the job and a voice in the back of my head was telling me to just quit and never look back. At first, I didn't want to listen to it, but as time passed the voice started to grow louder and louder. I started to notice things that I seemed to have been to naive to notice at first. Mainly though, my mental health was in a very terrible place and working at this job did nothing but seem to make it worse for me. On top of that, I was not being compensated properly and I discovered I was having money constantly stolen from me. So one day I went in to collect my paycheck and I was getting excuses as to why it wasn't there. As I was walking out, I just kind of decided ""fuck it"" and I never returned. At first, I slightly regretted the decision. Not because I believed it was the wrong decision or anything, but because it was such an impulse decision and I didn't really have a back up plan at the time. Looking back, I am extremely happy I made that decision. Financially speaking, it was very dumb. But I can honestly say that I started to feel loads better mentally after I quit. That's what really matters right?",374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKS3ZXYQU,,0.0

I started to believe in his vision when I heard him on podcasts. I had never gone to a political event in my life but was really encouraged to attend this one. A big reason that motivated me was the fact that he was spreading a message that was so profound but no one else knew about. He had no political background so his name recognition was next to nothing. I didn't want to tell too much people about it because I didn't think that they would care enough to come with me. I only told one friend who I knew would be interested. The scene at the rally was amazing. It included so many people from different backgrounds. I'm not religious at all but it felt like we were listening to the words of our savior. Everything he said made so much sense. As the event ended, the crowd cheered ""ANDREW YANG"".

There is one particular kindergartener, a blonde-haired little boy with none of his front teeth and a long braid down his back, that I have come to enjoy seeing around school. About two weeks ago, he came up to me and was crying. He grabbed me in an embrace and told me how much he wanted ""Picture Day"" to last all day. His mother had dressed him up and styled his braid with extra care that morning. He clearly was very excited about how nice he looked but was having a hard morning. He looked very precious and it put a smile on my face. He shared with me that he was feeling sad and really needed a friend that morning. We got him his breakfast and made our way into my office. After opening up his chocolate milk and juice cartons, he started to cry and leaned his head against the wall. He doubted that he could make it through the whole day without getting his picture taken at least twice. I felt sad to see him so upset. He jumped up from his chair and hugged me around my waist, still crying. I talked to him about how hard school can be and how brave he was. He told me that he felt better.

You never expect this sort of thing to happen to you, but it did. I want to start this by saying I HAVE NEVER BEEN IN A WRECK BEFORE. So I've just spent the last couple of days mentally processing. I think now I'm finally ready to talk about it.  Being on the interstate at night and going the speed limit, I was hit. Not totaled, so that's nice, but it did involve another man and it all happened really suddenly. The impact was enough to get a few dings and scratches, I was coherent for most of it though. The cars weren't great though. Somehow in the midst of stuff I wondered how much it would cost to fix. Did they pay my deductible? I still don't officially know the answer to that question. By the time I was able to get out of my car I saw the guy that had hit me.  He was FREAKING OUT. I was still in shock, I think, but I should probably have been more phased by seeing it than I was. I mean, he had a motorcycle on EACH SIDE OF HIM. There was blood, enough that continuing to take the scene in made me nauseous. I remember the screaming, watching him as I was spoken to by help, I can still see the way his arms looked against them.  I remember when the paramedics came just passing out. Like I was in such shock that I kind of stopped keeping my thoughts together and BOOM out like a light. It was only after the ride to the Hospital and I came to/as they went over the normal stuff that I had thought to wonder where he was. I still picture that scene in my minds eye and get freaked out. I asked how everyone was and they told me they were fine, no serious injuries. I'm nervous about even getting in a car again. I mean, even being as safe as possible something like that can happen y'know?",,378XPAWRUDZMQGA3Z5LOW1BZJ8QIA8,0.0

It would be the last time I saw him before he passed away.   He came to see my family with my step mother as part of an annual trip.  It happened to coincide this time with an annual fair our county holds.  We took the family to the fair and my dad got to see my children ride roller coasters and play games.  I took plenty of photos of him laughing and trying to get in a couple of the rides with them.  I recall giggling at the time when he couldn't quite fit into the seat of a tiny roller coaster car.  After the rides, we went over the petting zoo section.  He talked to my kids all about how to care for the chickens and goats that they encountered.  He purchased a cup of food for them to feed the animals with.  After we were done at the fair, we stopped at a restaurant that serves fun sandwiches.  I felt amused while my husband tried to pay the check.  My dad had already made sure to tell the server to give the whole check to him when we weren't looking.  That evening, after we put the kids to bed, we watched a movie in my living room.  The next day, they took their trip back to Florida, promising to see each other soon.  Unfortunately, that's a promise I can't keep.  I miss my dad.",,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3Q6D2,0.0

He's a terrific man, but has a way about him that is a little intimidating. He's always been in control of everything around him. As I was growing up, I saw him as Superman. The years have taken their toll and he is now in his late 80s and having problems with his health and his memory. It's hard to see Superman become human. During my visit, I stayed with him at the retirement home and we had wonderful conversations about life, family, what we think happens to us after this life, etc. I felt so honored that he was confiding in me some of his most personal thoughts and fears. I felt closer to him than I ever had before. We talked about how much he missed my mother who passed away a few years ago. We talked about how he hopes to be remembered. We just talked about life in general. Towards the end of the visit, he told me that he had his lawyer draw up papers making me his power of attorney and his healthcare power of attorney. He said I was the only one he trusted to always keep his best interest at heart. I'm the youngest of two children, so I assumed my older brother would be the one he would pick for this. I had gone to visit my elderly father, but when I left for home, I was leaving what felt like my best friend and confidant.",,378XPAWRUDZMQGA3Z5LOW1BZT4VAI7,0.0

I was really enjoying myself and thought my friend was too. He had been drinking some, but nothing excessive or out of the ordinary for him.  Our waiter was Hispanic and was super attentive and friendly.  We had been at the restaurant for around an hour, and I told my friend I needed to get going because I had an early day at work the next day. My friend said the bill was on him and he looked around for our waiter. We got the guys attention and he came over to us.  My friend though he should have been over to us sooner, I guess, because he said something about the guy having swum the river to get to the us faster than he got us our bill.  I think my jaw must have hit the table. I was completely shocked and couldn't believe such nasty words had come out of my friends mouth.  The waiter just left the bill and walked off. I was so embarrassed. My husband is Mexican and I had no idea my friend had just racist thoughts.  I paid the bill instead and left the waiter a huge tip.  I know that cant make up for such racism but I felt I had to do something.  I walked out with my friend and I could feel my face still flaming from anger and embarrassment mental at his words. I told him before I left the parking lot that what he had said was uncalled for and racist. He looked at me like I was in the wrong. We havent spoken since.",,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0T3OD67,0.0

I was so shocked and did absolutely nothing wrong to deserve losing my job. At the time I worked as a customer service representative in a call center for a utility company. I was responsible for taking phone calls and helping customers out by turning on their power, turning off their power, reviewing their bills and answering other questions that they might have about their bill. I also transferred them to other departments if I was not able to help them. I was also considered a supervisor and helped others that needed it on the fly. One day I was working and noticed that people were being called into the office and they did not return. There was a person from human resources boxing up their items from their desks. After lunch I was called into the human resources office. They explained to me that I was being let go but could not tell me why. I refused to sign the paperwork for being fired. They then escorted me outside of the building and handed me a box of my belongings. I talked with others that was fired that same day and day they let everyone go to budget cuts. It was only an assumption but it should not of happened the way that it did- with no explanation!  I went home and ate my emotions away.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5UNNBIV,0.0

My daughter had been married for some years. She and her husband have been trying to get a child but things were not working as expected. She was able to conceive last year and she was able to give birth to her child in May. Since she stayed in the same state as I do, I decided to be with her on the day she went into labor. That day was very hectic and scary for everybody involved. I think immediately she went into labor, her husband called me and then drove her to the hospital. I joined her at the hospital. When we got the hospital things became a little bit complicated. Her husband tried his best to be with her and to keep her strong. She eventually delivered perfectly. After deliver, she had to stay at the hospital for a while. Back at her home, I had been planning a surprise return for her. It was expected that the surprise return party would make her feel happy. Finally, she was discharged from the hospital. When she got home, and saw the surprise return party she just burst into tears. According to her a tsunami of emotions engulfed her at that moment. Her husband couldn't help but started crying as well. It was beautiful to watch and really emotional.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5ZZMIBU,0.0

I was behind on bills as it was and I was counting on overtime for the next couple of months to catch up on what I had missed. In actuality I had spent more than I could afford on that vacation to Aruba but it was just something I had to do for my family. When your friends tell you that they are taking their whole families on a trip to Aruba and they want you to come, you don't pass that up. Those are memories that could last a lifetime. Anyway, I was trying to catch up on those bills and going through a ton of stress at work that carried over to home, I just couldn't help it. It was only a matter of time before it started to truly affect my work performance, I just didn't think it would happen so quickly. Juggling all my account while keeping the bosses happy was something that I was always able to do with minimal effort, I just think the amount of stress made me handle situations in ways I would never do and act in ways I should never act. It started when one of my biggest accounts called asking for follow up information on details regarding their last purchase. I just snapped, I told them they'd get it when they always got it and if it wasn't good enough then they should take their business elsewhere. Well they took that business elsewhere, right to my bosses and over my head. When my immediate supervisor confronted me about, I admittedly got defensive and told him to shove it, in so many words. Not my best decision. So that was 2 weeks ago. Since then everything had been going just fine, I applied myself harder than ever to make up for my bad decisions and told myself if I outworked everyone, everything would be okay. Well, when my second biggest account called asking to compare prices and look for ways to cut costs and my answer didn't suffice, that was the last straw. Since I had fixed all my mistakes and took care of everything I needed to, I felt like I hadn't done anything wrong. So when my boss came into my office with news that I had been let go it caught me off guard. I was not given a formal warning of any kind. I was shocked to be learning I wouldn't be getting severance pay and they would not even give me 2 weeks notice. I had a great run here at the company and I accomplished more than I ever thought I would. It's just so upsetting to see it end in this way. I'm ready for my next challenge. I'm ready for what's to come and whatever life throws at me. I know it'll be a tough next couple of months and it's going to get even tougher until the next opportunity comes along, but I'm ready to fight with all I've got.",,37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5UNNBIV,0.0

I had been working with the organization for a number of weeks thanks to my childhood friends also joining the team with me. Together, we work in the marketing department for the organization and that means that we will be traveling the country soon. We've been tasked with finding new business for the company and will need to go to a number of states to do just that. My bosses were impressed with the work that I've done so far and gave me a promotion to reflect that. It makes me feel good to know that they think that I am a beneficial part of the organization because I put a lot of work into what I do here. I've found that having my friends working with me makes the work easier. We've already been given a number of tasks that would typically be given to more senior employees. It seems that the higher ups in the organization think that not only are we a good team but that we are effective and trustworthy with important jobs. I feel that I made a good decision coming to work here with my friends. My last job wasn't as fun and that could either be because of the job or the lack of having my friends working with me. I hope that our first trip is to the Northeast. I've always wanted to visit that part of the country, but haven't been able to get around to it. This would be a good chance to do just that. It will also be great to do that on the company's dime. We'll find out soon where we're being sent first. I'm very happy with this new promotion.",,37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZU7AAJ9,0.0

I am finding more to do. It's amazing that not going to a group will expand your horizons. Atleast it has for me. I have recently been doing alot of sewing on my own and loving it. Changing the way clothes look. Altering clothes and trying different things with fabric. The different ways to use fabric has been a real challange to me and one I relish.

During these years we have discovered that it will be nearly impossible for us to conceive a child naturally.  This was very devastating new for us.  My family and his have been hounding us for grandchildren.  We play it off coolly, because we don't feel it necessary to involve them in our fertility issues.  It's our business.  After several years of failed fertility treatments, it because more and more painful to see my family members and friends experiencing births.  A week ago, my sister-in-law gave birth to her fourth child.  It was extremely upsetting for me as my sister-in-law indiscriminately has children with no means to actually care for them.  My husband is a great support system for me during this time.  I can't help but be resentful and envious of the people out there having children that they don't even care about, and those who choose to abort.  Being a mother was at the top of my list of what I wanted out of life.  Now a have a brand new niece to rub my nose in the fact that it was probably never happen for me.

With flowers for mom and gift for baby in hand, I made my way through the hospital hallways, recalling the memories of the birth of my own baby, my now two year old and husband walking alongside me. In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research.  My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. Somehow my many ""needs"" have put my one major ""want"" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. ""What?"" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content.",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E5YBJ6,0.0

The accounting department started to investigate, it was not at all clear. There were missing money from that project and som others as well. Eventhought, I had nothing to do with it, it was not the first time, so they said they need to let me go. I had no more option than quitting my job. I was sad and depressed for about 4 weeks.

She passed away in her sleep from a heart attack. It was a shocking and unexpected event for our family. She did not have a will in place so this has made it very difficult on our family to handle all of her business. The morning that it happened my father woke me up and told me that she was gone. At first I didn't understand what he meant by gone. I thought maybe she went shopping or something. When I got out of bed the ambulance was just leaving with her. My family all piled into the car to go down to the hospital where they were taking her. They basically pronounced her dead on arrival at the hospital as the EMT's in the ambulance were unable to revive her. My father was very emotionally upset by this event. We also struggled to handle her funeral arrangements as we did not have access to any of her bank accounts. Funerals are so ridiculously expensive. The social security administration offers a few dollars in death benefits but those can only go to a spouse not to a child to assist in burial. Even the cheapest option being cremation was well over 1,000$. It's difficult because the hospital only gives you 24hours to handle this and have the funeral home pick up the body from the hospital.",37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E68JBQ,,0.0

In June 2019 I decided for the first time to go hiking. I had been going to the gym in my apartment for quite a number of months walking up to three miles each morning. I decided to hike one of the high peaks in the Adirondacks mountains in New York. It is called Cascade mountain. It is approximately 5000 feet high. I got up at 6 a.m. in the morning I drove from my home in Albany New York to the entrance to the trail. The trip is about 4 hours. I began the height and followed the various trail markers to The summit. Along the way I met quite a lot of people. most were younger than me but there were a few by age. Everyone was extremely friendly. It was a beautiful sunny day. I took the hike slow since it's a steady incline to The summit. I reach the summit after approximately two hours. It was beautiful. There was no commercial property anywhere to be seen. They were other mountains trees and forests all around. I spent about an hour at the summit eating lunch. I then hike back down. I then return to my home. All in all it was an amazing experience,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7AJBV,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5F7AJBV,0.0

I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: ""Get that gum ball, Archie."" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years. Thank you, Archie. You deserve all the gumballs. Me and CatDad love you a lot.",37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,0.0

How could someone just, you know, hurt you in that way after saying first how much they love you? He was my first boyfriend, I never had sex with anyone else, but apparently I'm a slut? Really? I just dont know what to think anymore. My trust in other people is gone, I guess? I just really wish I had chosen better. I wish I could go back and just not go out with him, that I had rejected him the day he asked me out. I remember him telling me how much he loved me, and now this? Really? How can someone you care about so much become such a stranger? I'll admit it, sometime I miss him. Sometimes I want to see him, but he's such a shitty person.

Again. Well, I didn't break up with him, he broke up with me, but I technically broke up with him the first time. It's complicated. Anyway, he had been really mean to me for a while, ever since we started dating--but, well, I'm really soft. When I see someone show emotion, like cry or something, I immediately change my perspective on them. I become a 'protector', or 'fixer', I guess? I wanted to help him get better. He sold me a lot of sob stories about his parents, and I ate it up. So, he became my best friend. I let it happen, because I cared about him a lot at that point, I guess? Psychologically, it ruined me. I became depressed and dependent. I used to not care what anyone thought about me, but I became obsessed. The event from 3 months ago was mind crushing, though. He told me how he just used me, how I was just ""addicted' to him, called me a bunch of sexist names and how everyone was using me and how I was dependent on others for validation. Now, i've never been one to care about what others think about me. I'm extremely independent, I work for my own money (we're college students), and I don't really have parents who are present, technically? But, yeah, he called me dependent and a 'drain' on his wallet, despite the fact I had spent a ton of money on him, too, despite having less. I would pay for his haircuts, his food, whenever he didn't have the money I'd spot him immediately. He never had a job, it was his parent's money and I was working 3 jobs at the peak of our relationship. I guess i'm still a little angry about it?",37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJNTZ0R1Z,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJNTZ0R1Z,0.0

It was late so my options were limited. I remembered there was a hotel bar that was open late, so I decided to check it out. I sat at the bar and ordered a draft beer and a shot of tequila. An attractive woman, who was sitting a few seats over, started a conversation with me. Turns out she had very similar interests as me and we had many things in common. We flirted quiet a bit, until it was time to leave because the bar was closing. She invited me up to her room to have a few more cocktails, which I gladly accepted. We had an amazing night, staying up until morning to watch the sunrise. That morning she asked me to stay over again, and I did. I ended up staying the entire week. After the week had passed, she had to leave and go back home. She had asked me if I would like to move away with her, and I seriously considered it.

I remember choosing her favorite flavor of icing (strawberry) along with some snacks for myself, paying the cashier, and leaving the store. It was chilly outside, so I was zipping up my sweatshirt and getting my keys out of my purse to unlock my car when I felt something brush my ankle. I was so startled that I let out a small scream and jerked my leg away sharply. I looked down, terrified that a rat had just touched me, but instead I saw a fluffy, furry tail disappearing under my car.  I was afraid that my impulsive reaction may have caused the animal to run away. I knelt down and saw a small kitten, wet and shivering as it leaned against my rear wheel. The kitten appeared to have been someone's pet because it had a small collar around its neck. However, it also looked like it was injured because one of its paws stuck out at an odd angle.  I wondered how I would get this kitten out from under my car without scaring it away.  I remembered that I just bought some snacks and groceries for myself that may entice the kitten and make it trust me. I placed my grocery bags on the ground and dug through my groceries to find the canned tuna I had just bought. I pulled the tab on the tuna can to open it and placed it on the ground.  It took a few minutes for the kitten to feel confident enough to step out from under my car, but it soon began to sniff and nibble away at the tuna.

That stay at the hotel changed my life. I met my now girlfriend there and we spent the week together in California. We had such a wonderful at Coronado beach and San Diego. We went to the zoo, saw seals laying near the ocean, went bike riding along the beach and shared countless meals that week. I truly believe that I met my soulmate three months ago at that bar in the hotel. We shared our thoughts, memories, stories, struggles, hobbies, families, childhood stories and just about everything else. I don't think I stopped smiling since I met her. When she asked me if I wanted to move in with her, which required me to move across the country to California, I was hesitant at first but I couldn't say no. I knew that I would lose her if we tried to do a long distance relationship. She said she would support me while I find a job out in California and while that was nice, I was still very worried. What kind of person just quits their job and moves across the country? Well, I decided that since I am young to go for it. If the relationship did not work out, I always wanted to live in a warmer climate anyway. Lucky for me I ended finding a great job in my field right away and drove across the country to live with her. Our time together so far has been a dream. I look forward to every minute we spend together. Sometimes I wonder to myself what would have happened if I decided to not trust my gut.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EB6MYW2,0.0

It is storming outside. I pull up into my driveway like I have a thousand times. I get out of the car and walk to the back to open the hatch of my Toyota 4 Runner. I am thinking about the thunder overhead. I reach into the back to grab some of the paper bags filled with items I needed. Much to my surprise, there is a tiny black blur near my feet. I wonder to myself if I am tired or imagining things. Then, it occurs to me this is not a dream or my imagination but rather a tiny black kitten staring up at me. I set my bags of groceries down which scares the little kitten. It runs across the yard into the bushes in my neighbor's yard. I am completely in shock because I am impressed the kitten was brave enough to walk up to me who is a complete stranger. It is cold and storming outside so I start to think wildly of ideas that might allow me to entice this kitten to come inside. I rush into my house to find a can of wet cat food. I already owned two black cats so I thought maybe somehow they could all get along. My two cats watched me as I stole a can of their food in a panic. My significant other was asking me what I was doing but all I blurt out is the word ""kitten"" and rush out the door again. She's just as intrigued as I am with the idea of taking in this stray so she creeps outside next to me, I lay down on my driveway and open the can. I continue to call for the little kitten. The moment I opened the can of food it came bounding over from the bushes. I took it to the vet immediately after bringing the kitten inside.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EB6NWY1,0.0

So I kept a close eye on the weather forecast for the day we were to go. Unfortunately it looked like rain and there ended up being a major storm in the morning. Lots of rain and really no sign of it breaking up, until around mid-day where all of a sudden it went away. So we met up and it was actually very nice weather by the time we arrived at the park. There were a lot of people there even with the threat of rain. We had dinner at the park before the game and sat down to watch the game. The people who sat around us were all nice and we had conversations about the game. The game went long and it was an exciting one with lots of action. Unfortunately our team ended up losing in a heartbreaking fashion in the last inning. After the game it took a while to leave the stadium and even longer to get out of the parking ramp I was in. All in all it was great time and everything worked out.",37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6,37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6,0.0

I really think I put my foot down with this issue. The boyfriend and our relationship. I told her that I absolutely would not help her bail him out. I let her know, in no uncertain terms, that I won't risk my money on a guy I don't really like, and I couldn't count on him to show up to his court date. Hell, she can't count on him to show up to a regular date with her, so how can he be trusted? She was really pissed off with me, and told me what a terrible friend I was. That's when I lost it. I told her that she may think what she wants of me, but her opinion no longer matters to me. I let her know I am sick of her endless complaining about her job, her family, her boyfriend, and basically life in general. I suggested she get counseling for her issues so she has an non involved party who can help her sort our her problems. I have been there for her since we were in high school, but honestly, I think she's doing drugs or something. She's been a nut job, with a terrible temper for the past couple of years, and I can't deal with it anymore. I really did mean she should seek help, it wasn't just me saying something ugly, although she seemed to take it that way. A big first step would be if that jerk of a boyfriend staying in jail, and quit bringing her down to his level. She needs to get some of her old confidence back. I told her that I do care about her, but I simply can't hang out with her until she gets some real help. That was when she hung up on me, and I haven't heard from her since.

We all flew out of Indianapolis together and that was when the fun started.  We all sat together on the plane and chatted about old times.  It was great to catch up with everyone and I felt a little guilty that I haven't kept in better contact with them over the years.  We all used to be so close and now life has taken us in different directions.  When we arrived in Canada we immediately checked into our hotel and went out to dinner.  It was a fantastic meal and we continued our conversations from the plane and continued to catch up with each others lives.  We also visited museums and even watched a professional basketball game.  We were having the best time and I was so glad to be there until Joe pulled me aside after several drinks after dinner the second night there.  He confessed that back in college he had slept with my then girlfriend, which is now my wife.  He said the guilt has been eating away at him and he felt I deserved to know.  I'm crushed.  My wife and I have a great relationship and I'm totally blindsided by the confessions.  I don't even know what to do with the information-it clearly happened a long time ago, it was a one time thing, I'm happily married now.  I'm not sure what to do.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2EZTOWY0,0.0

My friend Daniel and I met when I was 18, and we had a lot in common. Over the span of 7 years a lot of intimate and fun memories were made together. We both attended college, worked, and spent many hours over the weekends hanging out. As we both grew older over the span of our friendship, we started to drift apart. Daniel was accepted for a job across the states, and I was in the midst of nursing school. We both were finding it difficult to maintain a friendship, and see each other between our busy schedules. Both of us were succumbed into our work and school, and had minimal time outside to make plans to see one another. Daniel was hoping that eventually he would be returning here to the south after he completed his job training, but his approval for transfer was never accepted. Three months ago my life changed. I grew tired of the distance, as did Daniel. The lack of communication, and vastly different work schedules began tearing our friendship apart. Three months ago, Daniel and I made time finally to sit down in person over lunch and discuss our friendship.  The discussion did not go well, and we both felt exhausted trying to maintain a long distance friendship any further. I wanted so badly to come up with a reason to continue the friendship, but I was tired of putting energy into a practically non-existent friendship anymore. Daniel and I agreed over our lunch that day to walk separate ways. The lunch ended with me in tears, knowing my best friend wouldn't be my best friend anymore. Truth is, I still love him and wish him well, but I know it is time to move forward in my life.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E5NQRCE,0.0

I noticed the air conditioner wasn't blowing cool air. So I took it to a chain mechanic company near my location. After the car was checked, I was quoted a price of a major part that needed fixing with work needed. I decided to go ahead with getting it done, since AC is something we need in the car, especially in summer time. The work was done in a few hours, and we went to pick up the car. As we left the shop, my car stalled and wouldn't drive. I had driven out on a main roadway with lots of traffic. Thankfully, we didn't have an accident, and the car behind me was able to stop when I stalled. I drove very slowly around the block back to the shop and informed them of the problem. They checked and apparently had not tightened or adjusted a part well, which caused the issue. I was very disappointed and let them know that their error could have caused an accident or worse. However, I was glad they were able to adjust it quickly and then we were on our way. I often think about what happened and how it may have turned out badly. Thankfully, nothing major happened. It was quite a scare.",37WLF8U1WQCC99OO9VPOTCOQGV06KX,,0.0

We really like florida so it was a no brainer on where we were going. I booked the airfare and the hotel. We were so excited to go. The trip was to celebrate different birthdays. we had two connecting flights that we had to catch. The first leg was awesome. As we got on to board the second leg we removed from the plane because the flight attendant said my husband had an extra carry on. He was carrying the bag for an elderly member of our family and he tried to explain that but they didn't care. We had to get off the plane and take a later flight.  It put a horrible taste in out mouth for the beginning of our trip. We put so much money into this trip that it really made me so angry with the airlines. We missed scheduled activities because of the delay. The part that stuck with me was how we were treated by the airline.

I was working downtown on a Tuesday morning, like I often do and fell. It was miserable, I was so busy with a work deadline and looking down at my phone that I didn't even think about looking down to the sidewalk, I should have obviously because I tripped on an uneven section. I knew as soon as I hit the ground that this was really bad and the pain was immense. I had been carrying a coffee in one hand and cell phone in the other, I was covered in coffee and my cell phone screen was smashed. Thankfully it happened right near the coffee shop downtown so there we so many witnesses that someone was able to call an ambulance straight away! I guess that was one positive to the situation. It only took about 10 minutes for the ambulance to arrive but it felt like a life time. Thankfully the hospital is nearby and they transported me quickly. The wait once I got there to be seen was amazingly quick, I guess Tuesday mornings are quiet for hospitals. After the x-ray they announced I had broken and dislocated my ankle in two places, I guess that explained my extreme pain and the swelling! The doctor was so courteous and told me to not panic at the sight of my ankle, it looked horrendous. Dark gray and like nothing I have ever seen before. The funniest thing for me was that a friend texted me and said they had driven by at exact moment I fell, what are the chances of that ever happening?! The whole incident was embarrassing, I should have taken more care, I mean the amount of times that I have told my kids to get their faces out of their phones. The irony is I was trying to catch up my work and instead, I am incredibly behind now. I keep telling myself that it could have been worse and my ankle will heal.

Eventually the full time care fell to me about 6 years ago and I have been caring for her ever since. Suddenly out of the blue he reached out and we talked on the phone and he asked me to go flying with him. I have not been flying with him since I was a little boy 40 years ago. When I met up with him it was a bit strange but we had a non alcoholic drink in the bar first and just talked a bit and we found some common ground. We then went up and had a good time sightseeing things in the air. I think what has happened is that with age, we tend to mellow out and gain more experience. I have also realized with this experience that time is short and none of us will be here for very long and there is no time for extended family fights where people ignore people for decades at a time. I think that afterwards we were both happy that we got together again. After the flight we went back to the bar and ordered 2 beers each. It was at this time that we began to loosen up and went into what the fight was about. We talked about his sister, or my mother, for about a half and hour. After reaching common ground about her, we began to talk about our lives at length. I was particularly interested at how he had been for the last 15 years. He focused on his family and what they had been up to, and I shared the same bout myself and my family. I am very happy that we are now talking again.",37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EXWRRCP,,0.0

I am heading home from work when I was hit from behind in my car by somebody not paying attention. This was always a possibility, with driving for work each day, but I always thought my defensive driving strategies and confidence in my abilities would be able to avoid it. But, sometimes, other factors play a role in my life experiences. The damage to my car was heart-breaking to see, because I knew what was to come.      The accident caused my car to be totaled, along with my confidence on the road. The driver was not helpful, he did not care and lied to my face and to the police officer. This made me angry, and lowered my trust even further in people, which is already very low. The funds, I had been saving would now need to be used for a car, which was not part of any plan. All the time and effort spent on saving, seems to have been for nothing, and once again I feel like a failure due to this financial situation.     Then, my luck seemed to change, the car was quoted by an insurance agent and I received a lot more money then I thought for the car. I was happy again, but that withered away as I began searching for a replacement car. I was forced to take on more bills and even more worry. On the plus side, I finally have a decent car that is nice and dependable, but my confidence and anxiety are in a rough place.     I am now even more worried about driving, and damages to my new car that I have to pay a lot money for many years. The confidence I had in my driving has still not come back, and this makes me feel like I lack ability and weak-minded. I hope this passes, because I do not like feeling worse about my life. I will have to work on getting my confidence back, and reducing the amount of daily worry I have. This was not a great day or experience, and has definitely impacted my life each day since August 5th, but I think it will pass soon and I can have finally my mind and confidence back.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EG4XRCU,0.0

It's really hard to imagine how I will get over this, which is depressing. But I know I have to find a way to get past it. This is really affecting my relationships; reflecting back on the last few months I can see that it's really eroded my trust in people. I know it's not healthy, but it's so difficult to get over it! And seeing how Susie has pulled away has been a real shock; I realize it's been hard, but she is - was - my best friend. I tried calling her at Christmas time and when she hung up on me it was like a cold splash of water to my face. I was hoping that it'd be different once the new year started. New year, new beginnings, that kind of thing. I made this a specific resolution, as I've always been good with those as an incentive. But it really hasn't changed, and that makes me so upset. I have to stop worrying so much; I think that's really exacerbating my problems with trusting people, but it's also really tiring and exhausting. If I wasn't constantly thinking about the accident, maybe I'd be able to stop worrying so much. At least, I think I would. The other big impact is how much my confidence has been destroyed. I don't know that I was really over confident before the accident, but I did have some respect for myself, and that's gone now, too. It's sad. It's really amazing how much that accident has taken over my whole life; it's had such a negative impact on my quality of life overall, and my state of mind has taken a huge turn for the worse. I have to stop wallowing in self-pity and get past this; it's up to me to make my life better.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EG4XRCU,0.0

My daughter had brought a bouquet of flowers and there was a note attached to them that told me to open the small gift first. I opened the gift and there were a pair of pink baby booties. I started smiling and asked her ""is this what I think it means?"" and she replied yes. Well, there were lots of hugs and laughter after that. I asked her a million of questions. She told us she was four months pregnant and the baby was a little girl. We talked about names and she told me she couldn't decide on which one - she had two selected. As of today, she has not told us the name. I was so excited that day for her and her husband, I could barely eat my lunch. It truly was the most memorable day during the past 6 months for me. I could not think of any other days more exciting than that one.

He arrived early and we started at a brewery near my house. The atmosphere was great. I was surprised how crowded the place was. We started with some flights because he wanted to try everything. After that, we went to another brewery not too far from there. We had some more to drink and a lot of laughs. Everytime we get together laughs are guaranteed.

She moved from New York State to New Mexico.  She is moving because there is more work out there apparently.  We had to spend a lot of time helping her get her stuff ready and get it in boxes.  She drove the whole way there.  My parents and I also had to take care of her cats for a little while, while she was moving all of the stuff out of her apartment.  I think a thing that really surprised me about the whole move was how upset it made my mom.  She seemed really broken up that my sister was going to be so far away.  I think my sister was glad to get away from my parents because they are kind of overbearing.  I was very tired after helping her pack up and move.  I wasn't very sad about her moving away because she is going to a place with more opportunity.  I was kind of upset by how upset my mom was though.  Her cats were very nice when they were staying with us but very shy.  I got her a going away gift basket with some bath and body stuff and toiletries so she wouldn't have to worry about that when she moved in, and also some snacks for the road.  I think she was very excited about moving away and I am somewhat jealous.",37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87E7KATSY,37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87E7KATSY,0.0

She wasn't sick at all. I had just talked to her weeks prior, and expressed excitement over seeing her start walking her dog again when it gets warmer. I think about her dog sometimes when I'm outside, and wonder if she's doing okay without her beloved owner. I spoke to my neighbor's children recently, and they told me they are planning to sell the house soon. I'm very nervous about that. I lived next to my neighbor who passed away my entire life... no one else has ever lived in that house. I hope whoever moves in will take care of the house and that my family and their family will get a long all right. I miss my neighbor. I know she's gone now but it still feels like she's there, somehow. I got angry the other day because her family hired someone to mow her old lawn, and the worker did a hack-job on it, probably because he knew she was dead (he used to mow the lawn for her when she was alive, too). That just really upset me. I found it completely disrespectful. She deserved better than that, not to mention her family that paid him. All in all, I think about my neighbor a lot, pretty much whenever I gaze over towards her house. I miss her.",37Z929RLGAUGZQC8AH6JV87E8YDTSU,,0.0

About 6 months ago I was in an dating app just trying to kill time. I was going trough a hard time in my life and I was very depressed. Suddenly, a person started talking to me, telling me that I look sad in my profile picture. After speaking for a while we decided to meet. I thought nothing of this meeting, I simply made of it as another one night stand, but when I saw the person. He was more good looking than the pictures, he had a killing smiling and a very cheery and bright personality. I was very nervous and I feared that he might not like me, or that I wasn't good enough for him. After meeting several times, our relationship has grown stronger and stronger. The most memorable thing is that even one time when I told him my real age, since I look way younger than I am. He seemed a little thrown back by this and I told him maybe it was time for us to end this relationship. After a week he texted me saying he still wanted to talk to me and now we are communicating everyday and we have a strong relationship. This experience has showed to me that there is people who deeply care about me, and that I am a desirable person. Not just for one night stands, but for relationships too. My confidence has greatly expanded thanks to this encounter. I hope our relationship lasts a long time.",,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47KX1J732,0.0

My friends and I all are big dancers and during the contest we danced to ice ice baby and won. There were a lot of people participating and it was great to see everyone contributing to a good cause. Even the adults were dancing and gave us a run for our money. The contest was judged by some members of the community and they had a great time doing it. No prizes were awarded but bragging rights came with our victory. I felt really great after to see that we had raised over $1000 to support the people in Haiti. We sent the money off the next day and are excited to hear back from the group receiving it. I know they will really appreciate it greatly. Their country is very in need of any support. I'm excited to continue on supporting other individuals in the future.,,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N,0.0

He got very sick with pneumonia, and went to the hospital. When he was in the hospital they found two spots on his lung. When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath.  I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years.  Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59AR8S0G,384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59AR8S0G,0.0

I was told about this event about 3 months ago and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community. I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success. At the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. In the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given, and what you can do to make it even better for others.

This moment was memorable because I was finally closing a chapter in my life that had took so much of my time. I remember getting ready that day. I woke up early because I wanted to do my hair and makeup. I wanted to have the time to make it perfect. But, I quickly realized not everything was going to turn out perfect when my hair would just not curl. The time was already to go and I didn't have my dress on or my makeup up done. As the clock zoomed by, I was in a crying fit as my mom rushed me into my dress and I walked to the car with no shoes on and no makeup. Already a day I had dreamed about, planned out so perfectly was already ruined. I knew it I could feel it deep in my gut. The icing on the cake was when I arrived to the arena in my four inch heels and realized the floor was completely concrete, and I would have to stand for hours one in. This day could not have turned out worse. I just wanted to go home and get my diploma in the mail. I realized this event was not for me. I wasn't doing if for me. I was just happy to graduate and wanted to take a nap after a long 18 credit semester. I was doing all this for my family.

I did ask a few people I saw, but they were civilians and only worked there and didn't know anything about the a graduation.  The place was so big.  We spotted a car with dressed up people drive by and I said to follow them.  I figured they were going to the same place.  I was right and we finally got to the right area.  Then we tried to find parking.  This was a tough task.  We should of left earlier.  The parking area was full and we were running out of time before the event started.   Next to the parking lot was a grassy hill and we ended up parking on it.  We had to run down the sidewalk to get to the building.  The only seating was spread out so we couldn't sit together.

I was woken up in the middle of the night by a message from a friend back home. I knew right away it would be terrible news. He told me that a close friend of mine going back to childhood had died from an overdose. I was immediately struck by a sick feeling and incredible sadness. I was in a beautiful city, maybe the most beautiful in the world, and everything felt like reminders of mortality and friendship lost. I spent the rest of the day with watery eyes wandering around. I tried to clear my mind but despite all the interesting and beautiful things I could not forget the sadness. It was a beautiful summer day and everything was bathed in a golden light. The beauty made the deep sadness even more poignant. As the day got late, I climbed up one of the hills in the city to the monastery of San Miniato al Monte. It is a monastery that has existed for 1000 years. I sat inside the church, designed and painted by some of the most skilled artisans that have ever lived, and thought about everything that had happened. I thought about my life, my lost friend, my living friends and family, and so much more. I was again in tears.

Ever since I adopted him from the shelter, he has been my best friend, always by my side, especially during my worst times. As he grew older, people always complimented him on his large, fluffy white coat. He is such a beauty! Since he is my best friend and family member, I would do anything for him. I love him so, so much. Two weeks ago, I went on vacation with my family. I left Reggie at home alone, hiring a trusted sitter to check in on him 2x a day, walk him, and change his food and water. You can only imagine the fear I felt when, while in another country, I got a panicked call from Anna, letting me know Reggie had been hurt! I was so scared and so far away from him. I'm so lucky I trust Anna - she told me that the came over one morning to take care of Reggie. She called for him, but he didn't come running as usual. After searching for him, she found him in my laundry room, hiding in a corner and whining. He had gotten into my sewing supplies, where I keep sharp needles, scissors, seamrippers, and other tools, and accidentally stabbed himself in the eye. He could barely open it in the pictures I saw. After calling me, she rushed him to the emergency vet who he has been seeing for years, where they found out he had a hole in his cornea. Luckily, since it was found quickly, they were able to do surgery to save the eye. I still had a few days left on my trip, which I tried to enjoy, but it was hard. Thank goodness Reggie is okay now, after taking meds and wearing a cone and eye patch for a few weeks. Next time I will have to put my supplies away much better, he gave me such a huge scare.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6A012LJ7,0.0

It was around 4 in the morning and I suddenly had the worst stomach cramps I had ever felt. I at first thought it might be gas or a muscle strain, but it ended up being much worse. I kept just dealing with the pain tossing and turning until I got the sudden wave of nauseous that I needed to throw up.  Once I was in the bathroom throwing up still holding on top the pain in my stomach I knew something was wrong. I knew I couldn't drive myself to the hospital and I didn't want to call an ambulance. I knew my dad leaves the city to head to work early in the day so I asked him to please pick me up and bring me to the emergency room. By this time it was about 6:30am in the morning. When I got to the emergency room they asked me a lot of questions mostly thinking it was gas or food poisoning. Once they saw how much pain I was in they gave me an IV with some pain medicine and told me I would be getting a Cat Scan done to see what was going on. The results from the cat scan were that my appendix was inflamed and was in danger of rupturing and needed to be removed immediately.  Within about 30 minutes of the cat scan results I was in the surgery room. It was very scary because I was all alone and given how sudden and fast paced everything was going I didn't have time to call anyone. Plus it was now about 9am in the morning and I knew anyone I called would be starting their work day. Rather than distributing anyone's work day I just under went the surgery alone without telling anyone. Once I awoke from surgery and everything was fine I called my dad and sister to let them know and ask that they go to my house for me and feed my cats. I had to stay overnight in the hospital to make sure I recovered ok.  I ended up being out of work for just about a week and was overall really lucky I went in when I did. Had I ignored the pain my appendix would of ruptured causing alot of damage.",386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZF106QX,,0.0

For my whole life, I have had a fainting disorder. My doctor thought it might be a condition called POTS. It took months to get a cardiologist to order the test, for some reason. They seemed to test me for everything else first. I eventually went to a heart hospital and had a test called a tilt table test. In this test they strap you to a table, with a pillow behind your head. You lie down for a while, and then they tip up the table to an angle less than 90 degrees. For about half an hour you just stand still and everyone waits to see if you are going to have symptoms. I didn't think I was going to have any, and the test was almost over. When I had finally decided I was never going to faint, I did. The nurse asked me how much I remembered. I said, ""I remember saying I feel weird."" She replied, ""Wow."" So I have no idea how many things I must have missed between passing out and coming to. I was so grateful that I had proven this condition to the medical community that I was laughing and joking around with the four people who had been monitoring me. I was really grateful, and so grateful, that I was just happy. I did feel awful once I got home, but it was also a relief to finally know I would be getting some answers to a lifelong health problem.",386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0Z7WI6QX,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0Z7WI6QX,0.0

I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholy about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. My mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. I got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. It was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.",384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59JKL0SW,,0.0

I went down in the evening to cut a cake with my parents. I thought that since no one remembered I wouldnt bother inviting anyone else.

Then we decided to do a fun activity that none of us has ever done before. We landed on horseback riding. Found a place in the mountains just above central city, and bought an hour long ride. We had about an hour to kill before the ride, so we stopped at a casino just below the mountains. I played slots for an hour. The drinks were complementary, but they really aren't. You end up paying for them when you dump your money in the machines lol. 3 beers cost me $100+. We then made our way to the place somewhat high up in the mountains. Our instructor was very young...maybe 18, but the way she rode her horse was simply remarkable. The experience is vividly memorable in my mind. There's nothing like hearing the wind blowing in the mountains....sounds like a train or a really fast car going by you at a high rate of speed. I was really enjoying myself until a younger trainer started to yell at me. I didnt know what was wrong until she told me that I hadn't been holding the reins the whole time. The horse was just following the others and I had no control over it. Even though the ride didn't go perfectly, it was easily the most enjoyable time of my life.",386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGT3LJ8,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AGT3LJ8,0.0

He had been with me during some of the post painful periods in my life, and I couldn't imagine life without him.  The regular medicines were not working, so we put him on a newer med that I heard could give Pip a couple of extra years, the downside is that they also came with horrible side effects for some dogs.  I think that we all imagine that our pet will not be part of the 20% and that it will be the cure that wee are looking for.  Pip initially responded well and he seemed to be getting back to his old self.  However in a couple of weeks, symptoms, started to show again and we had to up the dose.  A few days later, Pip seemed uncomfortable while I was getting ready for work.  After I dropped the kids off at school, something told me to go back to the house and check on him.  He was lying on his side, foam going from his mouth, panting...the worst part was that there seemed to be a look of terror on his face.  I will never forget that look or forgive myself for giving him those meds.  Pip was put to sleep later that morning.  I continue to research the medication that I had given him to see if anything pops up that I should have noticed before giving it to him.  It's like I can't let go.  It's almost like I have to find ways to continue to punish myself because I am the one who caused that look of fear in his eyes.

It was beautiful. The hiking paths were strenuous but we finished and had a nice lunch.  There were so many paths to cover and canyons to explore.  The day was overcast.  A few peaks of sun.  It was around winter time.  Winter time in Georgia is nice and cool.  There were just a few others in the canyons.  They seemed to also be enjoying themselves. There were many look out points and photo ops.  The canyons formed from poor farming techniques.  There are still cars from the 50s parked in the very spots they went out of order.  We look forward to do doing this again.  It was a great family adventure.,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DXJYR0X,,0.0

He has adjusted well for never having gone to a preschool or daycare before and now being part of an educational program. I had been worried as he had only been partly potty trained and one of the requisites was for them to be fully potty trained. However, after the 1st week of school he quickly learned what he needed to do as I assume he saw friends and classmates doing the same. I was so excited and relieved to have that done and take care of. He has created a bond already with the teacher's aide and asks about her each day he doesn't attend school, for example, during the weekends. I really like his teachers and I like that he is part of a relatively small class with only 10 students. It has been a bit hard to get him up early for classes as he is not a morning person. He takes after his mother in that way! However, with a bit of exaggerated excitement on my part he gets going in the morning with my help. We try to have as much ready the night before to make it a smoother, less stressful and rushed process. So far so good. I think this is going to be a great year for him and I am excited about what he is going to learn and that he is making friends and already mentioning some of them by name. A play date or a birthday party would be a great next step for the kids to create a deeper bond. I am grateful he is a part of this school and I have high hopes for him this year. I am very proud of how well he has adapted to this change and new chapter in his life.",38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LPYFOMU,,0.0

The same restaurants we usually visited, the same activities we always did, snorkeling, adventuring. But something was different this year. This year, my daughter now a full blown teenager, wanted nothing to do with us. She was not mean,vindictive or anything else. She just was not my little girl anymore, she was growing into a mature adult. She had her own plans, that did not really involve us anymore. As soon as we arrived, she had an old friend she wanted to meet up with. That was fine, we could manage without her. But, as it turned out we would only see her a tiny fraction of our summer. We knew who she was with, and that she was safe, but, we would very rarely get a chance to interact with her, except through text. I hate texts.",,38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LQ0OMO6,0.0

We celebrated our third wedding anniversary. We like to make sure to commemorate such events because it helps us to take time to pause and reflect on the status of our relationship as well as the good and bad things we've been through together. We are planning a big trip for our fifth anniversary but for this less monumental third anniversary, we decided to just celebrate by going to dinner at the resort where we were married. The anniversary was on a Tuesday night, so we didn't think the resort would be crowded and we were correct. We had reservations for 7 PM and I was able to leave work early that day to get my hair done for the occasion. I also had a special teal dress that matched one of our wedding colors. The resort was not crowded so we were able to get the best seat in the restaurant. We had a table overlooking the pier while the sun set. It was a beautiful blaze of orange and pink and reflected wonderfully off the water. I took a few photos to remember the view. We ordered some drinks and our dinner. Service was great because the restaurant was not crowded so our waiter was not juggling too many tables. The food was excellent as it always is at that restaurant. After we ate, we wanted to go to the exact spot where we said our vows. There's a large field next to the pier. Of course, the scene was not the same as wedding day as no arch was set up but we were able to find a bench near the exact spot where we could sit and look at the water in the moonlight while we talked about the first three years of our marriage and what we see for the years ahead. It was nice to have this private, dedicated time to reflect and enjoy each other's company.",,38BQUHLA9XMXO3UVU3OYPP2LNHBOMQ,0.0

When I first retired, I felt like I was leaving my job under a cloud.  I had received a bad evaluation, and my decision to leave was prompted as much by this as it was by positive emotions.  As a result, I felt like I was leaving as a failure.  I worried that without work as a source of meaning, my life would become empty. I did struggle a bit with these feelings of failure and emptiness, but it didn't last long.  I quickly discovered that my family needed more attention than I had been giving, and that serving my family provided more meaning than work ever had.  I have two children in college, and they were both struggling emotionally.  My wife works far more than anyone should, and feels unable to leave her job.  Because of this, there was a hole in the emotional center of the family.  I have worked to fill this hole, with some success.  As described by one of my sons who has already left home, ""The family is back in balance.""Looking back on my last day, I left with some trepidation.  I was in some ways unwilling to admit how nervous I was about this new life stage and new status.  I remember the sense of closure as I said my goodbyes, but what I didn't realize was that life would definitely go on, in new and better ways.  I might not see the people I was acquainted with at work any more, but I would get to know my family in new and deeper ways.

After being at the same job for 25 years, I worked my last day. I had thought long and hard about this decision. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I made a good living, but I was bored with my job. Plus, I would miss seeing the same friendly faces every day. But I wanted more out of life. I wanted to travel and spend more time with my family. I wanted time for myself. My company was having a big retirement party for me. They laid out a big spread of food and there was a delicious retirement cake. My company gave me a watch to thank me for my 25 years of service. On top of that, my boss gave me some new luggage that he said I could use with all the travelling I wanted to do. The biggest surprise of all, was that all the employees chipped in and paid for a trip to Italy for my husband and I. They were really sending me off in style! I could not believe it. After the retirement party, I went and finished packing up my office. I was more emotional than I thought I would be. My coworkers that I was closest to, came by to give some private good byes. I had special gifts for all of them. I knew we would stay in touch, but we would not be chatting everyday any longer. The time had come for me to leave my office for the last time. I had such mixed emotions as I walked out that door. Now, one week later, as I am packing for my trip to Italy, I know I made the right decision. There is so much more to life than working, and I am ready to get out there and live my life to the fullest!",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UG617H9,0.0

As you know, I am scared to death of water slides. I hate them with a passion. Especially the covered ones that seems like they are miles long. It might be because I don't  like feeling trapped, I don't really know. I did decide to go with her. When we arrived, there was a massive slide that had so many twists and turns in it that it was very intimidating. I was scared of it. However, my friend's fearless daughter looked at it and said ""That's child's play."" and stood right up to the line for the slide. She went down it a few times before dragging me with her. I didn't want to. I could feel my heart racing and myself getting more nervous. She told me ""Are you a chicken?"" and I told her no. She said ""You look like one."" and I had to prove to a 5 year old that went down the slide a few times that I can do it one time. It got to be my turn, my palms were sweating and knees were weak. It was so high up and the only way to go down and down the slide. I got in the tunnel, gulped, and went down. It was over before I knew it! I heard ""See, chicken. That wasn't that bad."" and got dragged a few more times on the slide. The more I did it, the less scared I was of it.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UH1L7HK,0.0

Since it was the big 10 and finally those double digits, we wanted to do something special for him.

We told him to inviate all the freinds from class if he wanted and anybody else that he had in mind. We as parents, also included the parents in on a lot of this since its as much a vacation away from the kids for some, as it is for hanging out and drinking with the other parents can be just as much fun. My son always has loved the fiar on the baord walk. It was a lot of fun to go there as we have always been going his entire life. He loves going on the ferris wheel and playing all the carnival games they have there. We try to do our best to make sure he doesnt get too too discouraged playing the games though! After the fair, we took a trip to his favorite noodle bar. He loves being able to choose his own dinner. Mom usually keeps a tight lease around us at dinner time, so whenever he gets a chance to do his own thing, he absolutely loves. Afterwards we all went home and opened presents with him. Some kids choose to leave early since it was a long day, whereas others wanted to come over and hang out in the pool. Overall, i would like to imagine the little guy had an amazing birthday, atleast according to how fast he went to bed that evening and fell asleep, I would say he did as well!",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UBKHH7M,0.0

He tells us that's how the Japanese do it and we cannot tell him off. When we went to the board walk their is a large fairground. It has mainly adult rides. He is aged only 7 and his very tall for his age. He showed no fear and wanted to ride all of the adult rides where as a lot of his little friends did not.

The reason I say this is because at that time something happened that changed my outlook on life.  My husband and I were driving on a trip to Boston up north and almost got into a car crash. This was a turning point in our lives to be honest. I say this also because that alone changed my way of thinking on two fronts. The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me. I looked at things differently after that day and so did he.  We started to focus more on the time we have here because having that happen was eye opening to us both. I almost cried as I watch the night end tonight as we go into the New Year because if things had gone different in that crash him or I could be alone. So in turn be thankful everyday you are alive because things can change that in a second. Also take in each day and cherish what you have and know that it can end just as quickly. Please also don't live in fear because life is short so love the time you have here. Lastly, the most important thing is while it's okay to be scared live life, but give yourself time to realize that you need to love and hold the ones you have everyday and thank the lord you have that time.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UJPH7HU,0.0

For many years I have focused my studies on female empowerment as well as women's rights, so it was an honor to be asked to speak.  I was exceedingly nervous leading up to the event; I had written my speech as well as made my presentation before but this time it was different.  The attendees at this conference were a lot of big names in my city as well as community.  I spent the weeks leading up to the presentation studying my material and going over my slides; I had it down perfectly.  When the day finally came, I was so nervous.  I paced my hotel room for hours going over the material in my head, I visualized it going perfect in my head.  The ride down the elevator to the ballroom and walking to the room felt like it took hours, but once I finally got to the podium all my emotions went away.  I knew my material and I was so excited to share something I was passionate about to some people that I really cared about and were foremost in their field.  The presentation went off without a hitch and I received a lot of great questions from the audience.  A one hour presentation felt like it went by in seconds!  After I finished, I was greeted with a strong applause and a lot of smiles and cheers.  I felt so proud of myself and so excited that it was done.  I met many of my colleagues afterward and they congratulated me on a well done presentation as well as great material.  I was asked to speak next year as the keynote and I could not be more excited.  All of my hard work, patience, and excitement paid off.  I am already looking forward to next year and cannot wait to share more stories and information with my colleagues.",,38F71OA9GUI3IQH2V0582VT7YZ2MFP,0.0

The kitten was nice and warm in my hoodie. An older lady was there, looking tearful at the desk. I did some eavesdropping and figured out that she had just put her older cat down. A light bulb moment. I didn't waste any time thinking about whether or not this was a good  idea. Before I could tell myself to mind my own business I said, ""ma'am are you interested in adopting a kitten?"" She wiped her eyes and looked at me cautiously. I pulled the little kitten out of my sweatshirt and she couldn't help but ""awwwwwww. poor little guy."" I knew she was the one. Maybe there was a higher power who put us together that day.

It was covered in ants! It's also so hot here in south Florida that I knew he would die if I left him outside in the bushes like that. I wondered where his mom and litter mates were. Was he abandoned for being sick or injured? Did the mom cat get run over or was unable to come back for kitten for some reason? I used a Gatorade to try and wash off the ants because it was all I had. The kitten had blue eyes and it was crying loudly, the kind of cry a human baby makes when it's really in distress. I know you should not pour any cold water on a kitten that age because they can't regulate their body temperature, but it was a quick decision to pour the room temperature Gatorade on the kitten just out of desperation. I took the kitten home and spent so much time bathing him and then even used a blow dryer on low to make sure it was completely dry. There were dead ants and some fleas in my bathroom sink when I was done. I got a cat carrier and some blankets, making sure he was all set up for the night, but was also really careful not to put him somewhere he would smother himself by accident. I got put uncooked rice in a sock and warmed it in the microwave to keep the baby warm. The Gatorade was such a bad, sticky choice, but I really didn't know how I was supposed to drive when there was a crying kitten and ants literally swarmed all over it. It's poor little eyes and butt had piles of ants and I knew the right thing to do, the only thing to do, would be take the kitten out of the parking lot. I really can't afford to foster more pets. It's so hard to find a rescue to pay for the vetting. This kitten needed about thirty dollars worth of supplies, a bottle and kitten KMR powdered formula, just to get through the next few days. He also needed to be fed and to help eliminate every two to three hours. That's twelve feedings a day and twelve times I had to help him pee and poop. Kittens are a lot of work! As I stood there in the parking lot though, I knew if I walked away he would die. That kitty ended up getting adopted three months later when he was about three and a half months old. I put all my time and money into him and then my neighbor's mother who lives in the city next to us adopted him. She calls him Bear and every time I see my neighbor walking her dog we talk about how fat he has gotten and how much her mom is obsessed with her kitty.",38SKSKU7R2J3MZ17WWAE5FRAEMIILO,,0.0

Four months ago, after several years of realizing he's a bit 'different' than most other children his age, the testing finally confirmed his ADHD. Am I surprised by this? No. Am I happy? Yes and no. Yes I'm happy that we have a diagnosis that seems consistent with what we know about the disorder. No I""m not happy that he is a child with ADHD. But, now he's treating his issue with medication. Unfortunately, we've gone through two different medications and have not found the right one for him. The first one has led to a weight loss that was not safe so he had to get off of it. The second one only partly seems to be working - there are still many, many issues that need addressing. We are continuing to meet with his doctor and to do everything we can do to help this child. This is a very emotional situation for my wife and me as for awhile we thought we had a trouble maker in our home but now we realize we have a child with an actual disorder.

They were a tough crowd. So then I did my rabbit trick which kids seem to really enjoy, except it didn't go according to plan. My rabbit got stuck in the magic hat and started making sounds like she was in pain. The kids began to get upset. I pulled and pulled, but the rabbit wouldn't come out. One kid started crying. Mothers were giving me death glares. The rabbit finally came free but my show was a bust. I gave up playing magic for about a year. A friend of mine convinced me to do my act at her anniversary party. I left my rabbit at home. Amazingly it went really well. I added a few comedy bits and everyone seemed to really enjoy it.

We then went on to Arizona where we visited the grand canyon and stayed with family for a few days. This is where the 90's era van we'd been camping and driving decided to break. We had to perform maintenance on the van on the side of the road in Arizona. After that, we went to New Mexico to visit Roswell and camped for the night. Next stop, the gulf of mexico, and a friend in Texas. We stayed in our friend's driveway for a couple of days and got to camp on the beach where we saw a moon bow. Next stop, Louisiana, where we stayed with family to shower and get a good night's sleep in a real bed. We explored bourbon street and had an amazing time getting to the know the city. After Louisiana, we drove to Tennessee to visit another friend in Chattanooga. This was really one of the best parts of the trip as we never get to see this friend. After Tennessee, we drove back to Springfield, ending our trip.",3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDSEOP2A,3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDSEOP2A,0.0

She's California born and raised and is very much a valley girl. I was curious and, to be honest, a little amused at the thought of her adjusting to small town Missouri life. Especially because we are a lesbian couple and she's used to living in cosmopolitan Los Angeles where absolutely no one cares or notices a lesbian couple! I did tell her it's fine if we just pretend to be friends, but she was like no way, I love you and we're doing this. So we go home and of course my family doesn't care but we do get some stares. We stop and get gas in the middle of Nowheresville, Missouri and she asks me if I want something from inside the store and I'm like no, that's okay, but she's like are you sure baby? And squeezes my hand. That definitely brought some stares from the two other people at the gas station. When we're finally home, the house I grew up in, which is where my brother is having his wedding, her reaction to the food at dinner is hilarious. It's all fried and certainly not gluten free! But she is a trooper and so gracious so of course she ate it all and loved it because who DOESN'T like fried food. So then the day of the wedding dawns and the skies are so gray and I know it's going to rain, I just know it. I can FEEL the thunderstorm coming on. It's humid and the air is thick and my brother's now-wife had insisted on an outdoors wedding. Luckily we did have a lot of tents, so the rain did not get on us, but the wind did give us a light misting all over our nice clothes. I made a joke that we're all going to catch cold so this is the sickness & health part kicking in. But overall it was a wonderful wedding. My girlfriend and I danced to almost every song and it made me happy to see how far we've come as a society that no one judged us. Some people did make jokes about who wore the pants, etc, but I knew they were all in good fun. I also caught the flowers when my sister-in-law threw them at the bridesmaids! So...you know what that means!",,39ASUFLU6YTM6OGAEWNBVUO5Q9GEX3,0.0

All of my friends were there and we all got along very well. There were some events that stood out, but the one that was the most surprising was our very last night. We all drank a little too much, and it was an endless string of laughter and chaos. In that moment, I was really able to let everything go and just enjoy the moment. We ended up meeting several other people at the resort and drinking with them. Seeing as it was an all inclusive resort, we all drank to our heart's content, which was a bit too much. The next morning, I was very hungover and we had to catch a flight. The trip was definitely memorable and one of the best trips of my life. I had a great time bonding with everyone. The excursions were fantastic and really added to the experience. It was a special trip because I shared it with some of the closest people to me. The weather was great, and the food was amazing. All of the people we met were kind and generous. That night will be with me forever, and I will cherish those moments.",39DD6S19JQXBBJGPFEBWSF4GY90ZE7,,0.0

I had to sell it as an emergency because. I was about to leave it for a while, and the former owner never wanted to answer me for how damaged the car was when he lied to me saying that it is very, very good. With how little I am saved and how little I could get for the other car I decided to buy an agency.

Maybe that was what caused the car to start damaging so much ... well, I'm not a scientist to know. I liked it, I felt the king of the world. King Kong, everything controlled.

However, it was only kindergarten so he still felt like a ""baby' to me. This year however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. My little man is growing up so fast.

After 3 weeks of being home, we needed to have a family outing. We chose a park about 45 minutes from our home which was a local favorite for families with children. The weather was nearly perfect on the day we chose to go to the park. It was 75 degrees and sunny with very low humidity. The park was in down but in a secluded area. Although there were several other families at the park, the park is large enough and spread out so that we were not bothered by other people. Our youngest son was still sleeping for the majority of the day. Our two older sons were outfitted with their swimming trunks and water shoes. The park has a stream running through it which has a rock bottom. Kids are able to gradually hike up or down stream through the park and view several smaller waterfalls. It was a bit challenging to keep track of our two oldest sons (ages 1 and 4 at the time) because my wife was responsible for carrying our newborn. We had a chance to take several pictures of the boys playing in the water and enjoying their time at the park. We took several family photos which was our first opportunity to do so since our youngest was born. In the end, this was a very memorable day for us as a family and a great opportunity to spend time outside together.",39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QMTWV1Z,,0.0

We had talked on the internet quite a bit, and even shared pictures with each other but we'd never actually seen each other in real life. We'd talked on the phone, but that doesn't really show what a person is like. I was really nervous and had the whole thing planned out in my head how it would go. Of course, it didn't happen exactly as I planned. Luckily, it still went really well. My friend plans on moving to the area and being able to hang out with him for a few days really put my mind at ease. He looked just like his pictures and sounded just like he did on the phone, so I wasn't shocked or disappointed. He was actually much calmer in real life and I think our personalities meshed quite well. He brought along his dog that was even cuter than expected. I showed him around our area and he was surprised to see a lack of trees, but ultimately things were very similar to his hometown. He's from a large metro area and I'm from a smaller town, with lots of rural suburbs. The cost of housing surprised him and I thought for sure he would be disappointed by our lack of food choices, but he seemed relatively impressed. We ate at a few restaurants that I hadn't tried since I don't get out of the house much. I'm looking forward to having a friend close by, as most of my friends live across the country from me so we don't get to see each other often.",39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUPTJ4Y,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUPTJ4Y,0.0

The bad thing was that we had to drive down to Florida. We live in Minnesota. We rented a van, so we could all do together in one van. Packing about a weeks worth of stuff and fitting 4 people into a van was a task! We ended up fitting everyone comfortably and at three in the morning, started the long ride to the Keys. The drive seemed to take forever. It was filled with stopping and going. The traffic was a mess most of the way. So much of the roads we were on were being worked on, which meant that it was slow going. It took us 2 days to get there! Despite the mess of the roads and how long it took, it was worth the drive.

I drove with my family from Virginia all the way to Islamorada which took a total time of more than 16 hours over two days.  We stayed in the Keys for five days before returning home. The trip did not start out well. The weather was rainy when we first left Virginia and temperatures were cool. The traffic trying to go south out of the state was terrible. The drive after that point wasn't too bad, just very long. We stopped the first night when we got to the Ocala area. We didn't have reservations for a hotel, so we had to end up staying in a shady motel. The area itself was fine but the room was old and run-down looking. The shower didn't have any hot water and we found multiple bugs in the room. Thankfully we only had to stay one night before continuing to drive to the Keys. The next day we finally got down to the Keys. One of my most memorable moments was going over one of the first bridges. There were some rain showers around, but the sun was shining and the water was a beautiful, bright turquoise color. The hotel we had booked was much better than the motel we had stayed in and even had a small beach at it. We spent most of our time checking out the local beaches and going snorkeling on the jetties and reefs in the area.  All in all, I really enjoyed my time in the Florida Keys and the time I got to spend with my family. I would definitely recommend the area to others who are thinking of visiting.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVY00T8VP,0.0

Two months ago, I noticed a beautiful 4k television at a local store. I knew the moment I saw it, I must buy it. The great thing was the price. The store was offering huge discounts just before Thanksgiving. I bought the television and received a three hundred dollar discount. The day of the delivery, I was full of anticipation. I reconfigured my living room in order to make the space for my  prized purchase. It took approximately sixty minutes to unbox and set up the television. Immediately after it arrived, I called friends and family members to schedule a football watching party for the following Sunday. The day of the party was so exciting. Over twenty people came over to watch football and movies on my new television. Every one was amazed by the sound and video quality of the new television. The football field, players and referees were so vivid. It was just like being at the football stadium. Everyone asked, where I bought the television and how much it costs. No one believed that I received such a great discount on the television.

We decided to go to West Memphis, Arkansas to take in the sites and namely the dog racing at Southland gaming park. My job was to drive the rented van and to make sure that everyone got to the motel safe. It was me, Darlene M., Trixie S., Stacy R., Leeanna M., Amanda M.; McKayla A., Toya B. and Crystal W.. It was a great trip. Everyone took off work early on Friday. The drive was supposed to be 8 hours but I put the pedal to the metal and made it in 6 and a half. The facilities at the dog park were top notch as well was the motel. Trixie won the most money betting on the dog races and Leeanna won big at the slots. Friday night everyone got really drunk and we had to carry Crystal up the stairs to the motel room that night. Saturday we bet on dog races all day and took a break at the motel pool with cocktails and snacks. Then we cleaned up and went to the all you can eat crab leg buffet. Then it was off to the gaming floor. A few in our group danced and watched the casino house band. Sunday we slept in late, took in the motel continental breakfast and hit the road for a relaxed drive back to West Cleveland. We stopped in Branson, MO for some flying rolls at Lambert's cafe.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYBIIV8C,0.0

Friends and families getting together to share, and the children got to spend time with their friends. There was plenty of vegan inspired plates and platters! A personal favorite, is the steamed broccoli and tofu platter. Mm. Mm,Mm! The wife had her veggie burger on rye.

After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRD7VCK,,0.0

We left the restaurant after finishing our meals and saw a food truck selling ice cream across the street. We decided to get ice cream cones for dessert. We walked about for a bit while we ate our ice cream and chatted about different things. About an hour later, we found the perfect spot on the grass near a bridge with an open view of the sky.

The most memorable part was when they handed me the keys and said this is now your new home. I couldn't believe it was actually ours. I wanted to find something that was large enough for my family, but that there wouldn't be much upkeep. We are extremely busy people. The home is brand new from the factory and so is everything in it. So this is perfect for what we are looking for and needing, and it is all ours. Very exciting! I can't believe that we are actually home owners. While the searching wasn't the most fun part, and we are still moving, getting to have our own home is super exciting. I can't believe it is ours.

I was glad I got it, it tasted better than I thought it would. After we checked into our room, we took a walk on the beach.  We spent time relaxing in the sun.  We walked to Pleasure Pear and payed to go in.  One of the most memorable things was watching the dolphins play while we waited on the rides. They were playing with a ball that was in the water. It was like a group of kids playing with each other.  We laughed and seem to lose track of time watching them play. After a while I noticed there was a large group of people watching them instead of getting on the rides.  It was like they were the main attraction.",39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIGQ6HMA3,,0.0

I knew that if I ever wanted to make something of myself I would need to leave home and find my footing. My step father signed me up for college and I didn't have a choice so I went. It was a huge cultural shock but one of the highlights of my life. I literately made it through 5 years of college with only a little change in my pocket. I never knew that I could be proud of myself but when they handed me my diploma and everyone cheered I knew at the moment that I did something worthy. Going through high school was required but completing college was determination. I knew that I had done something to better my family and my future. We ended up eating at a restaurant when the graduation was over and my family gave truly emotional toasts in my honor. Even though their words were kind and inspiring I did not need them this time. I was actually proud of myself and what I had accomplished through hard work. I even interviewed for a teaching job a week later and was employed. We all face hardships but it's about determination and resilience. I knew I wanted to make a bigger impact on the world.  I hope that I impact my students lives like my others did for me.,,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIGYQLAM7,0.0

The weather was nice, so it was the perfect time to do so. First, we stopped on Connecticut to visit my sister, her husband, and our nephews and niece. She showed us their local community and we also went to an old toy museum. From there, we decided to go to Boston. We stopped in and saw the Cheers cafe. Boy, that was sure fun! My husband and I took our picture at the iconic Cheer's sign. We also stopped downtown to get some classic Bostonian food. Our last stop was Vermont. My husband's work is from there, even though he works from home. He showed me the little village of Woodstock. They had a cute little in and a covered bridge that looked like it was from the movie Beetlejuice. The restaurants and storefronts all had wood. It was so beautiful. For souvenirs, we took home Vermont maple syrup and their coffee. It makes our breakfasts so much better and reminds us of our East coast trip.",,39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTOUFIUH,0.0

We took the trip with very little planning, and just kind of decided where to go as we went along.  We visited many small towns and it was very beautiful.  At one point, we saw a mountain with a waterfall, and decided to go climb it.  It was really amazing.  We even found a place near the top where the water cascaded into a pool, and then out the other side of the pool to continue down the mountainside.  We took a dip in the water, which was ice cold.  As we drove along the coast we stopped in many little towns, and browsed around in some really cool antique shops.  We also visited a place in Canada with a giant lobster statue, because the place was considered the lobster capital of Canada, and of course, we stopped to have a seafood lunch with a lobster bisque soup that was out of this world good.  As we went up the coast and into Canada, even though it was already spring, some places were still snow covered and quite cold.  We even got stuck in a snowdrift on a remote highway, and had to wait hours until we got lucky, and passing by snowplow pulled us free of the snowbank with a heavy chain.  We ate poutine in a small french Canadian town in Quebec, and it was delicious.  I had never eaten cheese curds before, and they were really chewy and tasty!  My favorite part was all the little towns in New England.  They were so quaint and pretty, and in every one, there were these amazing antique shops full of odds and ends that really told stories of the history of the place.  I bought an old licence plate from a shop in New Hampshire that had the saying on it, Live free, or die, which I thought was really cool for a State slogan.  It was a great trip overall, and I cherish the memories of all the wonderful places we visited.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTOUFIUH,,0.0

I haven't been on vacation in years, and my dad decided all four of us should take a vacation, and spend a few nights at the Down Stream Casino on the Oklahoma Missouri border. Being with my closest family member's meant the world to me. We started out at my apartment in Tulsa, OK and we drove about an hour and 15 minutes to our destination. When we first arrived I bought some Ice Cream at the casino's Ice Cream stand for my Son and I. After that we got the keys to our room, and brought all of our luggage there. We shared two rooms, and the rooms were extremely nice, and comfortable to relax and sleep in. I stayed in one room with my son, and my parents stayed in another. I didn't participate in much gambling, instead we watched Ellen DeGeneres Game show, and stayed up late watching TV and having good conversation with my son, and parents. After that we drove to a local restaurant, and had dinner together. Then my dad took me on a tour of the casino, bar, and slot machines. He showed me the machines he likes playing, I played with 20 dollars, and ended up cashing out 40, so I made a nice little profit.  I will always cherish this vacation with my close family member's that I don't always get to see. Their kindness and love will always radiate with me, and I will always remember them choosing to spend time with me, and make my day that much better.

He had to make sure he was getting his point across. Overall, he was just abrasive, annoying, and extremely callous. I had had just about enough of the guy. However, he wouldn't stop. He was, for lack of a better term, a lunatic. He made all the other patrons feel unsafe and unwelcomed. In an area as holy as this place, that was a sin in and of itself. It was hard to imagine he was still around. I had tried to be understanding but everyone has their limits. Whenever I sought answers, excuses and shouting followed. It was truly uncomfortable.

He said, ""kiddo, I love you, I will always take care of you."" I thought he meant in the sense of how a parent loves their child after they pass away.

I never thought I'd find someone I enjoyed spending time with this much. I mean I'm usually a bit of a loner. I have friends and all but definitely not the kind of guy to go hang out every night. With Beth it is different though. We have a lot of the same interest so when we go out we have no problem coming up with something we will both enjoy. Even better we are both content to hang out watching movies or talking until late. It's been 5 months and I swear we might never run out of things to talk about. Not that we always agree but we both no that there are different ways to look at things and no way is 100% the only way. In fact I respect her opinion on many things that I don't necessarily agree with her about like economics. What really surprised me was that I found this great person at work. Who would have though my soulmate would turn out to be one of my colleagues. Especially at this gloomy office. I know I should be concerned about the possible consequences of dating someone I work with but honestly I'm to happy to care right now. Plus I'm sure if it doesn't work out we can both be mature adults about things.,,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RPGM9PT,0.0

Somehow an argument broke out between my aunt and sister. My aunt is very pro Trump and my sister is very against him. They got into an argument about Trump and it involved several subjects such as socialism and climate change. My sister stated that she would not have children because she believes they would not have a good future under climate change. My aunt stated she believes Trump is a better person than Obama. I wish that the subject of politics had not come up so we could have enjoyed the event, but it seems unavoidable these days. I was dissapointed by the turn of events. I also do not think anything fruitful came out of discussing the subjects. I had warned my sister not to discuss politics, but she did not listen.

Right now now I am going on about 2 months. I still can't fully bend my knee back past 90 degrees. And I still experience a lot of pain. The pain usually hurts the most at night and keeps me up sometimes. I am required to wear a knee brace all the time. But the brace is pretty uncomfortable and itchy so I take a break every chance I get. All in all right now this wasn't looking like the best idea.

A few months back my favorite cousin was sent back to jail. Sadly he tested dirty we went to his parole officer. What made matters worse was that his home was swatted and they found quite a bit of different drugs there as well. I live in a small town so of course this was in newspaper and featured the sheriff County's facebook page. There were a lot of negative comments stating that he was a horrible person and deserves jail time you name it they were saying it. But I know I love my cousin and things are just so black and white, if people kept open mind even know that he had a very rough child without a father and he got with the wrong crowd. When he got married 5 years ago he was clean and doing so well but there was a fire at his home and he had to jump out of a second-story when after saving his kids and wife. Because of this he hurt his back and got addicted to painkillers. And he started to smoke weed and two other drugs to take away his pain and progressing depression. I suppose if I didn't know the specifics behind it it would see my cousin. As a good or bad person (ie) a black or white mentality of his character. But most things in this life there's always two sides to every story which gives way to gray areas of life. I just wish more people saw the world this way.

While I was there, I wanted to go for a hike and found a trail in Lamar Valley so I decided I would take some time to go. The trail was so nice and peaceful, but as the sun started to set, I started hearing some heavy footsteps nearby. I stopped in my tracks as I didn't know if it was another person or an animal. In that moment, I really wished that I brought someone with me. I was getting really nervous and scared of what I would see. I was completely surprised when I saw that a BEAR had walked close to the trail. I tried to stay calm as I tried to think back to what I knew about bears. I stayed quiet so I didn't bring the attention to me. I slowly walked away while trying to stay light on my feet. My heart was pounding the entire time. The bear kept moving further along the trail so I went back towards the entrance so I could get back to safety. Luckily, I was able to get far enough from the bear that I could walk normally the rest of the way. That was one of the scariest moments of my life. I am so thankful that I got out of that situation unharmed. Hopefully I don't ever come into a situation like this again!",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RZ5L9PG,0.0

After 6 years of marriage with my wife, we decided to separate. There are some things in life that cannot be reconciled, but when it comes to children, sacrifices must be made. A few months prior to our separation, my supervisor at the electronics factory advised me that I would have to begin working overseas in China due to the increased costs of production in our country, and if I refused, I would lose my job and status in the company indefinitely. I was devastated to hear this, my supervisor of  10 years put me in this tough situation of choosing whether i leave my family or leave my job. There were many things to consider, first off, after working under this supervisor for about a decade, I accumulated quite a lot of pay raises and perks to my job that made living easy for my family and I, and it wasn't easy to find the same things in another job. With my family, my daughter recently started middle-school and at this time in her life, it would be beneficial for her to make stable friends and develop relationships that last throughout her life. My wife didn't  like the idea of moving overseas because of her losing her job and our daughter's social health not being right. I did not know what to do in this situation whatsoever. I was angry with my supervisor for not offering me another position in the United States or referring me to another organization. I was also angry with my wife since she didn't want to come with me to China and start a new life over there. While i understood her concerns about not living there, I was still determined to pick up this new job position and continue working for the same company. Even though I made this tough decision and I knew this would come, my wife and I decided to separate because of this. In all honesty, separating was the hardest thing for me to overcome emotionally. We could not come to terms and agree on how things should be and for the sake of my daughter, we decided that my wife and her would stay in the USA while i travelled to China and lived there to do my work.",,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZY0UCC34,0.0

There was no wedding planner and the only guests were the 2 witnesses that were necessary for the wedding to be considered official.  I didn't have an appointment with the stylist the morning of the wedding.  Rather, I pulled my hair back in an elastic tie and had my hair in a low pony.  I got my boys ready before I even got into the dress.  This involved fixing bow ties while I was still in a towel from the shower.  I wouldn't have it any other way, though.  I didn't like having all the attention focused on myself the first time around and it was nice to focus on others for a change.  As I mentioned before the road to the simple, yet happy occasion was one that was filled with gut wrenching guilt and sadness.  I don't believe anyone ever takes divorce lightly, especially when kids are involved.  The tears at night, the pain they express...none of that can ever be erased from my memory.  The tragedy of staying in a lifeless marriage would be to have my boys grow up to think that is how a marriage should be.  They both have huge loving hearts and it would be the ultimate failure of myself as as parent to stay and have their idea of love be tainted.   Their dad grew up with parents who have been in an acrimonious relationship his whole life.  He has never seen them kiss or show any affection.  He has only heard emotional and sometimes physical abuse.  I recognize that the cycle needed to stop and I felt that I owed it to my children to show what a healthy loving relationship looks like.  Now, my son, laughs and comments on how I'm probably going to tell my husband that I love him because we say those things to each other all the time.  That's how it should be.",39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZY0TJ3C0,,0.0

It was a Tuesday and I found that weddings are so much more simple when you plan for 2 witnesses and the entire ceremony can be texted in a video to your parents.  I found my dress on a clearance rack a few days before and there was absolutely no stress.  The entire ceremony took less than 5 minutes and afterward, my new husband, my children, and his stepson all went out to dinner at a great place downtown by the courthouse.  Though the day was exciting, I'm not going to lie that the road to get there wasn't marked with heartache and growing pains.  I was divorced about 4 years ago and my young sons still reminisce about the days when their parents were together.  The wedding meant that their dream of their dad and me getting back together was no more, and that is a guilt that I don't know if I will ever get over.  My parents will celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary soon and I feel it is so unfair that my boys won't have that with their ex and me. However, I feel it would be an utter tragedy if my boys were to grow up and feel that love meant that you don't ever talk to your wife, that you always roll your eyes when she's around, or that you never display signs of affection around her.  I love my children with a passion and they have huge and sensitive hearts.  I hold onto their letters that they have written over the years that are still stained with tears and I always ask myself...was it worth it?  The answer is yes.  When they see my husband and I together, they see laughter and love and my younger son will gleefully say to me, ""You LOOOOVe him.""  He never said that with my ex.  There was always silence in the house and their dad never talked to me.  I want my boys to know love and passion and to allow their sweet and sensitive hearts to not be jaded or grow cold.  I choose love and I know in time they will understand.",39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZY0TJ3C0,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZY0TJ3C0,0.0

Thankfully, the wedding went well. The reception was a great time. I caught the garter. I guess I'm getting married soon. Maybe that's what my boyfriend wants to talk to me about.

I had been working at the store for over a year now and I was doing great, I had gotten to the point that it was all second nature to me. I loved my job, interacting with customers has been great, my coworkers are the best, and I just really enjoy working here. I recently heard that a managerial job had opened up and they were hiring, I thought this is my chance. I've always wanted to be able to work my way up in a job especially one I enjoyed and that it would be amazing to get this job. I've been working so hard and trying my best so I really thought I had a shot but I over heard some of my coworkers talking and saying that Jenny, who has been here a little longer than me was probably going to get the job. I'll admit this hurt because I really wanted it and after hearing that I thought they are probably right. Jenny has been there longer and she does a good job and gets along well with our supervisors/bosses. I get along with them pretty well too just not to the point that Jenny does, but even though Jenny does her job well, I know I worked way harder, not to put Jenny down but I always work overtime and always volunteer for stuff. I had given up all hope of getting the job, I've had past experience in jobs that I've seen that usually the one the higher ups get along with or like the most usually got better treatment and jobs regardless of how well they worked before. I was really sad but one day my supervisor comes up to me and says ""Hey Sara, so we are looking in to hiring someone for the manager position and kind of looking at our options and we are considering you for the job."" I couldn't believe it, I honestly thought with everything I wouldn't be considered. I say ""Thank you, that's great."" She replies ""So you would be interested if we decided you would be a good fit."" ""Definitely!' I state. She laughed and headed back to work. I was so excited maybe I would get the job. I had been so excited but then time passed and no updates on the manager position. I was working one shift and it was a rough one, we had a sale and people really took advantage of it, I was exhausted when I went to leave that day, I noticed my supervisor talking with Jenny and she seemed so excited. I knew that was it she had got the job and I was so upset. Then next day when I came, I was in bad mood knowing I had missed out on the job, then my supervisor walked up to me and said what I didn't think I would hear. ""Sara there you are, I have got a surprise for you. We talked it out and have decided we would like you to be our new manager."" I was so shocked I didn't speak at first. ""Wait I thought Jenny got the position?"" ""No, not at all, you work so hard and always do great, we did consider Jenny but you always volunteer your time and customers love you, it only makes sense to make you manager."" ""Thank you so much."" I replied. I was so happy, it was the best day ever.",,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYYCAC30,0.0

Myself and my wife were interested in making experiments. Like that we decided to make experiments with real people. But we were not sure about the concept for the experiment. After many discussions we finally reached a topic for experiment. We decide to date other people by hiding the experiment details. We made this as a mutual decision so that no problems occur in future. We approached different persons and had date with them. I personally had more dates than my wife. The women I met were very formal and friendly. Though it was based on experiment one woman made a good friendship with me. At first I didn't know about this. She usually call me whenever she gets time. My wife came to know this one day when she attended her call. So we finally called that woman and conveyed the fact of experiment we made.,,39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGE5KGYFB,0.0

They made sure I got good grades in school and always kept tabs on my progress. After High School, I went on to get my Bachelor's degree in engineering. During my senior year and just before entering the Master's program, my girlfriend was pregnant. I was happy because I was going to be a father but upset because I would not be able to get my Master's degree. My parents were devastated and i'm sure that they were hurt. My girlfriend and I decided to marry and raise our child before returning to school. My parents hounded me for over 20 years to finish my education. I continually put it off until one day that I promised my parents that I would go back to school. The day came when my daughter received her Bachelor's degree in Biology and we made a pact to get our Master's degree together and that we were going to do it for her Grandpa and Grandma. I told my daughter that I promised them that I would get my Masters and now that they were gone, I was even more determined to keep that promise. On the day of graduation, before the commencement, I sat in the car with my Wife and silently cried. I knew that my parents would be so proud of me. I felt good though because I knew that my daughter was going to be right by my side. We walked up on the stage together and we walked off of the stage together.

Honestly looking back I dont know how I did it either. Regardless I remember sitting in the neurologists office and getting the diagnosis. I was numb. I was confused. I was upset. Most of all I felt defeated. You never expect a diagnosis like that at 42. I walked out in a fog and stayed there for quite a while. I have since come to learn that my life isnt over.

I wanted to make his ""Big 30"" special so I threw him a surprise birthday party.  I started thinking about this about 4 months before his birthday.  It's a good thing, too, because there was a lot of planning to do for it.  I enlisted the help of a few friends of ours to help make this night extra special for all of us, but especially for Joe.  He is such a sweet, caring guy who everyone loves so it wasn't very hard to get others to help me.We met one evening when Joe was working.  I kind of knew where I wanted to have the party already, if everyone else thought it was a good idea.  We all like to go to a local sports bar called Ike's.  They have sports on most of the time but they also have some local favorite bands we all enjoy.  Joe's birthday was on a Wednesday so we thought we should have it the Saturday before so he would really be surprised.  A friend of Joe's volunteered to keep him busy that Saturday.  That worked out great, giving the rest of us plenty of time to get everything set up in the back room at Ike's.  We decorated a little with some sports stuff and some black balloons.  Everyone showed up around 6 and milled around til we got the news they were on the way.  As they entered the bar, the bartender greeted them loudly enough so we knew it was time.  As they entered the room, Joe's parents were the first people he saw.  Behind him were about 20 others, all yelling ""Happy Birthday Joe!"", as loud as they could.  Everyone seemed to have such a good time and Joe was totally surprised.  At one point, the singer who was working that evening came in and sang Happy Birthday to Joe and we all joined in.  After the party, Joe's Mom came to me and told me she wanted to pay for everything.  She was thrilled about the party and happy to pay for it which was not expected but was very nice.  Joe and I were very pleased with all the people who came.  But Joe is a great guy and most everyone loves him.  He's a keeper.",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFCT32,0.0

It was hard to see and the streets were flooding and there was a lot of wind.  I was really nervous driving especially since there were so many trees blowing and limbs coming down.  There was also a lot of lightning.  I wasn't sure if I should keep driving or try to find someplace to stop for a while, but all the other cars were still driving so I thought it was ok to keep going.  It was the highway so it seemed safer than smaller local roads.  I was almost home when I saw someone soaked walking on the side of the road.  At first, I felt really bad that I was going to pass this person by because he looked so forlorn.  However, I was nervous about picking someone up because what if they were dangerous.  Also, I wanted to get home as soon as possible.  I don't know what made me stop, but I did and asked the man if he needed a ride.  It turned out to be someone living a few blocks from me.  He didn't want to get in at first and I admit I was nervous, but with all the rain the lightning I tried to convince him it wasn't safe.  He got in and was really wet!  I guess he looked like a businessman so I thought it would be safe.  As I started to drive off, I heard a huge boom and crack!  A tree and lots of branches fell right where my car was and where the man was walking!  It had to be good karma or divine intervention that saved us because we could have been crushed.  This whole experience made me more willing to help others and to reach out because if I were in that same situation, I would want to be helped.  Also, it was just pure luck or some force out there that had me find the man at the right time and drive away at the right moment without getting hit by the tree.  It was a scary even, but it shows that helping others can give you good karma!!",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,0.0

My mother was always complaining about feeling really tired and fatigued so she went to the doctor. The doctor ran some tests and her heart rate was seen to be very low which they believed to be the cause of her fatigue. They recommended that she get a pacemaker put in to help regulate her heart. My mother agreed to undergo the surgery. The day of the surgery arrives and I'm with her laughing and joking around before she was called back to be put under. We had no idea the trouble that was about to occur. We were told the surgery would only be about 30 minutes or so. So they wheel my mother to the back and give her anesthesia. From my knowledge, as I was not with her at this point, was that she was still awake when they wheeled her into the operating room and she began to have a panic attack when they put the surgery cloth or whatever you call it over her face which then lead her to have a pulmonary edema. A pulmonary edema is basically your lungs being filled with fluid making it very difficult to breathe. She was taken to the ICU immediately and remained there for about a week. She was able to make a full recovery but it was close to being an absolute disaster. It was one of the most frightening things I have ever experienced. She even ended up getting the surgery for her pacemaker done later on and thankfully no complications occurred.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,,0.0

This event was one that I shall never forget. I still wake up and wonder about our true purpose in life, and how we come into play when called upon. Things happen in our lives which we really do not understand. We certainly do not have full control over all aspects of our lives. The element of surprise is always a real variable for which can play upon our actions at any time, and any place. What took place recently for me was certainly an element of surprise for which I was called to action without warning, or preparation. What this event did prove to me was that our worth as human beings is gauged by what we know, proving once again that knowledge is a very powerful force which absolutely can save lives. One particular morning I decided to stop into a major store to check on something I was interested in purchasing. For no other reason would I have been there that day. The real reason perhaps may have been out of my control, as though I was guided there to be in place for my contribution to mankind. As I was strolling through the store looking for my item of interest, I could not help noticing that someone seemed a bit irritated and somewhat irrational in how they were communicating with another person. I didn't think much about it and continued about my business. Just moments later, it was obvious that this person was having some sort of medical problem due to their behavior and the apparent breathing problems that I had detected. I am CPR certified, and am trained on what to do in case of a medical emergency. Probably a good thing since there was not anyone else around the scene which I believe was in any position to help this person. I then took control and intervened immediately to check on the situation. As I had surmised, the person in trouble was an elderly man who had just collapsed, struggling to breath, and very incoherent to response. Immediately I commanded the closest person to call 911 and get help as fast as possible. I then evaluated the situation and began administering CPR until the medics could arrive. I noticed that the man had a medical bracelet  for which I instructed the caller to give that information to the 911 center to prepare the medics as they were en route to the scene. What seemed like an eternity to save this man's life while I was still in control, became like a major relief once the EMS team arrived, and took over. In short, The man lived without any severe consequences, and was doing great after a short stay in the hospital.

I knew her best when we were teenagers. We used to travel a lot to Chicago from Memphis is another friend's old Chevy II. During those times we would kid around and even sing songs. But I was careful not to be too forward with her since her mother was in the car with us. I was about nineteen at the time I first met her and I believe she was around 15. Her mother is now in her late 80s and Carolyn died in her mid-sixties. I felt so bad first that she died and secondly, that I had not tried to keep up with her over the years. I last saw her at a funeral of a mutual friend. She was still beautiful but she was with her second husband. I met her first husband at our book club meetings and I was surprised she would have chosen a man like him. He was fairly grumpy and not too smart. I had to compare myself with him and it made me think I would have had a shot with her had I tried to date her as an adult. I too, though, had two children with a spouse that I wasn't particularly suited for. It's a shame she died. She was beautiful, funny and kind.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR,,0.0

My mother is getting up there in her age, she's 83 years old. Recently she had been having problems with her heart. It pumps very slowly and and she always has a very pale look to her face. Eventually the doctors say she needs to receive a pacemaker to help get her heart pumping again. The day of the surgery comes and the whole family is there talking with her and keeping her company before the surgery. She goes into the surgery and then next thing you know she's being taken to the ICU. The doctors said she had a sudden pulmonary edema and her lungs had filled up with fluid. She could barely get any oxygen. What was supposed to be a simple surgery turned into a life or death situation. We all waited by and were emotional wrecks, we thought she may not make it through the night. Luckily the doctors were able to stabilize her condition. She also had the pacemaker put in after she recovered. She ended up staying in the hospital about two weeks so the doctors could monitor her. My family and I were so happy she managed to survive.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,0.0

It was a nice surprise because we haven't seen them in three years.  My cousin has a daughter that is one year older than my daughter.  They get along great and has kept in touch via social media through the times we have not seen them.  They got to spend so much time together and got to make some good memories.  We went on a hike one day and it was probably the best day out of their short visit.  We took all day on this hike and afterwards we stopped at an Italian restaurant to eat.  One of the days they were here, we had a cookout and the kids swam the entire day.  We hadn't made any dessert for the cookout so we decided to go to our local ice cream shop afterwards.  It was a nice treat for all because it was such a hot day.  Those of us who didn't go swimming enjoyed the ice cream even more because we got to cool off with the ice cream.  When they had to leave to head back to Michigan, everyone was in tears.  My daughter's cousin who was the same age cried the hardest.  I felt so sorry for her.

Because the process of submitting a proposal had taken place such a long time ago and because we had not heard anything from our publisher, my colleague and I felt certain that we would either have to re-submit the proposal to another publisher or abandon the project. We had spoken about the future of the project only a week or so before we were offered a contract. At the time, we were quite discouraged and planned to speak about our potential next steps shortly. Thus, when I opened the email, I was shocked. I immediately sent a message to my colleague who was travelling with her partner to share the good news. We were both very relieved and excited. Once we had had a chance to talk, we drafted a letter to the publisher expressing our gratitude. We also wrote to our contributors, thanking them for their patience. As we began to hear back from the publisher with details and from our contributors with excitement, I began to grow nervous. Though I had written several chapters for publication in similar volumes, this would be the first time I would also be editing the text. My nervousness and anxiety heightened my sense of excitement and I felt a new desire to work. What surprised me most was not hearing back from the publisher after having practically abandoned hope. Rather, it was the sense of renewed scholarly motivation that engulfed me that I found most surprising. Now, I am much more focused on my work. I feel grateful to enjoy this new energy, which has also carried over into my teaching as a general sense of purpose.",,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2YE5T33,0.0

I have known her mother for almost 50 years. I knew that her mother had two daughters and I knew them both, but I was closest to her oldest daughter , Carolyn. Carolyn and I were two of the young people that travelled with my religious group to Chicago. We were always going to Chicago in those days, which was about a 10 hour drive. Carolyn was fifteen and I was nineteen. Her mother always travelled with us. Carolyn was a beauty even in those days but I could not flirt with her with her mother so close. I remember all the times we had to change a tire in those days, since we were always having flats on the drive. She would help me and thus, we could spend some time alone, away from her mother. I think she liked me too but it was too risky to date, since she was still underage. She got married at the age of 18 and I did not see her for many years, since her husband was in the military and they moved a lot. A few years ago, a friend died and I saw her again at the friend's funeral. She was still beautiful but she was also married, this time to her second husband. It was great to see her. Then, last week in my book club, we happened to mention some things and I found out that one of our new members was her ex-husband, who I had never met. We talked a bit about her mother and he told me that Carolyn had two children by him. He didn't mention she had recently died. I only found out about a week later. She was in her early 60s but she died peacefully in bed surrounded by family. She died young but she led a happy life.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR,0.0

We were skipping rocks like Pappy taught us when we were little.  We went up to my aunt's cottage and she made us a peach pie.  We were going to go hiking but it rained and it was too muddy.  Mom was afraid we would slide all the way down the hill.  We also went to the ice cream place.  It has a giant cow out in front of it.  We used to call it the cow store.  I had a chocolate shake.  It is my favorite as usual.  Everyone else had shakes too.  We became sad knowing it was our last day at the cottage.  We would go to school soon.

My daughter is a year below their daughter and a year above their son so it is a perfect match.  They get along so well.  While they were here, we went on a nature walk and swam in the waterfall.  My daughter is homeschooled and her friends are limited.  Having her cousins here made her feel more involved.   They really got to act like kids and just enjoy themselves.  We had a cookout when they were here also.  The kids swam all day in our pool.  We got ice cream after the cookout.  Both cousins spent the night with my daughter.  I feel this was so important for my daughter.  She felt like she bonded with her cousins even more.  Since this event, they have been staying in touch with their phones.  They have a group chat with another one of our cousins who lives on the west coast.  It seems as if the other two cousins don't have a lot of friends either.  This bond makes them feel as if they all have someone to relate to that's in their same age group.  I really hope we get to go see them soon,  I think it would be great for all of the kids.  My daughter and her cousins actually have a lot in common so it makes it easy to get along.  We didn't sight see  a lot when they were here.  We really just hung out and let the kids play.  I think this was the best thing because it made them get to know each other more.  They had last seen each other when they were much younger so I didn't know how much they would have in common now.  They all call each other their best friends.  It definitely makes my heart melt when I see their bond.",39ZSFO5CA9I20087NSNF832TUF4JUZ,,0.0

We were going over there to meet up with my brother who is working in that area.  It was the first time that I have been out of the country.  It was a life changing event.  Every day was a new opportunity to experience something completely new.  It was great spending time with my family in an exotic local.  There was a lot of friendly people there and there was wild life and there were pretty girls everywhere.  It was exciting to learn about a new culture.   It was unlike anything that I had done before.  I wish that I could spend a lot more time in a place like that.  I have a different way of looking at things now.  I just enjoy being a part of the world and seeing things that I wouldn't see all the time.   The most surprising part was how different it made me feel about the way the world is.   I think about the number of different personalities in the world all the time now.  I imagine what it would be like to meet people from every different place.,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PJJM8HQ,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PJJM8HQ,0.0

I hadn't talked to him in awhile, he was up in Wisconsin and I'm down in Florida these days, but around this time we would always go to Summerfest together, so I thought I would reach out to him.  We talked about possibly making the trip next year and seeing some bands together.   I was glad I reached out and talked to my old friend.   Two days later my girlfriend and I went to the movies.  On the drive home from the movie I was browsing Facebook.  I scrolled past a picture of my friend Ted with the caption ""We will miss you.""  I thought for sure I had to be seeing this wrong.   I had just spoken to him.  Turns out he had an epileptic seizure and died.  It was sudden.  I was in shock.  It took me an hour to even process what I had just seen.  After a little while I had a drink and just hung out and listened to some music from bands I used to go see with my friend.  I reminisced about all the good times we had.   I started to feel grateful that I had just talked to him, but even more sad that we wouldn't be able to get together one last time for Summerfest.  One thing that has really stuck with me the rest of the summer, I need to be better at seeing and reaching out to friends.",3A1PQ49WVI3Q0XMJX4AALOHHG51H1V,,0.0

Her child was only 5 months and was found dead one morning due to suffocation. The funeral was rather bleak and lasted for several days. My cousin suffered severe depression after discovering her child and was extremely upset. The coffin was pure white and small. Listening to the priest talk about life and death made everyone feel a lot better including myself. After the funeral it rained and I did some introspection of myself and how I viewed life and death. I couldn't articulate how I felt about this particular death but I felt a sadness and wrote down all my feelings in my diary. I felt much better after that and found out that writing down words and feelings on paper can help you cope with a tragic and traumatic experience. After that day I started to help people more often. I volunteered at places and went to support centers to show my support. These days I go to the park and just draw with my notebook, Nature and Animals. It took a long time to truly accept what happened and I struggled to accept that death could happen to anyone at anytime. I know I will never be the same person ever again. But that is okay because I know I will be able to move on now that I have seen a death and accept it as a fact of life.",,3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PRRAH8B,0.0

She is 23 and was getting married to her high school sweetheart, so all around it was pretty fairytale as far as weddings go. The wedding took place at sunset on the shore of a lake in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and I had the privilege of walking my aunt, the brides mother, down the aisle. While I enjoyed spending time with my family I found it especially difficult to interact with anyone else in attendance. I can't say for sure why I struggle so much with events that are meant to be joyous, I only know that I have a difficult time allowing myself to feel happiness in conjunction with the happiness of others. For whatever reason, past sadnesses tend to bubble to the surface at these types of events. I think I've been to a few too many funerals. I was especially triggered by the father daughter dance, because the specific structure was inspired by the dance my sister and father did at her wedding. Neither my father or mother are alive anymore, so to relive that experience in a different setting was somewhat surreal and upsetting. I had to leave the venue to smoke a cigarette and collect myself. I know it's petty, but I kind of don't appreciate how my uncle co-opted this specific dance structure for both his daughter's weddings. I don't feel like he has proper ownership of it, and it's cheap and derivative. I don't like that I feel that bitter about something that is supposed to be joyous. I also can't help but be emotionally impacted to a large degree. I'm very happy for my cousin, and at the end of the day it was a learning experience for me. I was able to interact with a bunch of cousins who are younger than me and who i've always known as children. They're grown now and I have a good deal of pride about how their lives are progressing.

My sister and both took our kids together. Her kids are the same ages as mine. We went to see The Lion King. I remember seeing this same movie as a child with my parents and siblings. It brought back such strong emotions that I teared up right there in the theatre. The theatre itself has changed since I was a kid. The seats now are cushioned and recline. There's an ordering service for food and drink. Probably the biggest difference though was the high cost to see a movie. Despite the cost, we had a great time. This was 2 months ago now but I still think about it often. I remember that my youngest sat on my lap while my older child sat beside me and held my hand. My sister's kids did a lot of whispering back and forth at first but eventually settled down to watch the movie. The kids ordered some cookies to eat there and they were freshly baked while we waited. It was a memorable experience that I am excited to be repeating when the new Trolls movie comes out in March.",,3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YR4SULM2,0.0

I had actually just joined a couple months prior to that, and on my first night of working the overnight shift, I was told that the store was transitioning to new hours and my job was being eliminated.  I decided to stay on until the end of overnights.  The whole experience was interesting, oftentimes frustrating, quite challenging, and new.  I'd never worked in retail before so it was all a learning experience.  Even more challenging than that, I pushed myself very hard and my body struggled to keep up.  My knees were regularly swollen to the size of softballs, my back constantly ached and my fingers were all cut up from tearing corrugated cardboard.  Despite these challenges, I came to really like the crew I worked with.  They were good people and usually hard workers, even if they weren't from my background or didn't occupy the same social strata as me.  But we got along and had fun and felt like we were all in it together.  The overnight shift is challenging, both because of having to stay up all night and simply because you're asked to get more done because you're working in an empty store.  Plus, we were badly understaffed.  But that struggling means you bond more with the people you work with.  And so, even though I'd only worked with these people for a couple months, we all felt very close and found our last night together very poignant.  We were all scheduled to work that night and it was what I call ""good bull.""  We laughed and joked with each other all night.  There were no hard feelings, no hurt feelings, no criticisms.  It was just a bunch of people working together, knowing they likely wouldn't see much or anything of each other going forward, and enjoying each other's company.  We all took our final break together and joked that the last item of the night should be stocked as a team.  We should pass it between each team member and then the most experienced team member should put the item on the store shelf.  Someone then joked that they should drop it and we all laughed.  At the end of the night we all felt good because we'd finished all the freight.  It was nice to finish with a ""win.""  We then went to the break room to get our stuff and go home.  We all shook hands and thanked each other for the work we'd done, and told each other what a pleasure it had been to work together.  I was still the ""new guy,"" but I really felt part of the team and was sad it was ending.  I liked working with these people and felt it was a tight-knit group, and I still miss suffering with them.",3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRKIGMLL,3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRKIGMLL,0.0

I've actually had a heart attack previously. That was a full on STEMI with a complete blockage of my RCA and all the bells and whistles of a typical heart attack - basically a fireball in my chest. This time it was more of a slow crackling fire with a few spurts here and there. Anyways, I really wasn't sure it was a heart attack, but I got a little bag ready and call the ambulance. My blood pressure was 200-something over 108 in the ambulance and they said the EKG looked fine. At the hospital no one actually told me I had a heart attack. After about an hour or two sitting there I felt fine. A little winded, but otherwise no pain. They wanted me to stick around to MAYBE do a heart cath, but that would have been another two days in the hospital and as I said I was feeling fine. So I left. The nurse was a bit annoyed since this was against medical advice and she actually pulled my IV out the wrong way causing my hand to bleed heavier than normal which ticked me off. Otherwise no one came to tell me I had had a heart attack. I found out almost three weeks later when I checked my records online which showed a diagnosis NSTEMI. Needless to say I wish there was a different hospital that was closer.",3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRS73MLU,3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRS73MLU,0.0

I went downtown with a friend to go see his new office, yeah? It's in a pretty decent part of town, but for some reason there's homeless people everywhere! On the corners, on bus stops, everywhere! You can't go three steps without seeing another one! One of them had even parked himself on the office doorway! He had his food out and was eating and looked like it'd take him a while to get done, too. My friend tried to shimmy past him, but the guy got real upset about being ""interrupted"" or whatever, like, dude, go eat on a park bench or something! My friend got into an argument with him about the whole thing, too. That really just made things worse, though. The man got really really really angry and started growling at us! He abandoned his food, grabbed rocks from the little...little garden thing by the door and started chasing us with them! We barely got back to the car in time before he'd have pelted us both! Before I could get in the car, though, he nailed me on the back of the head! My friend had to take me to the clinic to get stitched.

Before this, I was not really that into listening to classical music or anything of the sort. Obviously, I was aware of such famous composers as Beethoven, but during this performance I was introduced to many new artists. One of my favorite pieces that was played is called ""Fantaisie Impromptu"", by Chopin. It really is impressive how fast the song is, and just the scale of notes that are played with both hands at the same time. Another great piece of music that was played is called ""Amoreena"", by Elton John. I was never a fan of Elton John, but I remember hearing his music in movies and thinking it always blended very well. This song stuck with me because the piano melody in it is very well executed. I never liked this song when I was a kid; but now, looking back it was more original than anything coming out now a days. One of the mysterious pieces I happened to enjoy was called ""Asturias"" by Isaac Albeniz. It reminded me of people running into a battle that nobody wanted to fight but everyone had to. When I first heard it, I remember thinking, how can someone think of making music like this? Well, The last piece of music I can remember hearing at this performance was Beethoven's ""Sonata No. 23"". As anyone would guess, it was a great piece of music, developed by one of the greatest composers. I can very much say that I am now permanently a fan of classical piano. I encourage everyone to seek out the great composers of the past, and find pieces of music they can assimilate with.",,3A7Y0R2P2PAUH422SXY2SA1XVHYXJT,0.0

This experience helped me to realize that I was doing the right this. I comparison, the classes that I am TAing for now are not as good. I think the students appreciate me but I will maybe not get that level of feedback.

Numbers came easily to me and so did math. When I was asked to TA a class over the summer I was a bit apprehensive because I didnt know what I was supposed to really help with. The professor teaching the class really struggled with explaining things in a meaningful way. Those that took an interest in learning came to me and loved my explanations. I was told 3 weeks ago by the school that they had gotten many glowing positive comments from the students. They were very appreciative of how i listened to them and helped them. it really made me feel good about how I teach and what i could do to help. I am considering doing another course in the fall provided I can get the job back. I also considered getting an adjunct job after graduating with my masters. Sometimes its a matter of taking the time to listen to the needs of others. It was humbling to be involved in such an impactful way. I will always remember the kind comments I got. I hope others can learn from me and share what I shared. Overall this was a very positive experience.,,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH858MJZM,0.0

They said it's a dangerous world out there. Out there on the corner. But I told myself ""I'm going to be ready.""  I've waited 17 excruciatingly long years for this. And I'm not going to mess it up.

We were able to have our children be watched by their grandparents for the weekend. We took a trip out to Asheville, NC and stayed in a high end hotel on the outskirts. We planned this trip in the beginning of February so that we could request time off from work and arrange childcare. We both got out of work early on Friday and dropped the kids off at my parents. We drove up to Asheville and walked downtown before we checked into our hotel. After we checked in we unpacked and went to dinner. After dinner we took a warm bath and relaxed watching one of our favorite shows. We were able to enjoy other throughout the weekend while taking our time and do things on our time. We ordered room service and enjoyed our time kid free. This experience was memorable because there are few moments since we had kids that we were completely kid free. My parents never texted and we didn't hear from the kids in two full days, which is rare for us. We were able to go to shops that we used to enjoy without kids and eat a relaxing dinner. What was also memorable is how we were able to reminisce about times before kids. We also missed the kids, but were able take time to relax. As a parent, it is hard to even go to the bathroom without kids bothering you, so this was a much needed break.",3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH84N3JZW,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH84N3JZW,0.0

My last job was in the medical field in 2002, which was also the year I was married. Shortly after getting married, I needed a major surgery. Little did I know that that surgery would lead to side effects that would last the rest of my life. But, that story is for another time. 5 months ago, I found a job that allowed me work around my medical limitations. It has been a bit of a shock to realize how difficult it was to get back into the flow of work after so many years of my own activities. I do have some freedom in my schedule as long as I get the correct amount of hours in each day. I struggle every single day with my lack of attention span and trying to focus on the computer. But, every day has become better. There are some days that I am putting in extra hours because the job can be fun! Most importantly, I am proud of myself. Being a housewife for more than 15 years isn't something I was proud of. I don't have kids, we didn't have much money. I was home because of health problems and no other reason. It was embarrassing when I would run into people I hadn't seen in years and they'd ask what I did for a living. I always joked it away by saying things like ""I'm lucky enough to be home all day!""But now that I'm working and bringing in a steady income I am happy! I feel like I'm doing something with my life. I have made more money in 5 months then I did in almost 15 years combined! And when people ask me what I'm doing now? I can tell them about my job and they are interested! I feel like I finally have an identity after years of being a doormat. I can't even express how emotional that can be.",3A9AA95ATX8H1WLQH4KRXNWPCL95PF,3A9AA95ATX8H1WLQH4KRXNWPCL95PF,0.0

I usually do not go too many places too often with her, but still do go to stores (shopping and etc. mostly). We went to some Dollar Tree type store since it was right across from where my mother lives and I was visiting her. I recall browsing around the store (was about 2 months or so ago) and my mother just looking/sifting through knick knacks and whatnot. I then remember seeing this old woman with an interesting but odd set of clothing on her in the store. I didn't think too much of it, but a pretty unique and memorable experienced soon occurred. While my mother was paying/in-line and I was just waiting for her, I came across/walked right beside this old woman with the unusual attire (sort of like a flashy/unusual blouse; her hair done in an upright/spiky-esque way; colored pants; some ornaments on her shoulders and etc.). I remember reaching out for something near the woman (not on purpose) and me grabbing something that interested me, but then I had dropped it. The old woman right away bent down and picked it up for me. I thought nothing of it, but just thanked her and she continued to walk past me. Soon after she turned back and started engaging in conversation with me. She did speak mostly Spanish, but when realizing I didn't know much of it, she changed to English and could speak it somewhat well. I remember this experience with her to have somewhat of a ""feel"" of ""ambiance"" to it with her. I felt pretty much in an odd but not uncomfortable situation when conversing with her. She had some sort of ""air"" to her if you will. She mostly only talked about religion (she was Christian) and such. She finished the conversation off by grabbing my hand and smiling, saying something to the tone of, ""God loves you in his own way,"" or such. She then walked off and I then proceeded to leave with my mother, talking briefly about the experience/exchange with the woman. While I didn't talk about it once or feel it to be particularly special at the time, I kind of felt that it was pretty unique and interesting how we conversed back and forth (the woman was pretty calm and understanding -- not hesitant or in a rush or anything and basically very casual/comfortable speaking and such). I soon thought back to the event and that somehow made it feel more unique as some time had passed. Basically, the idea from this experience was that it was special in both the unusual attire of the woman -- and in her absolute kindness/peace/exchange experience with her. She was very different in her mannerisms than others and that's what struck out to me more than anything, but it was all enveloped in a package deal of just memorability and uniqueness.",3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH858LZJ1,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH858LZJ1,0.0

I realized that I soon had to catch the bus, so i stopped and waited at the bus stop. At the bus stop, i met a man named Casey. Casey was a young homeless man. After talking to him, I had great pity on him. Casey lost everything in the financial crisis, and he had no family left. After talking to him for a while, I realized I had to do something. I offered Casey money, but he would not take any. I decided I should invite him back to my place. I live alone after all. I told Casey he could sleep on my couch that night if he would like to. Casey came back to my house, ad we watched Netflix for a good while. As he shared more about his story, I felt my entire life perspective change. I realized that i took so many things for granted.

It all started right after the 4th of July of this year. I took some days off to travel with my friends over the holiday. It was a great time and we made a lot of memories. As soon as I returned to work the first day after the holiday break I started feeling terrible. This feeling was much worse than I had ever experienced. I felt dizzy and had some horrible chest pain -  I thought I was dying from a heart attack. I thought to myself, ""How could this be happening to me? I am not even 30, I eat right, play sports, and go to the gym everyday! How? Why?"" I rushed myself to the emergency room, the first time I had ever been to emergency room in my life. After a night of care and evaluation, I left the hospital with more questions than answers along with a 30 day holter monitor. Fast forward to a month later and I am sitting in the cardiologist's office while he is explaining he doesn't have an idea why this is happening to me. He then recommends I see an electrophysiologist that day. Soon after I meet with that doctor, I am dazing in and out of reality as he explains that I need to have heart surgery for electrical issues in my heart. Within two weeks the surgery is scheduled and performed. I wake up after the surgery in great pain and still questing why this has happened to me. Even now, a couple of months later I still do not know why or what caused this issue but the result of the whole situation has caused me to shine a new and different type of light on my life and to appreciate every waking moment I get from here on out.",,3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CHJMHTX,0.0

We were really excited to go and get away from the city for a while! We loaded up our tent and supplies into my little car and set out for the ocean! We got to our campsite  on the beach after dark. It was pretty funny watching us try to set up our tent in the pitch black! We finally got our bonfire started and roasted hot dogs over the fire for dinner. When we woke the next morning, my friend John asked if we wanted to go splunking. I hated to admit it but I had no idea what he was talking about! Luckily, he started explaining that it's cave exploring before I had to ask. We were all game so we hopped in the car with our flashlights and took off for the nearby caves. When we entered the cave I was really having second thoughts...what if we get lost in here? it was dark, damp and I kept feeling like I was being watched!! One by one my friends in front of me squeezed through a narrow hole to go deeper into the cave. When it was my turn, I got the top part of my body through just fine but my hips were too large and I literally got stuck!!! I started to panic! The more I twisted and squirmed to get loose the more I got stuck!!! My friends were laughing at first, but after about 30 minutes they soon realized I was literally stuck!  My friend Sarah had some coconut oil sunscreen with her and spread it in any crack she could find around my hips. after that one good tug and I popped right out of there!! I think it's safe to say splunking is not what I though it would be, and I doubt I will ever do it again after that!!!",,3AAPLD8UCD3R9HYSZNUKRU0CHK8HTL,0.0

I haven't been able to sleep since. My father was a very healthy man. He did things like eat healthy, exercise weekly, and went for regular routine check ups with his doctor. If I told me before he died that he wouldn't die of ""old age"" I wouldn't have believed you. My father was kind, caring, and very instrumental to my upbringing. I know that tomorrow is never promised to any of us and at any moment a ""freak accident"" could happen and just like that any of us could be gone. Up until now because it personally never happened to me I didn't really believe it could happen to me. My father was on a run around his surrounding neighborhood like he normally does every week. Unfortunately what my father didn't know was that on this particular day there was a robbery that took place in one of the boarding neighborhoods that he runs through. My father vaguely fit the description of the man who robbed the neighbor so police mistook my father for the robber. The police apparently gave my father instructions to stop running and show his hand but my father had a hoodie on and under the hoodie he had in headphones so he did not hear the polices orders. He eventually saw one of the neighbors motioning towards him to turn around so my father did. My father had his cell phone in his hand and the police claimed they thought it was a gun so they shot my father and he died at the scene. Eventually the police realized they had the wrong man but the damage was already done. Now I fear the police and even going outside my home. The police department has apologized but their apology will not bring back my father. I'm filled with emptiness, anger, and hurt so I lay awake every night since then because when I sleep I relive that day over again.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5WVNPR,0.0

I sat down next to him, and he told me his name was Casey. I asked Casey about his poetry (as I'm also a poet), if he was doing okay, if he had somewhere to sleep that night and if he knew where the shelters were in our area; he told me he did and that he had been to them before. After eating together, exchanging phone numbers, and talking for awhile, I asked him if he had somewhere to sleep that night, and he told me he would probably sleep somewhere on the sidewalk or at a bus stop like last night.  Following an impulse, I  told him he didn't have to sleep on the street, he could crash on my couch tonight if he wanted; if he wanted some AC, a phone charger outlet, a TV with Netflix, the chance to do some laundry, or a shower, he was more than welcome to crash for the night if he wanted to. He seemed surprised and hesitant, saying that offer seemed too good to be true. I know it was not a smart decision by me, but it just felt right. Casey came over, then we ended up drinking a few beers together and talking about life. He said he still had dreams and he was thankful he had it better than so many people. He told me how he went to VCU, how he wanted to start a business, and how he knew this period would be an important part of his story. He said he was thankful for time and the friendliness of people in the city; he said that he didn't resent people who don't help him, they just didn't have time, and he was thankful for everyone who does and that he is beyond fortunate and wants to be able to give back to society and that's why he writes. It touched me on a deeper than spiritual level and I think I will remember his honesty, hope, and gratitude for the rest of my life- it felt like I was talking to a modern-day prophet or Jesus himself, and I was shocked and humbled listening to his story. We then hung out on the couch eating tortilla chips with queso and watching the new season of the 100 on Netflix, a show we both love. The next morning Casey took a shower, washed his clothes, then we parted ways warmly as I thanked him for sharing that time with me. I told him he was a gift, and he had honored and inspired me. My decision to let a homeless stranger sleep in my home was an absolutely reckless one (basically a recipe for getting murdered), and I knew this (I'm extremely fortunate and lucky, and I recognize this decision should not become a habit). However, I was forever changed by what happened. It stretched my empathy, let me connect with someone different from me, and gave me the feeling of traveling without leaving my home. Becoming friends with Casey made me start to view homeless citizens more like people and not just as ""the homeless"". This experience utterly transformed me, and taught me how much I have to learn from the less fortunate, and how much more open to those lessons I should be.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5V3PNZ,0.0

The energy from my mother,father,our dog,--it was such a comforting feeling. Then when I was 14,my mother died. I'd walk into the house and I'd still feel that energy feeling,that feeling of energy ,warmth,and love. It was much reduced but with my father and our dog, it was still there. And then when I was 24,  the dog died. The energy that I had felt in that house,the feeling of love and warmth that had comforted me for so long, was greatly reduced. It  felt like it was almost gone,a shadow of what it once was. And then 4 months ago,I walked into the house to visit my father. I walked in ....and I felt nothing. No energy,no warmth,no love feeling. It felt like I had walked into someone else's house. I actually stepped right back outside after I walked in and looked at the address numbers to make sure I had the right house. That's how strange it felt. I walked through the house. I looked in my old room and felt nothing. The dining room,living room ,rec room,scene of a thousand adventures , and  I felt nothing, only a cold, icy stillness. I looked into my father's bedroom. I felt nothing. I saw that he  was in bed asleep so I didn't disturb him. It was only later when I thought  back about it  did it dawn on me how silent and still my father's room had been. My  father had a heart attack and died in bed,perhaps an hour before I arrived. Everyone who had made that house a home had died. The energy ,love warmth,everything  was gone. It was just an empty house.  I sold it as quickly as I could. There was nothing left for me there. I could not stand to be in the house again remembering what it once was- a home filled with love.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB2CGPN7,0.0

This event in my life was particularly significant as I never once thought I would be in a graduate program. I'm someone who hated school throughout my K-12 years as well as my undergraduate degree. I always struggled to focus and be motivated to achieve good grades. Going to graduate school was a last minute decision for me, because I felt inspired by a mentor I acquired during my undergraduate program to pursue work in Higher Education. This mentor made a huge impact on my life, and they truly are the reason I was able to get through an undergraduate program. I kept in contact with my mentor throughout my graduate program. I let them know about the great times and the terrible ones. I still struggled throughout graduate school to stay motivated, but I felt significant that I was finally studying something that felt relevant to me. Coming up on graduation, my mentor apologized and let me know that they would be unable to attend my graduation. I understood as it was across the country and it would have been difficult to expect their attendance. However, graduation this year was impactful for me as my mentor surprised me at my ceremony, and handed me my diploma. They were not a faculty member of the program, but they were able to work out a deal in which they could be one of the first to congratulate me on my accomplishments. This was so heartwarming that they made the effort to surprise me, and go the extra mile in ensuring I knew they were there for me. They were always there for me.",,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z9UUO6G,0.0

I am very competitive person and at times hate to lose. Due to the fact these are new team member I felt like the leader of the group and did the most trying to play hard as well as get the win.

He got married to his now wife. I had known her for many years, as we went to high school together. It was no surprise that they would get married, as they had been dating and living together for years. The wedding took place a few hours east of where I live, in a beautiful setting with forests and a river. They rented out an entire lodge and a dozen cabins for everyone to stay in. It was a lot of fun. I arrived the day before the wedding. We went on a fun rafting trip that day. Afterwards, we returned to the venue and I helped set things up. The most memorable part of the event was the actual ceremony. It was set up outside with seating near a small lake. It was very lovely. I was up at the front since I was best man. I really enjoyed it. Afterwards, there was a reception and celebration with live music. People danced, ate food and had beer and wine to drink.

I have had it mind to proceed to attain a Masters in Petroleum Geology before hunting for jobs. I have always wanted to work with Exxon Mobil after I had a project assigned to my department in my third year of which I was a part of. I had Mturk and Web development as my main hustle pending the time I get enough money to go for my Masters. Exxon Mobil had an opening some 8 months ago. I applied just like everyone even though my plan was to get a job after my masters. During the application process, I was asked to write a motivation letter. It was through the writing that I changed my mind that I didn't even have to wait to have a Master's degree before I land my dream job. I wrote the letter to the best of my ability highlighting how I want to change the world by working for Exxon Mobil. Luckily for me, I was invited for the next stage of the interview process; an aptitude test. I aced that easily as it was something I loved practicing on when I am less busy. About 2 weeks later, I was invited for a further interview. At this stage, it was getting serious and I really didn't want to lose this one. I put in my very best in the oral and technical session of the interview. It came in like a bomb when 4 months ago, I heard a ping on my laptop. It was a mail!!! I checked it and boom, it was from Exxon Mobil. They invited me for a negotiation. That same week, I was handed my appointment letter and I was given some huge sum of money even before I started work with them. I relocated as my work location is not in my state.  It was a dream come true and the memories will remain evergreen.",,3AQF3RZ55941TNWA8KYRDZWL6AOF6T,0.0

I eventually I decided on Mt. Ouray because it's one of the less difficult mountains to climb in Colorado and I felt it was suitable for a solo-hike. It took a bit of preparation and the climb was still fairly difficult. But it was an incredible experience and one that I'll remember for a long time. I got up around 5AM and started my climb. It took me around 4 hours to summit and I spent around 45 minutes at the top, taking pictures, listening to music and taking in the view. I really enjoyed being able to see for so far. I was grateful that I was able to enjoy such a special experience. I met a couple of other hikers on my route up and down. People are very nice in the mountains, I enjoy chatting with other hikers in my journeys. It was very enjoyable overall and I hope to train some more and be able to hike more mountains next summer. It's a difficult undertaking and there's an element of danger to it, especially hiking alone. But it's something I take seriously and wouldn't give up. It drives me to make myself better and it helps me appreciate the world I live in.",3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28R6CIZD,,0.0

Old faithful did not disappoint.  It was awesome.  During the nights at camp, you could hear some of the newly re-introduced wolves off in the distance.  Some of the group was nervous that they would visit during the night.  I was more concerned with the black bear and most especially the grizzlies.  Both are notorious for letting their noses get them in trouble.  They can smell the food and stick their heads right into tents!  We were sure to put our food in the bear-proof containers provided at the campsite.  But we actually saw some grizzlies visiting the stream when we were fishing.  The salmon were running and the grizzlies rely on these fish to fatten up in order to survive the on-coming winter.  There were several females with cubs who were stationed along the waterfall, catching the salmon that were jumping.  They would pull off some of the skin and nudge it towards the cubs.  They seemed to waste a lot of the fish as they were eating the eggs, the skin and the heads.  I guess they were more interested in the high-calorie parts, which makes sense, considering that they are trying to fatten up.  One bear got too close as one of us was reeling in a fish and the bear decided it was her's.  But the biggest thrill/scare came when a male arrived on the scene.  He seemed to be twice the size of the rest and was a bit of a bully.  But if he got too close to any of the cubs, the brave mom's would confront the massive bear.  I wouldn't want any of those things sticking their heads into my tent in the middle of the night!",,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXX11230R,0.0

I have decided to through a birthday party for myself and my kids today.  They're birthdays are close to mine, so I figured we could all share the party this year, since no one was celebrating a milestone birthday.  I rented a lodge, and prepared decorations in the theme of Twin Peaks, as it's an important show in our family.  My children who are now 4 and 6 even request to listen to songs from the soundtrack during car rides.  I pride myself on throwing them very unique parties that other children would not have.  I bought doughnuts from the best place in town and and spent an entire day actually decorating the lodge.  I spent a month planning the proper decor and spent plenty of money on them.  All of this effort and at the last minute, my in-laws, who where half the guest list started calling that morning and giving reasons as to why they can't come.  All of them boiled down to that they just didn't feel like driving to our town.  My husband and I live an hour and a half from our home town.  I was so upset.  Here I was putting in all this effort into something that half the people on the list, who were family, couldn't even be bother to show up.  We made the best of it, our few friends in town came, and my parents and brother.  All in all it was a good little party and the kids never knew any different.  However, I was furious, and brokenhearted that family could so easily brush them off.  Anytime cousins on that side of the family have parties we are expected to haul our children over for the hour and a half drive, and I never even thought twice about it.  It was important to be with family.  Now I see where we stand and will not be putting myself out for people who have now repeatedly shown me we're not worth one trip, once a year.",3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXK1A03F,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXXK1A03F,0.0

I think everyone was happy to see me.  My first stop once back in my hometown, was my grandma's house.  She is the highlight of my visit every time I am home.

My oldest child's birthday generally falls near that date and we often have out of town family, mine and my husband's parents, down for her party. This year, my child's birthday fell mid-week and I decided that I'd like to have the party the weekend after Mother's Day so that I could enjoy a Mother's Day with just my small family. I booked a Mother's Day tea party for my daughter and me to attend on Saturday then on Sunday we'd all spend the day together. The tea party was lovely and I was glad of my choice. Sunday came and my children, husband and I left home early for a family outing. On our way, I decided to send a Happy Mother's Day greeting to friends in my cell, my MIL and my own mom included. A short time later, I received a voice memo from my mother, crying, telling me that she hopes my children never treat me as I do her. I was dumbfounded. I called to see what was wrong and my mother gave me a laundry list of reasons that she was upset with me, some dating back to my wedding 7 years ago. Historically, I'm apologetic and sheepish with my mother but this time I was firm and set boundaries with her as to what I will not accept when it comes to my choices and my family. I couldn't believe that I stood up to her but it was certainly time. I feel like this, while difficult, will help us have a more genuine relationship moving forward. It is important to me to be valued as an equal. I have a choice when it comes to what I will and will not allow, no matter who the other person is.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE2XSPGS,0.0

My only wish was to be happy at when I get there and have a memorable birthday,when I got to the airport I took an uber to take me to the house. Soon I arrived home, I looked around with no idea of where every one was .the front door was open . I didn't like it. I became anxious and worried. I went upstairs and I met my sisters son . she said they all stepped out so we familiarized and I enjoyed her company because she was very funny. I felt like an her playmate for years. I sat down and closed my eyes. I remembered my old school, my old friends, my teachers and we all played when I was much younger like her. Suddenly my sister her mom walked up to me and screamed happy birthday and at that moment every one came out of their hiding position and I was shocked because I never expected such surprise. It was the best birthday ever and I wish to have such birthday again soonest.

November 2015It was my first year of college and i had just left from a midterm and i was heading over to my boyfriends house to go grab food together. At the time i drove a small mitsubishi eclipse. As i drove i took a detour and drove through a neighborhood due to traffic issues. So anyway, as i drove down the street, the street got more and more narrow. Vehicles were parked on the curb on both sides facing the wrong direction. Anyway, i was driving down, and out of nowhere i see a child run out in front of my vehicle. Of course, this became the worst experience of my life. It all happened too quick and of course as soon as i saw him i stopped the vehicle, but it was too late and the eight year old child hit the front corner of my car. When i got off he was screaming in pain and of course i called 911 as soon as and so did neighbors that had seen what happened. The ambulance and police were there in no time and got the child to safety. While all this happened they took my licence and information and witness statements. The little boy i happened to hit also had four siblings and the police went to talk to them to warm them to not run out in front of the street like that. And although the accident was not preventable and not my fault, it was still a horrible feeling. I definitely don't recommend.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950S0MB6A,0.0

I was also very happy to hear my friend's voice. He said they they are planning for a class reunion and it is in the month of June. He was very specific that I should not miss this chance as I can see all my schoolmates. I went to work that day and during the break I called the travel agent to book me a ticket for June 5th as the class reunion was on June 7th. I planned to spend two weeks at my home country and return on 20th June. Everything went as planned I reached India and met my parents and on June 7th I reached the venue where the class reunion was planned. It was a great moment to see all my classmates. They came with their family and it was great fun to see all the tiny tots. My ex girl friend also came. She was all by herself. I went and spoke to her. She opened up and it was a great shock to me to hear that recently her family met with an accident and she lost her hubby and her kid. I had to give her lot of courage. It was an eye opener to me as I realized that man proposes and God disposes. It is the same lady who ditched me many years ago as she found someone more handsome and wealthier than me.  I really felt sorry after I heard her story. It was a bitter sweet feeling to say goodbye to my classmates that night.,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950J5BB60,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950J5BB60,0.0

We had planned this week long vacation for several months in advance. It had been arranged so that we could visit relatives who live in the area. The morning we were to leave for our trip was very sunny so I woke up a few hours early from the light shining through my window. So, I used this extra time to finish packing my belongings that I had forgotten to pack the night before. We left around 9:30 on a warm, July Monday morning. It was a long trip and when we finally got there we were exhausted. So we decided to just rest and start out early the following morning. After that we went to Ride Niagara, a simulated ride over the Niagara Falls. It was rather realistic considering we never moved from a set position. After the ride, we met a French Canadian, who had a heavy accent and lived in Quebec. He helped us decide what attractions were worthwhile. After visiting a few of them we returned to the hotel worn out. On that Wednesday we rode on the Maid Of The Mist. When the boat reached close to the bottom of the falls everyone could feel the power of the falls by the incredible mist and loud roar of the falls. Later that day we went on a journey behind the falls, which took us through tunnels that actually opened up behind the falls. The lines for both these activities were very long so this took up most of the day. We spent another day visiting tourist attractions in that area. Then we decided to spend the rest of our time visiting our relatives. We saw many of our family members we haven? t seen in years. It was sad that we had to leave that Sunday, but we did. So we left for a long ride home with only the memories of our vacation.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D,,0.0

I wasn't sure how the event was going to unfold. I was worried I would miss out on something by not picking out the perfect seat.  It was a great night. I worried about everything for nothing because it turned out great. I felt relief more than happiness. I felt calm afterwards. I felt like I stressed to much.",3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY2GDLYE,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY2GDLYE,0.0

It was after some heavy rain the the river was up a bit more than normal. After lazing down the river for a good bit. I hit a hard dog leg with some people who were stuck in a raft at the bend. I couldn't really help them so I went to pass em but the current swept we away. I hit a tree branch and turned over. The people in the raft saved my life bu pulling me out of the water. Afterwards they helped me back in my kayak and I went back down the rest of the river and caught up with my family who had no idea what happened to me. They talked to me a bit about what happened but it was already over with and I was safe. That's all that mattered. It impacted me hard that I almost lost my life that day. I thanked the group heavily after I seen them later on. It was a fun rest of the trip. I'll never forget what happened that day. That day changed my life.,,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LY1MJLYV,0.0

As much as my in-laws wanted a big wedding I'm so happy Nick and I had a small 50 person wedding on the coast. It's hard to believe it has been 3 months already. I don't believe anything can be perfect, but our wedding was so special and was so us. All of our closest friends and family were there and we decided to have a causal wedding on the beach. We rented 4 huge beach houses that everyone could stay in and has a small, short but sweet ceremony on the water followed by a reception in the background of one of the rentals. We had the food catered and everyone was able to drink and dance the night away. It was special to spend it with the people who knew us the most and were closest to us. It was the best day and I look back on that day with such fond memories. The sun was shining and the weather was warm, but had a great breeze. Nick and I had so many special moments shared together with the ones we loved.  Our mom had the best time celebrating us and they could not stop smiling that day. I remember the dance with my dad and how he told me how special I was and how proud he was of me and that I picked the right man. He want so happy that I was happy. My brother and his wife were there. My niece who is only 2 was there. I can't wait to celebrate a year!",,3BC8WZX3V4IRIWZ3R31J5J10G4VRRT,0.0

He loved the band ever since he first discovered them in the 1980's. However, due to me being born, family responsibilities and our financial situation, he was never able to buy tickets to go see them when they were on tour in America. He always worked and saved and gave everything to me an my mom. We never wanted for anything because of him and his sacrifices. But we always knew his longing to go see his favorite band. He wore an old beat up Metallica T-shirt everyday at home and played their music almost every Saturday on his day off or in the car. So, when I turned 18, me and my mom decided to plan a trip for him to go see Metallica during their US tour this year during his birthday weekend. We saved up so that he could go to a hotel and truly enjoy the weekend during the festival. During that time, mom got sick and we put our plans on hold. She passed away not too long after, just 2 months before the day of the trip. Me and my dad were devastated. Mom was our joy and losing her made us very depressed. One day, after looking through her things, I found the concert tickets that we had bought to go see Metallica with dad on his birthday. I showed dad the tickets and he broke down crying in bittersweet tears. We both went to the concert and loved it, and enjoyed it in my mom's memory. She was there with us singing along.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYDZILYW,0.0

Every doctor gave me a different story. Well, I say 'every' but I know I've only been to two others, I guess I just started to feel like I wasn't getting anywhere. you go see a doctor and then get a prescription, take medications, give it a try and hope things work out. There's no guarantees. And honestly, it just started to feel like it was about being boxed into any kind of box that allowed them prescribed medication they were enticed to sell. Anyway, meeting her was awesome, immediately we got down to the facts, I have these headaches. They come and are debilitating, but migraine medication doesn't work. It starts out in my neck, goes into my head and just sits there for days on end. She asked about how I spent my days, how I spend a lot of time working at the computer. She asked about my eyes, wearing glasses, all of that. She just seemed to know exactly how to get where she was going. And I even admitted to her how I just didn't believe anything would work out. She pulled up some information on the computer and explained how my headaches were probably related to my eyes. And that back pain was causing neck pain and so on. I couldn't believe what she knew about this given she was a general practitioner not a specialist. Just like that, she said it wasn't migraines and previous treatments were all wrong, and missteps for my treatment. So fast forward a couple weeks, a visit to the optometrist and now I haven't had a headache or stuffy head or pain in my neck since these visits. I am so thrilled and happy. I called her office to say thanks and they took time to talk to me and see how I was doing. Just a great experience all in all. So yeah, I am thrilled.",,3BDCF01OGYGPCZGC0EWHR3LYT5PLYV,0.0

I haven't talked to her in over 5 years now.  I was so excited to finally tell her that we had a baby boy and that she was a grandma.  She sounded so happy for us.  We got to talking about what has happened these past five years.  I told her about getting married and my wife getting pregnant.  How we moved to a different state and how we had our first son.  She had been embarrassed to return my many calls.  She had quit drinking 10 years ago but she hit some hard times and started up again.  It got so bad for her that she had to go to rehab to quit.  I had a bit of a rocky upbringing because of her problems and she didn't want to burden me with them again.  I guess I won't be able to trust her alone with my kids anytime soon because she obviously cannot control her problems.  I still plan on being there for her and doing whatever I can to help her get better again.  I guess she probably doesn't know that dad died either, she hadn't talked to him in a very long time.

My mom is the strongest woman that I know and I admire her, she went through a lot of tough events that completely broke her and five years ago, she decided to move to France to try to find peace and to start a new and improved life. My mom has suffered from depression, anxiety and bipolar disorder for the longest time. I was happy for her when she decided to make a change to her life finally. But it didn't turn out very well as my father went to check on her once by surprise right after she had moved. It turns out that she was going through a deeper depression and nothing seemed to make her feel better. She did not want to see anyone and did not want to talk to anyone. So I have been trying to call her for five years almost every single day, but she never picked up... until last June.. I called her and she actually picked up. It was one of the best moments of my life. We talked for about five hours and I finally got to tell her something that I knew would make her the happiest. Me and my wife just had our first child together which means that my mom is now a grandma and when I broke the news, she couldn't stop crying, but I knew that this time, it was tears of joy. She was so excited as she had been asking me for so long to give her a grandkid. We got to catch up on different things, positive and not so positive ones but what matter is that I got to have her back in my life and I got to share the great news. I am so grateful for that day, that it finally did happen and that I don't have to feel like there is a huge part of my life missing. I will make sure that I keep on calling her everyday and hopefully soon she will come visit us and finally meet my son. I really feel like this year is the year where I finally feel like my life is complete.",3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7LX4M9,3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7LX4M9,0.0

Indeed, she has been suffering from severe depression and bipolar disorder for as long as I could remember. This makes it very hard for her to be reliable and dependable and it makes it even harder to keep a close relationship with her. I was trying so hard for 5 years to get a hold of her. I tried almost everyday. Her phone would ring but she would just let it ring and sometimes she would get so tired of me that she would just turn it off and it would just go directly to voicemail. I was going to give up but June 1st was her birthday and I had something important to tell her. I had to announce that my wife and I were expecting a child and that she was going to become a grandmother. Luckily, she answered, which was a miracle to me. She was ecstatic and could not believe it. I was so happy because I knew that it was something that she had always hoped for. She sounded a little bit upset though and I think that it is because she is so far away and it will be so hard for her to see her grandson. I thought that telling her the good news would make her happy and make her keep in touch with me. Unfortunately, as unpredictable as she is, I should have known better.

I spent my first weekend away since giving birth to my son and I really needed it. He is 18 months and was with my boyfriend, his father the whole weekend. When I came back Sunday afternoon, I saw that my son's toe was really red. I was worried about it and he kept pointing to it, even though he could not talk, I could tell it was bothering him. We called the doctor on the video call to try and see if they would give us some advice and ultimately we had to go into urgent care. We only had 20 minutes before the urgent care would stop taking patients so by that time I rushed over and got him checked in. I was so worried it would be something bad. Since it was his big toe, worst case scenario, he would lose it and never be able to walk right again. Turns out it was just cellulitis which is an infection but nothing severe. We were given antibiotics for my little man and went on our way. A few days later our son wakes up from his nap with a hot of red bumps and spots all over his body. We rush to the doctor because we are so worried about what it might be, bug bites, measels, etc. But we find out it was just a delayed reaction to the antibiotics. I am personally allergic to penicillin and turns out my son was allergic as well and I didn't realize amoxicillin was a type of penicillin. We stopped the antibiotics because he was all better anyway and gave him an antihistimine and now he is 100% better now",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY70Y6H0Y,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY70Y6H0Y,0.0

One year back, I had changed jobs and joined a new construction company as procurement engineer. Compared to my previous job, this job was more demanding and challenging. I weathered the phase more or so competently. Many a times, I had my doubts whether I had taken the right decision. The challenges were difficult mainly because we did not have a direct procurement manager. The Quality Assessment and Quality Control manager was also acting as Procurement Manager. So his time with the department was limited. So I found tough to take his opinion in several important issues which lead to lot of delays, and sometimes I had to take risky decision. Two months back, this particular manager resigned and the new QAQC manager did not want to take procurement responsibilities also. Since our company was going through a financial crisis, they could not afford to recruit another procurement manager. So the management decided to make me procurement in charge. I was really shocked to receive such a responsibility. I was not sure if I was up to the task. Last two months have been really challenging. I had to work harder even after my working hours. I put in lot of work even on 2-3 Sundays. But once I got the hang of the situation. I performed outstandingly well and yesterday I got 40% salary hike. I am really glad now. I really understand now that HARD WORK PAYS. I realize that when opportunities knock, you have to grab it with both hands. And unless you try, you never know how you will cope up with new challenges. And never ever give up. And to completely realize your potential, never shy away from challenges.",,3BEFOD78W7FTKAKDBJ9PBRWG7Q94MV,0.0

I went with my mom, who had just finished up a year of chemo. She'd visited just the previous year, before getting sick. It was very strange for me seeing relatives after such a long time. Some I had never met, they were kids. It was very stressful dealing with my mom and my grandma at once. They're difficult personalities. I liked getting back in touch with cousins for the most part. One seemed to be avoiding us for some reason and I don't think it was ever sorted out. I'd been caring for my mom alone for the previous year and it took everything out of me. As a result the visit was paid for by relatives which I appreciated. But I really didn't think it made up for them leaving me hanging all that time. They've always been very well off and work in the medical field to boot. I haven't really had any contact with them since. 6 months later I'm still caring for my mom alone.",3BGYGHDBBY6TAS1XXN7H33LKART220,,0.0

That was, until I met Jessica about 2 years ago at a rock climbing gym. We really hit it off right away and it was like love at first sight. My life really changed for the better as I got to know her more and we became like partners in an adventure. A few months ago we decided to finally get married. We were trying to figure out what type of ceremony would be appropriate for the two of us. After some brief discussion, we realized that it wouldn't make sense to have a fancy ceremony since we were pretty simple people. Instead, we decided on a small, lighthearted ceremony that tried to emphasize the fun that we've had in our relationship. The actual wedding day was two weeks ago, and it was such a blast. We hired a few joke writers who made speeches that poked fun at various guests attending the ceremony, as well as myself and Jessica. It went better than expected, and their routines were really classy, but still amazingly funny at the time. We also made fools of ourselves by trying to dance even though we're both pretty clumsy. It was OK though, because it got a lot of laughs out of the attendees, which is the most important part. I will always cherish the memories that I have of that day. That day really symbolizes what kind of people Jessica and I are, and what type of relationship we hope to keep until death due us part.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7K670HI,0.0

It wasn't because I didn't want to see them, just the times didn't match up. It's hard for me to set up plans because as someone with anxiety, it's a lot of information that is thrown at me at once. My family also isn't the easiest to get along with, so that was a wrench also when it came to setting things up. But now, I had time. I met them where they lived at. It took a while to get passed the initial awkwardness, and to be honest I still felt that for a while. My mind kept telling me to run and to fight another day. But I was determined to see it through. Lots of different emotions were had; joy, sadness, amusement, fun, anger, calm, and anything in between. There were significant stressors, although that doesn't mean it was all bad. Some of the topics were quite good and healthy, and I'll argue that even the touchy subjects made some headway. Overall, I really don't regret the experience. In fact, I look forward to more interactions. We just have to line up on time again.",,3BGYGHDBBY6TAS1XXN7H33LKART220,0.0

After the recommendation i consulted a different doctor as i was not comfortable to do another surgery. But both the doctors recommended to have the surgery. It was surprising that both the doctors recommending the surgery without trying a different method. I underwent the second surgery exactly after 2 months of my first knee surgery. Now i have gained more weight. even though i do not have the knee pain right now but i am very sure it has given me some lingering symptoms. restless sleep from gaining weight, and pain all over the body if i workout. I am consulting a psychiatrist regarding the restless sleep. The psychiatrist doctor is recommending sleeping pills but i am not willing take pills as it will be a addiction on later stage of life.

We drove up to the children's hospital and checked in at 7am - thank goodness our appointment was in the morning, otherwise I don't know how we would have kept her happy without eating! She wasn't even awake enough to realize she hadn't eaten since the night before. And by the time we got to the hospital, well there were things to see so that kept her distracted enough. We met up with the surgeon and went in the operating waiting room which is where things got iffy. First, Gabby realized this was a doctor's office, and she didn't like that. Doctors = shots. Then, they put her in the operating robe, which was cold. And then, she got bored with the few rattles and toys we brought. Eventually they took her for surgery and that's when she (and I!) broke down. She started screaming hysterically, and I couldn't stop myself from sobbing. She's just so tiny. Like, I know she in the 95th percentile for height within other one-year-olds but still that's tiny. Brandon took good care of me and we waited it out in the coffee shop. We eventually got a phone call that she was coming out. She made it out fine, but she was really miserable, and snuggled up with us in front of Teletubbies for the next 5+ hours? She's alright, that's all that matters. Glad we got that cyst out of her and glad we found out about it before it cause issues, but still intestine surgery is pretty major surgery for a toddler.",,3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY7K6E0HP,0.0

Thankfully, it has made our world, and her world, change for the better. I was skeptical about depression medication. However, I am glad I gave it a chance. Today, our daughter is living a happy life along with the rest of her family.",,3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAHUA65,0.0

It was the first event we held in our home since moving in, a month prior to the party. It was a big deal, because we were about to move in last fall before Hurricane Florence hit, flooding our newly built home. We had almost 4 feet of water in our home. It was a party, and just a celebration as well, to finally complete the home (again). We had not even gotten 100% settled before the party, but it was just so nice being ""home."" We had it catered, and did a lego theme for my son. He enjoyed opening all of his presents. He and his buddies played and played. We had cupcakes, but the dog ended up getting into them, ruining half of them. We also did a piñata, and the kids enjoyed hitting it. He got a lot of new lego sets. He also got a camouflage table set and new race cars. We all had a blast.",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA535MU7,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA535MU7,0.0

We also went to get something to eat while we waited. After about two hours we were able to go to our rooms where we changed, unpacked, and rested before other festivities began. The first day was quite a few activities and we went to the big sail away party. It seemed like everyone onboard was there. It was kinda hot but it was still fun. We had drinks out on the deck, listened to the music, and even danced. There were people of all ages there so it was definitely family friendly. After the party, we continued to sit out on the deck enjoying the scenery as the ship sailed out to sea. Next, was the welcoming show that was given by our cruise director.

About eight months ago we had gotten together and in a family meeting. Things were said and emotions were shared. We discussed all things that mattered to us and got anything off our chests. Feeling were hurt and it got a bit sticky. Ultimately we all wanted a fresh start and agreed to spend some more time together. About 4 1/2 months ago we were planning to get together. We made plans for a day a month or so in advance. When the time got closer there it was brought to my attention that it was not only siblings, but our significant others. Which I prefer, but I did not have a reliable sitter that could spend the entire day with my kids. I told my oldest brother that we would have to alter the plans or not attend. He became upset and really tried to persuade me to go with the original plan. He wanted to meet up and then we could go home and the rest of them would go to dinner in town like he wanted. My sister agreed that was not a good idea. We tried to come up with some other plans, but they were never booked and then the reservations where unavailable. I gave up and decided it wasn't worth my energy and would just go along with what I could and for when we had the sitter available. A few days before the planned day, it was decided that we couldn't come to a decision and that we should just postpone. In typical fashion, we never got together. We got busy with life and the holidays. We got together for the holidays but not just to be social. I would have preferred better communication and just all of us to get together with kids and spouses, ,but things tend to be more difficult when it comes to family.",3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHOQA7EU,,0.0

I am particularly enthusiastic about bonuses. 2 months ago, I left school as usual and showed myself on the Uber app to be online. My first passenger was just nearby and the fare was a $45.

I had a strange feeling about going out that day but I ignored this feeling, after all, I am stronger than I look. I dashed for the dash. I was going at 46 mph when I saw the traffic light turn yellow. I thought, it is still safe to cross, after all, it means ""cross if you are unable to halt"". I dashed through. I didn't see a truck coming from my left. We collided at the junction and my bumper and dashboard was destroyed beyond recognition.

I had never been on a cruise before so from the time I got to the port I was in complete amazement. Once we were on the ship and did the safety class my family and I went to explore all that we could do on the ship. A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars.

I only got a bruise but had a fun time. I then went to the movies. I saw a blockbuster. It was surprisingly not a remake. It had a great plot with great action scenes.

I already knew it would be, but Frank pushed me to have another walk through to make sure everything we needed for our guests would be there. I still had no doubts that this was the perfect location! We were getting ready to leave and Frank asked about the restrooms and where they were located. The guide showed us the bathrooms and me and Frank looked at each other. This wasn't enough for our guests! I asked if there was anymore bathrooms and the guide said ""Not for public access."" It wasn't enough for us! So we asked to see the living quarters one more time. This was where we'd be getting ready for the wedding. We found some bathrooms there that lead out to the main courtyard and Frank asked if guests could use those.

It was held at a social organization's building both inside and outside.  I imagine that about 100 people were there.  Tons of food and drinks, lots of games to play.  After the sun went down and most of the family had left, a small group of us went over to my great aunt's house where my uncle played his guitar and we all stomped our feet, clapped our hands.  That is probably my most vivid memory.  That was in 1986. Well, fast forward to 2019 and my attempts at reviving the Davis family reunion.  Obviously, many of those who attended 33 years ago have since passed away.  And you would think that with today's technology, like Facebook, it would be easy to track down long lost relatives.  Nope!  I was having to glean information from immediate relatives for phone numbers and looking at old photographs and determining who people were, how they were related to one another.  We had the reunion back in August, but I had started the process back in February, basically trying to get the word out.  A lot of prep work went into putting it together, getting a hall rented (thank you American Legion!), buying food and drinks, borrowing tables, chairs, a canopy, cornhole boards.  We even brought our own gas grill.  We had so much stuff to bring to the reunion that I had to rent a 15 foot Uhaul!  We had approximately 35 people attend.  I was hoping for a few more to show up, but all in all I was satisfied with how things turned out.  Some of my cousins want to do it every year, but others have said that every other year would be better.  So I have already began mental preparations for the 2021 Davis Family Reunion!",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA8MIMUP,,0.0

All that work finally paid off and I was ready to take the next step in my life. I was worried about how I looked and knew at some point everyone would be looking at me. I bought new shoes since that's the only thing that shows under my graduation robe. They were nice plain black shoes and I got a good deal on them. Lucky for me they were also comfortable, because we stood around for nearly two hours before the ceremony began. The longer it took, the more nervous I got. I wish we could just get it over with. When my diploma was finally in my hands I was so proud of myself I could barely stand still. My family was very supportive, but I had no idea they were going to throw me a party. It was the best party ever since my grandmother and my Aunt Lois were there. I haven't seen Aunt Lois for a couple years and she's always been my favorite aunt. She remembered roasted chicken was my favorite and insisted that's what we had for dinner. What a nice surprise! Mom really did a lot of work but I could tell she was having a lot of fun. She's proud of me and that makes me feel really good. This was the best party I've ever been to, and it was all for me.

I met someone in my group that I'll go onto marry. We both were horror fans, so we got a lot of answers right -- but most importantly, we met each other. The group we were with was very funny. One of the other groups didn't know anything about horror films or books, but they kept inventing answers anyway, which was hilarious. They were very inventive. We were there for a few hours, but the night went so quickly. We were sad when it ended. So much so that we hung around together just to talk and have a few more drinks. It was a great way to meet new people and blow off steam. We ended up making it a regular habit, and over time grew very close. The drinks were cheap during the game -- happy hour prices. Therefore, we didn't have to worry about the cost! Anyway, spending money on a good time once a week is worth it, especially since it ended up in an engagement. Now we still do it -- I'm looking forward to taking part in a war trivia game next week. Together, we should be able to win again. Oh -- did I mention?

It is not that I don't want to. It is just because they are not receptive to it. I know I cannot shove it down their throats because they will build a wall so quick to block it out. I have to be more subtle about it. When I took my niece shopping a few months back, she brought up something that was from the bible. She was not having a biblical conversation, but she did have to mention a certain custom that was found in the bible. Naturally, she took a worldly view of it rather than read the entire book to understand the context. I was able to explain what the snippet she shared actually meant. She rarely listens when I am able to share something with her like this, but she was the one who brought it up so I did have her attention. It was like only climbing a foot up a 1,000 foot wall as far as progress goes, but this was much better than declining, which is usually what happens. I hope to have more chances in the future, but I know they will be hard to find. I am encouraged though by this. It means that she will be open once again to hear the gospel since she was this time. I just hope that I can get the rest of the family, and her, on board!",3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHRRUDPY,,0.0

My daughter and I were involved in a car accident on a morning that was already not so pleasant. I had barely gotten any sleep the night before because I had been up crying my eyes out. My cousin (who is more like a brother to me) had been involved in a very terrible car accident and was on life support. My emotions were everywhere. I gathered my daughter because I didn't want her to be late going to school. Once I got in my truck, I realized that it would not start. I had to call my mother to borrow her BRAND NEW truck, which she had just purchased two weeks prior. She came to my house and I dropped her off at her house and was making my way to my daughters school. On the four way highway, my daughter and I were in the left lane. The light turned green and I then realized that a car ahead of me was making a left turn and yielding oncoming traffic. I turned on my signal light to get into the right lane since there was no traffic coming behind me. As soon as I switched over and started to move past some of the other cars in the left lane. As I was passing the cars that were in the left lane, one of the cars came over in the right lane hitting me and my daughter. I was knocked off of the road and onto the sidewalk. I had to stay there for a moment because my daughter was yelling and screaming and my nerves were shook. I was able to move the truck from off the sidewalk and park behind the young lady who hit me and police were called. My nerves were so shaken up because I had got into an accident and for one moment my whole life flashed before my eyes, was I about to end up like my cousin?? I was also worried about the fact that I had crashed my mom's new truck which was her first concern when I called her; leaving my child and I as an afterthought. With my daughter in my arms trying to comfort her, I began to cry. Everything was going wrong in my life at this moment, and I had no one. The young lady who hit me had called her older sister there to be with her; meanwhile I had no one. I texted my boyfriend who was at work, but he gets no service in certain places..... everything was a mess. However, the young lady was very nice and offered to pay for all of the damages because she was a new young driver who didn't want to increase her insurance. Her sister saw how upset I was and gave me a hug which turned out to be very comforting. It turns out the sister worked at the local hospital and remembered seeing the ambulance bringing my cousin in the day prior. She sent her love and prayers to my family and my daughter and I went to the hospital to be examined; my daughter was fine, I had minor aches for a few days, and my cousin died three weeks later",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHQPGPDR,0.0

He turned 18 this past April.  In addition, he learned on that day the news we have been waiting all year to hear.  He was notified of admission to his 1st choice college.  We both agreed that this was the best birthday gift he could have received.  We had planned to go out for dinner to celebrate his birthday.  Now we had two very grand reasons to celebrate.  My sister also came to dinner with us so it made it all the more memorable.  I was very nostalgic on this occasion to see my youngest son reach legal age.  Also, he would be departing for college in just a few months.  It was a very joyous occasion.  But I must admit, I was just a little bit melancholy realizing he would be forging his path alone without my watchful eye.  The only blight on this very happy occasion was that my oldest son would not be joining us.  My oldest son is unwell and everyone missed his presence. We decided to go to a steakhouse for dinner.  We spend the evening talking about my son's future plans and goals.  All of the adults offered very sage advice for getting through the first year of college.  My nephew had some pretty good advice for him.  My nephew graduated from the university my son will attend 10 years ago.  I watch my son bask in everyone's praise and admiration for doing so well in high school and for getting into the university of his choice.  We concluded the evening by having cake and ice cream at the steakhouse.  The waiters served the cake with their campy birthday chorus which embarrassed my son.  It was nice to get together with close family for a happy occasion for one.  The last time we were altogether was for a sad occasion.  A close relative had died.",,3C5W7UE9CGCKIC8NVUBU82TES8EMXU,0.0

You hear of some fantastic revelation some day up on the mountain, or a close encounter with nature, even a brush with some insane disaster, bringing the person onto the doorstep of death. Most people quote extraordinary event that is very unique to them and hear about how that something have come to have a great impact on their lives, changing the very manner in which they view life and perceive it. You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQQBUYZ,0.0

Without this man, I would surely be lost in this life. I think that it would be fair to say that he is the glue that holds this family together. I am so glad that way back in 2011, I agreed to be his girlfriend. That was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 2019 was a rather rough year for us though. It tested us in ways that I never thought would be possible. About six months ago, I was laid off from my current job due to ""budget cuts."" The lay off came out of nowhere and I was under the impression that I was secure in my job. I was devastated about it and it sent me into a depression over the following weeks. The depression continues to get worse because I was struggling to find another job. It got so bad, to the point where I wouldn't even get out of bed some days. I was a mess. Nothing was getting done around the house and the clutter was just making me feel worse about the entire situation. My husband quickly noticed. Normally, he is this stone cold guy, who rarely shows affection or his emotion. However, over this course of that week, my husband pulled out all the stops to get me out of my funk. He would come home from work and draw me a bubble bath and immediately begin dinner. There were even a few occasions that week where he would bring home flowers and a nice card for no reason at all. He left me sticky notes with little affirmations about how much he loved me and how amazing I was all over the house. He even did the dishes a few times, the right way. Not once did he make me feel bad about not being able to find a new job after the layoff. I knew he was stressing out about it, but he never let on that he was stressed at all. He was doing anything that he could think of to just make me smile and make me feel like I wasn't worthless. That week, I realized I won the lottery with him. My husband truly and unconditionally loves me.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQQBUYZ,0.0

We needed someone to take a chance on us to be able to find a place to live. We were running out of time, but luckily found a home owner who was willing to work with us. What a relief it was to find a house and it was in a better neighborhood than we were living. At least something good did come out of the situation.

At first I did not like to hear it. Even I thought of going home in the middle. But when the time passed by I liked the theme. At one time I experienced a change in myself.

I've always been an introverted person by nature. Due to my generally unsociable personality, I was skeptical about the extroverted and bombastic vibe of a festival. I wasn't convinced I could click with a large community of strangers given my temperament. I knew however that going to such an event could be what I needed to break out of my shell. I was shocked at the kindness directed towards first-timers and how easy it was to integrate into the community. The general theme of the festival was one of self-regulation - there was no central authority or rules. Thus, there was a general theme of unchecked hedonism, essentially people were left to their own devices and allowed to do whatever they wanted. The only real rule was simply to not attack or detriment the community, which was left to police itself. It reminded me of anarcho-communist, de-centralized conceptual communities, but in this regard I was able to watch those ideas play out in person. The festival was peaceful and a fun time for everyone involved despite the lawless nature of it and it made me optimistic that ideas like these could succeed on a larger scale. I was able to express myself in ways I had never gotten to previously. It stripped me of my gut apprehension towards things like public nudity by it being so ubiquitous that it resulted in desensitization. I also had an apprehension towards hedonic things like public sex and open drug use, but it was so wide-spread that it became a footnote, like background noise. Exposing myself to a culture like that opened my mind and expanded my capabilities for tolerance towards others and behavior that runs contrary to my own day to day experience. Thus, I think the extreme nature of that festival made me a more robust and tolerant person, and less tightly-wound.",,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99J2VI7X,0.0

I took the back roads home so I could enjoy a nice relaxing drive while listening to music. Blasting music and singing along was relaxing. But then all of a sudden I notice something on the side of the road. It looked like it was a deer. So I slowed down the car and slowly started to pass by the deer. But for some reason I pulled over and put my flashers on. I still don't know why I did this because I'm sure it would've scared the deer away but it didn't. Soon after pulling over the deer started walking towards my car and sniffing. I turned the car off and just waited inside. As I waited I watched the deer examine the car and look at me. Soon after checking me out it went back into the woods. I didn't drive away just yet because I had a feeling something was going to happen. Sure enough shortly after the deer went into the woods it came back out and this time it had little fawns with it following. I sat in the car just watching them and one even walked up to the car and licked it. I was just so relaxed and at peace watching the family cross the road. After they walked to the other side of the woods I started my car up and started driving back home. Went I got home I say a stray cat and decided to feed it. I sat on my porch as the stray cat ate. I had a drink of ice tea then after the cat finished eating I took the bowl inside and cleaned it. After that I passed out in bed.,3CFJTT4SXUC47EC5S294MA99J2V7IM,,0.0

My family have been going on this annual trek for the last 20 years.  It is an eagerly anticipated yearly trip.  I rent a large 15 capacity van.  My sister and I both take our families.  I offer to give rides to the more elderly family members.  We usually hit the road around 6AM.  I have completed the pick-up of the other occupants by 9AM.  We head on down the Turnpike for the long drive down.  We always have a goal to try to beat the prior year's time.  It should take around 8-9 hours to get to our hotel.  However, no matter how hard we try, we are usually the last family members from our area to check in.  The difficulty is that there are only 2 drivers.  My sister and I take turns drive around 3 hour stretches.  And inevitably, we just end up stopping incessantly for many rest room breaks.  The hotel is usually all filled with family members and it has an indoor pool.  All of the planned activities is at the hotel so inclement weather will not ruin the events.  It is a 3 day event.  On Friday evening, there is a meet and greet social.  The reunion dinner and memorials is held on Saturday.  This is a formal event.  The dinner iis catered with formal service.  Each year we have a memorial service to honor members that have passed during the year.  Immediately after dinner, we have an awards ceremony for recent college graduates and members who will be entering college.  The highlight of the weekend is the talent show.",,3CN4LGXD5YATER9RUMX05MJNAE44YO,0.0

It was a beautiful wedding. Our venue was on a winery in Napa Valley, California and we had guests come from all over. It honestly felt like a fairy tale. We had twinkle lights set up everywhere and our ceremony overlooked the gorgeous property during sunset. I am going to be honest, my wife did most of the planning. I feel like that is always how it goes. But I said I wanted a live band. We got a bluegrass group to play and everyone really enjoyed dancing to the music. It is funny how most of the planning lands on the woman. The night is really about the bride. I kind of feel I just need to show up and have a good time. She was so worried about what she looked like and I tried to tell her she was beautiful no matter what, but of course she never believes that. She had a great time too though, I just think there was more stress for her leading up to the wedding than for me. All the wine we drank was from the winery we were at and it was great! My wife has great taste and everyone let her know she did a wonderful job- as did I choosing her. I can't believe it has only been a year since the wedding. Time has flown by. We've moved in together, starting creating a home and are talking about having kids. For our honeymoon we went to southern Italy and that was amazing. We went to historical sites for me and beach and wineries for her. It was a wonderful experience. I look back at our wedding fondly.",,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWCUP25A,0.0

I wanted to do something different this year. Its not that I didn't have fun on my birthday's, but it was just getting kind of old, like me. I was hoping my friends would offer to do something this time, and they did. One of them suggested we go to Universal Studios. This was definitely more than I was thinking of. I was hoping we'd just do something close to home, just not at a family members's house. I had never even been out of the state since I was a kid, so this was going to be a big occasion. We booked out flights and went about a week later. I hated the plane ride, but the fun time we had there made up for it. We ate so much overpriced food, went on rides, went sight seeing at areas around the place, and just had a blast. I'm not a fan of Harry Potter, but my friends are, so they suggested we go to the Harry Potter restaurant. Since food was involved, I was down for it. It wasn't great, but I did recognize some of what I saw there, which made it somewhat better. It would have been cooler had I actually been a fan. After a few days there, we all went back home and went on with our lives. I had such a good time.",,3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF78ISPKL,0.0

About seven weeks ago, Henry, started Kindergarten.  It was his first day of elementary school, and since he is my oldest child, it was my first day of Kindergarten as well.  We woke up a little bit early that day to make sure that we had plenty of time to get ready.  When I woke up my son, you could tell that he was excited but nervous about starting school.  We began our morning with a big hug, and then I started helping him get ready.  We had already picked out his clothes the night before, so he got dressed while I made him a special breakfast.  By the time that he was dressed, it was time to eat.  We sat at the kitchen table and ate pancakes together, while his brother and sister were still sleeping in their beds.  After eating, he brushed his teeth and combed his hair, while I got his siblings out of bed and dressed.  At this point, it was time to head outside to wait for the bus.  We all stood at the end of the driveway and stared down the street looking for the big yellow school bus.  Soon we could see it driving down our street.  I looked into my son's eyes, and I could see that he was starting to get nervous again.  We all gave him a big hug, as the school bus pulled up.  He started climbing up the stairs and turned around to look back at us.  I snapped a couple of pictures as he disappeared into the vehicle.

You wouldn't believe it! First, I couldn't decide whether to sell as-is, get it painted and repaired, sell it myself, or get a realtor -- in any combination thereof. So I was running all those possibilites at once! The first obstacle I ran into was that I couldn't find any contractors to do the painting and repair work. I mean, I was ghosted by three contractors who never showed up to give a bid! The economy must be great, right!?I thought about selling as is to one of those ""we buy houses"" people. That guy bullshitted me that the house was virtually unsellable because of size and location, and uninsurable as well. He offered me about half value. No thanks! I was sweating bullets about getting the repairs and painting done. I wanted -- needed -- to get the house ready and leave town quickly. I talked to one friend who was out of work but gone for the holidays about helping me when he got back, for pay. Another friend volunteered to come in from out of state and help for free. Botdh those options meant delay and doing work I really don't like to do. After two weeks of setting up all options -- after all, I didn't know what was going to pain out -- I found a contractor who did the work for a reasonable price in a week. Then a realtor had it under contract in another week. Phew! So stressful! I never want to own another house. As Thoreau said about farms, I'll apply to all real estate: It's more easily aquired than got rid of!",3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWU1K524,,0.0

As an IT personnel, After each work Day I usually located the nearest bar to relax and have a glass of drink. It all began one night, I was up due to a severe pain in my stomach. I took pain killers to ease the pain as I thought pain Killers would make me fine unfortunately the pain kept coming back. At first I thought I knew what was wrong with me. Drinks. I stopped taking all drinks except water. few days later, I started having the same trouble right in my Office. I wanted to come home First . Oh Gush! My stomach hurts. I held on to myself. security men noticed something was wrong with me as I walked out of the office building. I dont want to draw attention. ""No one here needs to know what is going on with me"" i thought as I dragged myself to the car. Can I drive? my hands were trembling. I knew I had to call for help or else I might loose myself. My phone, I started searching for my Phone. I wanted to call out for Help. that was when I passed Out! Yes! the next thing I remember was being on the Hospital bed.

I live in Riverside county but have been going to college in San Diego for the last five years. This was the first summer I spent in San Diego instead of moving back home, so I was able to celebrate my birthday with my closest colleagues for the first time in well, ever. On this day, one of my friends invited me out to a bar to watch an NBA finals game. My roommates (who are also my friends) came with me to meet up with my other friend to celebrate. I had a great time at that bar, minus the fact that I did not eat much while there, so I was very intoxicated. Upon leaving the bar, one of my roommates decided it was a good idea to stop at Trader Joe's to buy a fifth of tequila. Looking back, this was a bad idea, but at the time, no one objected. It was my birthday and everyone just wanted to go wild. After arriving back home from the bar, we began taking shots of the tequila. It was very fun and we had some good electronic music playing in the background. Apparently, we ended up going back out to Pacific Beach and bar hopping. Unfortunately, I do not recall this at all as I blacked out after the second or third shot. Luckily, I woke up in my bed unharmed and did not do anything stupid. We recalled the night the next day and everything that I could remember was fantastic. I'm sure I had a blast while blacked out, but I can only assume based on what I have heard.",3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWRSU9NQ,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWRSU9NQ,0.0

I had felt it was just a normal stomach upset so i got antibiotics. Although, this wasn't the first time I would be feeling this pain. I have actually been feeling it for some years now but I have always attributed the pain to something else. I at one point in my life felt it was as a result of wearing underwears that were to tight, So i changed them and the pains still persisted. At another time i felt it was because my belts were to tight so i reduced the rate at which i used belts all together but the pains would always come back. Then, i gave up trying to find the solutions and endured the pains, and then after a while the pains left only for it to resurface after some months but then then the antibiotics worked which made me so sure it was going to work again this time  but it didn't.So, I got antibiotics, used it and expected to feel better but things got worse. It was so bad i couldn't sleep all through the night, the following day i had started calling people as early as 3 am in the morning. When help eventually came i took antacid and still nothing improved. So i was rushed to a nearby clinic and after diagnosis, i found out i had acute appendicitis and required immediate surgery. I  had the surgery and got better. This may look like a normal write up but there is no way i would be able to express the immeasurable pains i felt in this write up. After the surgery I tried to find out the cause of my predicament, i was told a series of things, some were applicable to me and weren't but i still found everything confusing because i have friends who almost the same i do and didn't have to suffer from the pains i did. I'm happy I'm happy I'm better now though, which i feel is the most important thing.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWW0RC9NF,0.0

The reasons for losing it were out of my control. In short, the company changed some guidelines and terminology. They didn't inform their employees, but each of us were let go for not complying with the changes. Yes, it really doesn't make it any better. I live in a rural area. Jobs don't exist that I qualify for. I was walking blindly after the layoff, desperately trying to figure out how I could possibly live on my savings, which is supposed to be for a car since I had to trade mine for housing. It was a struggle to get out of bed, and self-care was at zero. I would fill out applications like a zombie, knowing it would be near impossible to make an interview with my car situation. The closest town is 20 miles away. I looked into online jobs, but most required something upfront or they were scams. I went back to freelance writing and editing. However, I'm not great with marketing or self-promotion, so it left me with content mills. If you don't know, they're like the penny/underpaid hits asking you to write with an enormous chance of it being rejected because the ""client"" is picky or was unclear. I just couldn't do that and raise my family without feeling like I was treading water. Then I stumbled across a Reddit called Beer Money. I started reading posts from people who were making more than I was for far less work on a very specific site. This is how I discovered, essentially, my savior. Mturk approved me on the spot. It was a trusted platform, and while I won't ever become rich from the work, I'm left with satisfaction from doing surveys, little tasks, and even this one. The pay, although not perfect, will sustain me until I am able to find another job. I've been here for about 4 months now, and while I still have a lot to learn, I've never not enjoyed a task. The pay is almost a bonus--almost. After all, I do have a family to provide for since their father is a deadbeat.",,3D3VGR7TA11ZZUE1GD0NNLYKARXR39,0.0

We had been planning it for weeks, as a way to say goodbye to our friend Pablo, who would be leaving to Peru in a couple days. It was an important event for me, and I had to do a lot of preparation. First off, I had to find the venue. I looked all over town for various options, and made a list of the best choices. Then, our group voted on which restaurant to choose. We ended up choosing Anju, a new Korean place which had rave reviews. Next, I locked down the reservations, and made sure everybody knew when it was happening. However, we made sure to keep it a secret from Pablo, in hopes of surprising him. Once the night of the dinner arrived, I went over to Pablo's apartment to pick him up. He was a bit confused on what we were doing, but I told him we would go grab a slice of pizza or something. As we arrived at the Korean restaurant, Pablo begin to suspect that something was up. As soon as he seen all of our friends waiting outside, he knew he had been surprised. Everybody jumped out and yelled ""surprise"" in unison. It was really well done, and Pablo was laughing so hard he began to cry. We filed into the restaurant, and began our meal. We had a lot of laughs, told a lot of stories, and ate our fair share of delicious Korean cuisine. As we finished our main course, the staff came out with another surprise - a large chocolate cake, with ""goodbye Pablo"" spelled out in white icing. It looked amazing! Afterwards, I learned that our friend Javiar had set this up. What a fantastic way to end the meal. Everybody loved the cake - especially Pablo.",,3D4CH1LGEBFUP6U3HB7LFUNZQG89GI,0.0

This is a day that continues to be celebrated by individuals, and it seems I cannot get rid of this habit, either. I have come to love the day because it is personalized and individualistic. I am privileged to have  wonderful friends and family members, and on this day I was reminded exactly what I have. My dad, rarely at home, surprised me with a ticket to Paris. I have always wanted to travel to Paris, but I had not been able, and my dad made my dream come true. My mum gave a moving speech, my siblings shed tears of happiness, and my friends danced all night long. On top of that, my long-term partner proposed to me during the night. It was a surprise that was well hidden by everyone, and I was the only one who did not know. My partner proposed in front of my parents, and this was moving. And of course I said yes. He has always been a man of my dreams, and it was wonderful to get the surprise from him. This has to be the best birthday I have ever had. I got a chance to travel to my dream destination, listen to wonderful speeches by family members, and watch as family and friends were moved because of me. I really feel like there is no one lucky than me.",,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXORH3U6M,0.0

Pictured Rocks is a beautiful location. The sights are amazing. From starting in the woods, to crisscrossing rivers, to spotting waterfalls, all the way to the Pictured Rocks themselves. The titular Pictured rocks are sheer cliffs on the shore of Lake Superior. They have great coloring that gives them their name. Gazing over them is a memorable experience. Looking hundreds of feet down into the clear and turquoise waters is stunning. Lake Superior is always a sight to behold, but here is where she shines best. I really do love it there. The hike itself is fairly easy even despite a bump or two. Though, it was a bit muddy being spring. There were moments of tiptoeing and leaping around mucky mud. But it just added to the adventure. Rain was a possibility throughout the morning but it held off and the temperatures were cool and perfect. Just an all around great experience that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend the area.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV,,0.0

We had been friends for many years because we met when we were in fifth grade. When we found out that we were going to the same wedding, we arranged how we could go together. We also planned what we would wear. We went to the mall and bought classy suits so that we would look great for the wedding. My friend bought a linen suit because that's his favorite. I bought a very good looking regular fabric suit and got some shoes that go with it. As we were looking for shoes, we thought we'd also buy some new shirts. The store had very good and high end shirts on discount so I ended up buying two. My friend got two as well. We left the store and went to the gift shop to look for gifts that we would give at the wedding. I bought my cousin a pair of nice bed sheets and a blender. My friend bought my cousin a box of kitchen mugs. We went to the wedding the following day and had a great time.",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU3WO5N6,0.0

We decided to sell it. We both had mixed emotions about the house but decided it was best. We sold it quickly to an appreciative couple. That made me very happy.

To celebrate, I thought of a number of possible things to do.  I thought about having a party.  I thought about a small, intimate dinner with close friends.  But at the end of the day, I just thought I wanted to relax.  I went to the spa and felt extremely relaxed afterwards.  So in my mind, that was enough of a celebration for me -- I was able to have 'me' time and relax.  At the last minutes, my husband asked if I wanted to go to Las Vegas.  Of course I said yes!  My husband made the arrangements so I did not know where we would be staying.  When we arrived at the hotel, my husband took forever checking us into our room.  To my surprise, we stayed on a premier level of the hotel that had limited access.  The room was very spacious and had a really nice view of the Las Vegas strip.  Throughout our stay, we went to several restaurants that we had never been to before for dinner.  We usually do not spend a lot of money on dinner but since it was my birthday, we did something different.  Each restaurant was nice and I really enjoyed the food.

One of the most memorable things that happened on that trip was when my husband took me to the new Star Wars land in Hollywood Studios. I have been a huge Star Wars fan for over 20 years, so going to this land was really exciting for me. When we were in the land, my husband and I were going around the land and I was completely entranced with all of the details of the land. Now my husband is not that huge of a Star Wars fan. He hasn't even seen all of the movies, but he went through the whole thing with me and supported me as I nerd-ed out. As we walked through, he started asking me more and more about what he was seeing. I was able to explain a lot of inside things that a normal fan may not have known about. He really took an interest. Eventually we made our way to the made gift shop, the Den of Antiquities. This is hands own one of the coolest gift shops I have ever seen. The gift shop is divided into two main areas: one for the Light Side and one of the Dark. In the middle of the shop are the legacy lightsabers and a bunch of artifacts from other characters that did not fall into either side. We went back to that gift shop quite a few times in our time there, trying to decide what souvenirs to bring home. On one of our last trips into the shop, my husband asked me to step outside. Knowing he was up to something, I did as he asked with no argument. When he came outside to join me he had a small black, velvet bag with him. When I opened it I found a necklace. But not just any necklace, the exact replica from the one Rose wore in Episode 8. It was so amazing! Not only did my husband think enough to buy me a necklace, but he made sure to get one that he knew would mean the world to me. It was so surprising and really made me feel like I had someone that was always going to be there for me.",,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FL234G27,0.0

I just had to go, I must go! Nothing will stop me from going on my birthday!  My birthday happened to fall on a Saturday this year which could not have been better timing.   I told my husband I want to go out on my birthday this year to the new Star Wars land!!!  I felt he had no choice but to take me, it's my birthday! Usually I do not go out for my birthday it is just too much hassle especially when it falls on a weekday. But this was absolutely perfect! I haven't been out for years on my birthday and not only is it on a weekend, but after waiting so long for this park to open I will finally get to go and on my birthday!  I told my husband this is what I wanted to do on my birthday this year and I didn't care if we did anything else or not on that day, because I just wanted to spend the whole day there anyhow.  On the day of my birthday I could hardly contain myself.  It was finally here!  My husband made all the arrangements and took me to the new and very much anticipated Star Wars land! Once inside the park I did not know where to go first! I wanted to do everything at once, see it all at once but thankfully my husband was reasonable and we came up with a plan and that we should first walk around the entire park and take everything in.Just walking around and looking at everything was breath taking. I was so happy to be here and with my husband who seemed to enjoy it as much as I was even though he's not a huge fan of Star Wars like I am. After an hour of walking around we decided we would stop somewhere to eat and I was very excited about this as well because I wondered what all the wonderful food choices would be.  Once we found a place that wasn't too crowded we went inside and sat down at a booth and only after I sat down did I realize just how tired I was.  I was just sitting there looking all around when I turn to look at my husband and he is holding out a small box on the table in front of me. He says, this is for you. Happy Birthday. In all the excitement I had forgotten it was my birthday, and reached over and took the box. I had no idea what this could be. I opened the box and see that it is a necklace that is a replica of Episode 8!!  Wow!!! I could not believe this! What a perfect day this was turning out to be and what a wonderful surprise this necklace was from my husband!",,3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FL234G27,0.0

We made the typical remarks and I asked he if she would like to get a coffee.  We ended up at a bar we used to frequent in college.  We sat and talked for a while, finally establishing that we were both single again via divorce.  She was seeing someone but didn't know if it was going to lead anywhere.  I was sort of in the same boat.  We agreed to keep in touch and exchanged phone numbers and email addresses.  That was about 3 weeks ago and we have talked 2-3 times since then.

Still single even. Which is nice. Allows us both to talk about whatever we want without worries. Some partners get jealous when talking to ex's. So it was a great conversation. Hope to do it again soon. So I offered up my number hoping she would give me a call back. She agreed she would. Even said she had a good time. So there is hope that she will. Could be a lot of fun.

On my birthday this year, my husband bought me tickets for the two of us to go see them in concert. To top it all off, he bought us front row seats! My excitement was overflowing and I could not wait until the concert date.  My husband did not think he would have a very good time seeing an old boy band, but he was wrong. The day finally came for the concert and we made the hour long drive into the city. The whole way there I blasted NKOTB songs through our car stereo. When we got to the venue I could barely contain myself, I cried tears of joy as we parked. This was it! We made our way in and the energy was so uplifting throughout the concourses in the venue. First stop, a concert tshirt. My husband was still trying to act like cool, like he was just tolerating this for my enjoyment. We entered the arena and were ushered all the way to the front to our seats. I couldn't help but turn around in circles looking at how big this place was. All of the seats would be filled soon, but I was up front! My husband started to smile as he saw my joy. The lights dimmed and a wave of screams erupted as music began to play. In a flash of lights NKOTB took the stage. I felt like a young teen again! My husband laughed and smiled as he saw me jump up and down with overflowing excitement.

I was SO excited that I was finally getting the chance to see them. I have loved the band since I was a kid, so at least 20 years. Not only did I get tickets, but I got tickets in a really great area of the venue so I had a good view. We had a lot of fun at the concert. Before the show started they had a block party set up with a bunch of neat things to do. People sang karaoke and took pictures of themselves with big cutouts of the BSBs heads. I got a shirt that is actually a little big for me so I wear it as a night shirt. The venue we went to has a VIP club that you can purchase for an extra cost so you don't have to stand outside and wait in line. This was interesting and fun because we got to sit in an AC room and have drinks and food without having to worry about losing our spot in line. It also had a private bathroom that we could access during the show if we needed to. The show itself was SO good. The boys still sound as good as they did 20 years ago. They sang all the songs I was hoping they would sing. I'd love to see them again in the future!",3DHE4R9OCXXJPM94W2S657FLL412GB,,0.0

We've been playing together for a few years now and have played a number of gigs in and around our home city, but this was a big opportunity for us. The festival was held in a nearby park so there were lots of beautiful areas around us. We got to play in front of a few hundred people, and people really seemed to enjoy the music that we were playing! Though some of the people moved to and fro throughout the festival, there were a good portion that stayed to watch our set. We played for about 40 minutes in total, for a set that included 6 original songs and 1 cover. The cover was a song by the Grateful Dead, which is one of our favorite bands. We chose that song because it always goes over well when we play it live. The most surprising part of the story is that we even had the opportunity to play at all. We didn't know about the music festival until after the deadline to apply, but we sent an earnest email to the festival organizers asking them to consider our late submission. They must have responded well to the sample and the email that we sent them because they agreed! It was such an amazing opportunity. Even though we played in one of the earliest time slots, there were still loads of people enjoying the activities and it was a very meaningful experience for us. Playing and performing music is one of my life passions, and even though it isn't my career, it's still nice to be recognized for the hard work and to be given an opportunity to showcase that work in front of local fans.  We had so much fun and I hope they continue to let us play these types of events in the future.",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7CBNGE8Q,0.0

It was like the best surprise I could have gotten regarding getting another car. The year and model of the car I wanted wasn't new. It had been really hard to find this kind of car with low miles, for a price I could afford, and in an acceptable color. I was willing to accept anything in the 2007 - 2010 range. People told me it wouldn't be possible to find a car more than 5 years old with low miles. Someone said, ""Good luck with that, those cars aren't made for sitting!"" Well, I came across some good luck. Because I would be making a major purchase and would have to travel a long distance to get this car, I made sure to ask all kinds of details about how the car could be in such good shape for 10 years old.  It just so happened that the car I wanted was part of a fleet of police vehicles, and not just another patrol car. It was being used by a government official and it was not driven very often. The best part of all was that on top of the car being in such good shape and the price being somewhat affordable, when I told my salesman that I didn't have as much money for a down payment as they initially requested, I was able to negotiate the down payment amount and the price of the car. I was able to negotiate the whole deal before and get approved for a loan before I even got to the dealership. I had to travel about 230 miles one way so the salesman worked hard to arrange everything in advance. All I had to do when I got there was take a test drive and sign the paper work. They even game me more money for my old car towards the down payment than I had anticipated.  Everything fell into place for me so well, with the exception of having to make monthly payments, it was unbelievable.",3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TTE86,,0.0

The process was long and soul crushing. Me being a man fighting for full custody was not respected in the same way it would be if I was a woman fighting for custody. Things eventually worked out for the my children and I, but i'm in a lot of debt because of the court, and lawyer fees. Its crazy to me how the court let it go on as long as they did, especially considering there was proof of abuse. The children's mother has gone off the deep end, and started using drugs again. I talk to her mother often, so the kids can see their grandmother. She keeps me in the loop with what's going on. Thanks to me now having full custody, I can move wherever I want, and place the children in any school I want. At the end of the year, we may decide to move in order for me to pursue better career options. Since getting full custody the kids have been great. My one son is doing really well in school, and behavior issues have stopped. The mother calls every once in a while, but unfortunately the kids are not all that interested in talking to her. Its become difficult to force them to talk to her, especially since she never sticks to a schedule when calling them.

I could never afford to get a new car due to constant changes in my life and financial hardships. After many years of longing for this car, I had finally found an older model that I might be able to afford with a lot of budgeting. I was so excited. But because I couldn't get approved for a loan, the car was sold right out from under me. I was devastated. I had been working so hard for many years and it seemed like I was worse off financially than I was when I was in my early 20s. In my late 30s, I couldn't even afford a 10 year old car. Then just 4 months ago I started having yet another problem with my car and I new that I had to do something. I couldn't keep putting money into the car just to have it breakdown again in a few months. As I was driving one day I came across the kind of car that I had been wanting for 12 years now. I went to the dealership and learned that it was a complete rip off. It had high mileage and the dealer wanted too much for it. This prompted me to go online to see if there was another car out there that was similar but with better mileage and a better price. I stumbled across a car more than 250 miles away that was exactly what I had been wanting. It was old, but it had really low miles and the price was very reasonable. Again I did my research. I contacted my insurance company, applied for loans, and developed an annoying relationship with a guy at the dealership. The deal fell through at first because I couldn't get approved for a low interest loan. But I knew this car was meant for me. I waited a few days and called him back with plan. After about 30 minutes of negotiating we made a deal for a somewhat affordable down payment and a tiny bit off the total price of the car. He agreed to hold it for me until the next weekend. My family and I drove the 250 miles and after what seemed like forever, I got my new old car.",3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TTE86,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TTE86,0.0

It was when I finally broke through the marketplace and succeeded in getting my business ventures off the ground. Even though this wasn't my main job and was a side business, it was still very significant to me personally. I've been researching over the last few years about how I can make extra money through some kind of online business. I have been trying very hard to do different things but it's been very difficult getting something to work. Many people who try these sorts of things give up and fail. However, it turns out that it's not something that I'm incredibly interested in doing and the money isn't that great. I've realized that it's not worth it working so hard for something like this, and it would need to make a ton of money in order for it to be worth it. Even so, it's good to know that this thing is there whenever I need it. It's always good to have a backup plan. Additionally, it's not certain that the business will be a good long term investment. Despite all of these setbacks, it's a great learning experience and it's given me much more confidence to really pursue great things. I realize that my side business should be related to my current job. That way making time for the business is also helping to make time for my career and further me along that. Overall I would say that this journey has been worth it so far.",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7CRGQE82,0.0

Today I met with Ted, the guy who was selling the camaro I was looking for, and we finally came to a negotiation on the price. I met Ted about 4 months ago, I was sure he'd reject my offer, but now that I have the money from the bank loan, I'm planning on sending him the payment tomorrow. Well, let me go back a bit, it's been about 6 months since I've written anything and I didn't want to write about the disappointment of not getting the car, so I'll start with the craigslist ad. I've had some money set aside for some time now, and thought that it might be a fun project to get an older car and fix it up on the side. So, I checked out craigslist and found this camaro with a beautiful body, but it needed a bit of engine work. The funny thing is, it didn't really have high miles, it just sat in someone's garage for a long time. Ted was the man who posted the listing, so I contacted him and set up a date to check out the car. He wasn't able to meet me that day, but told me to meet him the next day at his mom's house. Apparently, the car was Ted's dad's car and when his dad passed away, his mom couldn't get rid of it. But she also couldn't bear to drive it either so it sat neglected for nearly 40 years without anyone even turning it on. So, when I met Ted, the car was pushed out into the driveway, and it was amazing. It was in pristine condition other than the engine neglect, so I made my offer. Ted said he couldn't go any lower than $15k though and I only had about $9000 in my account. I ended up meeting with a bank to take out a small loan for the remaining amount but only offered him $12k. He agreed and we went down to the notary to sign the paperwork. I had a towing company bring it to my house, and pushed it into the garage to start working on it. The car still needs a bit of work, but it'll be a really fun project so I'm looking forward to learning something new. I feel pretty empowered.",,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TTE86,0.0

I was staying at my parents' house because my father was ill and in the hospital. My mother was spending nights at the hospital with him, and I would go during the day and spend all day there, staying alone at my parents' house at night. It was a stressful time. The night before my father was scheduled to come home, I woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains. I was terrified, and thought I was having a heart attack, and all alone. The pain subsided after about a minute, and I didn't know what to do, but I eventually decided just to go back to sleep. In the morning, though, I felt off, and after speaking to my mother and my husband about it on the phone, called an ambulance to go to the emergency room. I hurried to get dressed, but the ambulance was coming from less than a mile away, and they arrived while I still had my nightshirt on, over a pair of jeans. The EMTs came in, and there was a flurry of activity, with people taping electrodes to my chest, giving me baby aspirin to chew, and asking me a million questions. The next thing I knew, I was on a stretcher, being wheeled out to the ambulance that was out in the driveway. They took me to a different hospital than the one my father was in, which was inconvenient for many reasons. Once at the emergency room they taped more electrodes to my chest and hooked me up to a monitor. They drew some blood, and asked a million more questions. Then... they left me alone. My brother arrived, having been sent by my mother to come and sit with me. He was able to stay for a while, and we talked, and I waited. Eventually my brother had to leave, and the nurse came in and drew more blood, explaining that if I had had a heart attack there would be hormones in my blood that would be at certain levels for the first and second test. Eventually they told me I would need a stress test, and after more waiting, I was taken upstairs for that unpleasant ordeal. Then... I just waited. For hours. Eventually someone came in and told me that my test results indicated that I had not had a heart attack, and I was fine, and I could go home. No explanation was given for what had actually happened, which was shocking to me; I could not believe that they didn't have an answer or some kind of diagnosis, or even any kind of advice, the doctor just said there was nothing wrong, and that was it. All I got was a sheet of paper with reasons a person might experience chest pain. So, I called my sister-in-law to come and pick me up, and then waited in the waiting room, hungry, annoyed, confused, and wearing my Star Wars R2-D2 nightshirt over a pair of jeans.",3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92WKSWP6,,0.0

I have spoke about her often. I have pictures placed throughout my space. Her picture is my screen background and saver on my phone. I visit her and my other dog's grave every day. I speak to her letting her know I still miss her and love her. I think of her often and remember the things that she did. I remember her attitude, her disposition, and the things that she did.

The oddest thing happened though. It snowed. It was late spring and it was totally abnormal. Even the locals were amazed. It made the night even better and created great shots. I took so many pictures of the architecture and snow falling. It truly made everything better and more ornate. I liked the fact that is was unexpected. It added to the whole dynamic of the scene.

I trained hard and smart for the event and did carb loading, etc.  I wasn't quite sure if I could do it, but I wanted to push my limits.  I started off taking my time and made good progress.

Also with us we had 2 cats and a small dog who all had to get onto an airplane that would be leaving at 8PM. We went through security and bag check, It was a very stressful venture with so many things with us. We sat quickly to eat since the flight would be about 10 hours. We ran to the terminal and loaded everything on the plane as quick as we could. It was the longest and worst plane rides I have ever experienced. The people on the plane were very loud and alot of kids were actually on this flight. Around 12PM I was able to uncomfortably fall asleep, I woke up and it was light outside and they served us breakfast. Shortly after that we landed in Portugal. We had a 8 hour layover which we could not leave the airport at all for this duration. The dog had to go to the restroom and the cats were very upset, but they were not able to. After awhile our next flight was there and we had to load everything back onto the plane. The next flight was only 2 hours and we arrived in Prague around 12AM and had to figure out how to get a cab and make it to the hotel. We had to take 2 cabs that ended up costing 45 US dollars per cab. We got to the Hotel and realized it was in the red light district downtown. We still liked the hotel and stayed there for about a week before we found a nice AIRBNB in the next district over. I quickly went on the hunt to find an apartment and met a German man who was a reality agent who helped me out within around 2 days. We quickly paid for the apartment and moved in the next few days.

We had a great time together going from freshman who barely knew anything about the world to sophomores to juniors to seniors. During college we both partied a fair amount. In the beginning we mostly just smoked weed together and went to parties and drank. Eventually we got into the EDM scene and began doing MDMA for concerts and festivals and coke at parties. The drugs were always a secondary aspect for me though and I figured it was the same for him and everyone else. Towards the end of college and after graduation things started slowing down a bit. I transitioned to having a job and going out and partying less since I had to wake up during the week but he was acting differently. I found out that he had been using opiate pain killers since the end of college but I didn’t really understand what that meant or the significance of it. I figured it was like any other drug, a secondary thing that one used to enhance certain situations. I began getting more and more serious about work and at the same time it seemed like he was going farther and farther off the rails. He never ended up getting a job and began asking everyone we knew for money all of the time. I didn’t understand what was happening and as he became stigmatized in our friend group I cut him out of my life more and more. To me it just seemed selfish and hedonistic. I found out he began using heroin at some point and the latest thing I heard was that he overdosed and passed away. I feel a lot of regret for not being there to understand what he was going through and help him.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG8HMQP3,,0.0

It was particularly memorable because it was my parents 50th wedding anniversary. Because of different circumstances in my personal life, it had been 4 years since I had seen my family in person. The last time I saw my nephew he was just 9 months old, now he was almost five. My other nephew was just a boy last time I saw him, now he's a senior in high school. It made me realize how time flies and how much I have missed not being near my family for the past 4 years. For my parents anniversary I had found some old pictures of both my mom and dad when they were younger, and a few from when they just started dating. I restored these pictures in Photoshop, printed them out and made a picture collage that I gave them as a gift. It made my mom emotional seeing these pictures of how young they were, and I think she was sad because life is so short. One of the pictures in particular was difficult for her, because it was one of my mom and my aunt when they were just teenagers, and my aunt has recently passed away.  My mom was so happy though with this gift, and anytime someone came over she proudly showed it to them. It made me happy I put in the effort of giving a personalized gift. For their actual anniversary, the whole family got together and we went for a hike in a nearby forest. After the hike we had dinner at a pancake house and finished at my parents' house for dessert. I will treasure this memory forever.",3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZCT8SVF,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZCT8SVF,0.0

I finally have a chance to tell the story, and what a story it is! About a month ago, I was driving home. You know that road right past the freeway entrance? The small side road I take to avoid the light at the end of the main road? Well, I was going down there, and apparently a deer mistook my car for a doe or something, because there he came, running right out of the woods straight at me! I'm no killer, so of course I swerved to avoid hitting the poor misguided fellow. Unfortunately for me, I swerved right into the yard of this nice old couple, who thankfully didn't have the time or energy to fix the ditch at the front of their yard. That beautiful ditch was the only thing that came between me and serious injury! It enabled me to slow down enough to stop. When I did, oh boy, was I eager to get out of that car! My heart was pounding so hard I thought I would die right there! The male half of the old couple ran out, and checked to make sure I was ok, bless his heart. Just some soreness, I told him...and a totaled car that I was pretty sure was going to chew up my insurance deductible. ""No worries, son"" said the old man, ""I'm a retired auto body guy and can do it for you for the amount the insurance pays and no more!""I am so so grateful! Not only did I live to tell the tale, but I also managed to get my car fixed for no out of pocket cost. Well, diary, I'm off to buy some anti-deer whistles for the car. Hope they work!

One of them was someone my husband really does not like at all. These were coworkers as well as friends, and my husband used to work at the same place I work at, so he knows them well. That's how he knows this specific person and how he gained this antipathy for him. Anyway, my husband claimed that this man only invited me out for a drink to ""get back"" at him or like, prove that he's capable of getting me to do things, sway me in a certain way, or whatever. This made me really mad because it's like he's saying people can't just enjoy my company, they would only invite me if they had ulterior motives. Also, it wasn't just one person, it was a group of people! So it's not like I was just having one drinks with one guy, which I would never do because I am loyal to my husband. Furthermore, my husband is not normally jealous and he does trust me, so this just threw me entirely for a loop. He wasn't accusing me of doing anything shady, he was accusing me of being naive, which bothered me a lot anyway because I'm not a naive person. I just think he has a huge blind spot where this dude is concerned. So this fight erupted because I could not see his side at all, and he on the other hand was being a macho macho man and would not back down because it's like he has to stake his territory. We went back and forth for awhile and honestly didn't apologize for a solid day. Normally if we have an argument it gets hashed out quickly. Neither of us get into prolonged fights.

My mom lives out in the country and missed me so that was perfect. We got on the topic of abuse, or the KKK, Iʻm not sure what led to what. We look really white, but the look in her eyes and the way her voice changed when talking about the KKK moved me to ask some really hard questions. Most of my life I just heard snippets of my past, that my grandfather was handsome and abusive. That he passed for white because he was tall with blue eyes but that he was Native American and that, even with a high school education, couldnʻt get hired anywhere because he was native. She opened up to me how abusive her father was, how he would beat her mother and tear her clothes off, how she got one of the first restraining orders issued in Oregon, how her father would sit outside their home and try to convince her three younger brothers that their mother was evil. She used to race home to grab her brothers before he could get to them. She told me how the KKK used to threaten to burn their house down and thought that with their father gone it would be a good time to get rid of them ""once and for all"". The fear she lived with amazes me, how any of them turned out to be good, loving, human beings astounds me. I found out that my grandpa is buried in an unmarked grave in Oregon. Iʻm thankful that she decided to make her own money and not rely on some guy to provide for her. This led her to get an advanced degree in science and retire as a Lt. Col.

Kids got enrolled in one of the states most prestigious school districts and my spouse landed a much better paying salary working in the same field. Things couldn’t have worked out better for us but I do think about my classic car. It was a sacrifice to exchange for security for my family. We had so many memories with that car being passed down three generations.  although our basic family sedan we own now could never compare to a classic it’s more reliable and I don’t have to worry about expensive body work or repairs. On our 25th wedding anniversary the kids surprised us with the exact model. With the kids out of the house it’s been great spending time customizing it. Now we have the money and time to really enjoy a classic car and not have to worry about upkeep. We take her to road shows and have a special garage made just to showcase. This time around we plan to take as many pictures and have already included her in two family weddings and countless birthdays. It’s important to celebrate what you have when you have it but also know their order of importance in life. People first, places next THEN things. Things come and go.

Around three months or so ago I talked with my supervisor about possibly advancing through the ranks. I mean, I've been with the company about two years now and it's somewhat strange working with people fresh out of college. Anyway, he was totally on board with that and hinted at an opening in management that would make me a team supervisor, but it wasn't really up to him (it's the coordinator's job to pick and choose promotions). So I shrugged and tried to win the part. I came in early every day, helped answer questions from the new people in the office, and even took on that extra project from the finance department. Of course, three months later that opening gets taken by some new hire. I was feeling pretty dejected but apparently the coordinator took notice of my efforts and actually gave me a small raise. That was a nice incentive, and plus I can add some finance related stuff and other employable skills to my resume. I guess all in all I'm not even sure if I would have liked the management position anyways, and it's got me wondering if maybe I should take what experience I have from this position and move on. The pay is good, about decent for a data scientist, but I'd really enjoy taking on some more long term projects or having a leadership position. Working here was invaluable as someone new to the industry and trying to learn the ropes, but if there's no hope of working my way through the ranks, then it's probably best if I part ways. I'm a little stung about the promotion, but honestly I'm not upset about it anymore. The raise was at least something, and I'm thinking with the experience I got from the finance project that I can look into a job at a bank corporation that reached out to me. It would be a smaller office and more tight knit environment, which I think I'd prefer more. Still, I wonder if I should just hold out and wait to see if I can perhaps grab another position onboard management. It's a lot to consider, but I'm sure it will all work out.",,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGOQPU,0.0

We went to Watertown which is in Upstate NY with a bunch of people that live at the halfway house that I work. We all rode together in a few cars and the van and had a lot of fun just getting there. When we arrived it was quite beautiful, it was raining but that did not stop the fun. We seperated into groups of 6 or 7 and went down the river with a river guide. We made a couple stops to swim and do waves with the boat. It just proved to everyone that it was possible to have fun in sobriety. It was an unforgettable day for all involved. I do have a vivid memory of people flying out of the boat and seeing them pulled back in. It was the entire staff from the mens and womens houses so although it was a work trip - it was the same as being out with a group of close friends. It was something I had always wanted to experience but it would have been hard for me to afford. Just seeing all the guys together having fun and being able to participate is a memory that will stick with me. I now have checked something off my bucket list. Being in nature is always something that I enjoy and this activity was so much fun. I think back on this as something that is once in a lifetime.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,,0.0

She recounted her extreme fear of the KKK at the time. As a young black woman, she had to live her life in constant fear of being hunted down or beaten by the group just because of the color of her skin. And it was random, they chose solely based on superfician circumstances whether or not to kill someone--if they didnt have a reason, they'd make one up. However, my mother was particularly afraid. She had no one to protect her. Her father was an abusive man, not afraid to beat his children at any moment for any reason. He was a monster. I had never met him, for obvious reasons. But, essentially, he had left my mother at a young age to the wolves. He didn't care what happened to her, and she was in fear everyday that one day she would be killed, and she had no one to defend her. Her mother couldn't do anything, she was weak and sickly. So everyday she had to live wondering whether or not it would be her last day. Luckily, she survived; however, the damage to her psyche is obvious. I feel nothing but anger for what happened to her, and I can never forgive the people who did that to her.",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GL9FS3I,0.0

I thought that if they just could remember what it was like to be together, especially after trying to date in the modern world, that they would want to get back together. At first they were resistant. When we all arrived they felt betrayed and both wanted to leave. But I convinced them that we were all adults, and we could all have a good time. They stayed for me. The trip was 5 days long, and on the 3rd day, I saw something incredible. My parents were at the beach holding and kissing each other.  I couldn't believe that my plan actually worked.

I was meeting with the new clients at the office and the suggested we go do something really different. I wanted to impress them so I pretended I was on board and said I'd try anything. White water rafting! That is what they suggested! I was terrified. I can't swim, and I am scared of boats. I felt like an idiot admitting those things, and I really needed to impress these clients, so I agreed. I acted excited. I was so scared I couldn't even breathe. When we got to the river it became obvious that I had no idea what I was doing. I couldn't put the safety gear on without help. I felt a lot better that at least everyone knew I was a fraud, but that didn't get me out of participating. They insisted I follow through. I could have refused, but then they wouldn't have wanted to work with me anymore I was afraid. The entire day was amazing. I have never been so scared but so alive in my entire life. I can't say I've gone rafting again since then, but I still remember that day fondly. And the best part? I closed the deal!

It was the event I had the most fun with this year. I went with my clients from work and also some coworkers. It was at a river about 3.5 hours away from where we live. It was a very memorable experience. I work at a halfway house for men being released from jail/prison with substance use issues, and it is privately ran by a church and there is another house under the same church for women, which is our sister house. I have never been white water rafting before but my girlfriend has and both of my parents have been. I have been wanting to do something fun like this for a while because it has been a while since I did something extraordinary. The car ride was long but worth it and the day started out nice and warm, but as soon as we got to the destination, the temperature dropped and clouds started rolling in. The destination was also northeast farther upstate. When we arrived, we all changed and checked in. We had 2 vans full, 1 for each house, and about 2-3 car fulls of people as well. Everyone put life vests on and either wet suits or wet shoes. We all headed out to the water after teams were made and we got into our assigned boats. Each boat had an instructor who taught us how to paddle and when, by his direction. It started to rain as soon as we got in the water and it was only about 50-55 degrees fahrenheit. I'm running out of time for this study but the rapids were extremely high and fast for the season. It was a crazy experience and I almost fell out of the raft a couple times, and some people who I know did fall out. We took a break halfway through and after it was done, the workers grilled food for the people who rafted.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,0.0

It five months ago on an unusually warm day for it being so late in the year. We were making our holiday plans and I got a phone call from a mysterious phone number. Even though I don't usually answer calls from unknown numbers, I had a feeling that something may be wrong. You know that feeling you get when something just isn't right. You can't really explain it, but there's just something not right about things. I weird omen perhaps. Whatever it was, I knew it had to be important, so I answered the phone. The all was from an old college friend of mine who I hadn't seen in over 10 years. Ginny's voice sounded very strange, a bit shaky, not like the person I knew in college. The last time I talked to her, she had just been through a very serious round of chemotherapy, but was taking it like a champ and was in full remission. Why was she calling me, I wondered, but knew the answer. Her cancer had returned and was in full force now. I listened to my friend talk, and tried to encourage her as she fought back the tears. She was calling me to say goodbye.  I always think of myself as a strong woman, not easily swayed by emotions, but Ginny's story brought me to tears as well. It made me realize how short and precious life really is.",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GMWY3SN,0.0

I feel a whirlwind of emotions. I'm so proud of myself for not giving up even though there was many times I wanted to.  From struggling with my grades and not always getting along with my professor's, to all the social pressures of trying to fit in. College life is a hard road to follow but it's finally over and I can enjoy the feeling of relief. Although, I am somewhat saddened to know that I will be losing the closeness of some dear friends I have made along the way. My friends helped me to push through some difficult times, they were almost like my family. Especially when I started partying to much. They helped me get back on track. I will always cherish the time we had together as we all move ahead to better ourselves and find careers. It's bittersweet to think college life is over but I can't wait to find what's in store for my next journey. With a degree in my hand and one hurdle behind me, I'm ready to take on the world to achieve my happiness on a whole new level. The life I had in college has prepared me for challenges that I am ready to face. I feel blessed to have made it this far. I can't wait to start the next chapter in my life. I feel like I am prepared to take on new and bigger responsibilities now. HERE'S TO WHAT'S TO COME!!!",,3E1QT0TDFQV87SHO271A0A54UMII81,0.0

This year was their 25th anniversary as a band and my boyfriend and I both love their music. We share the same love for music and the majority of the same favorite bands. This experience getting to see Collective Soul together (our third time) was awesome because we got a great deal on our tickets. Not only did we get a great deal on our tickets to get to see Collective Soul in their 25th year as a band, but we also got to get much closer to the stage than we originally started out. Our seats once we moved were about 7 rows from the stage. It was such a great experience together because we know all of their music and enjoy it together. Another reason why this is such a memorable moment for me/us is that one of the first few times we spent time together, we went to my first ever Collective Soul concert and it was such a great show. The coolest part of our experience was getting so close to the stage and getting to sing along as well. Collective Soul has always been a favorite band of mine due to being brought up listening to it because of my parents. It has always been a great band and wasn't bad music for me to listen to as a child. This band has brought many great memories and feelings between my boyfriend and I because the love for the music that we both share. A few of the things I think of from that night would be the Bud Light Orange's we were drinking which had such a crisp and refreshing flavor. Then we ordered some nachos which hit the spot because we were quite hungry after the long day we had and not having dinner yet.

We decided to end it on mutual terms. Things had not been going well for quite awhile. My reasoning for wanting to end things was mostly because my partner was not the best at communication. When I would tell him that things were bothering me, he would get upset and refuse to talk to me. He would often ignore me for hours after. I believe that communication is one of the most important things in a relationship, so obviously this was not going to work. We hadn't been in a relationship for all that long. It had been about a year. That did not make it any easier though. I still think about this from time to time. Over than the issues that we had, things had been going well. I was happy. However, I could not deal with not being able to talk to the person that was supposed to care about me. I feel like it was for the best to split up.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ1LUGNV,0.0

When I started to feel depressed or detached I would consult my virtual playlist of childhood songs and allow myself to drift away and become immersed in the happy feelings that immediately followed. I was shocked at how well it worked and how long the effects lasted. I even went so far as to download the songs and play them when my memory of them would fade. I also use them as ringtones for my close family and friends. This has made a noticeable difference in my mood upon answering their calls. Since I've been using the Disney songs as a therapy of sorts, my friends and family have noticed a change. I have accomplished tasks that I had no interest in achieving and I have a new hold on my emotions. Just yesterday I got some news that would have been very depressing in the past. My dog ruptured his ACL and requires surgery. The procedure is very expensive and will be followed by many weeks of recovery. The reality of the situation is still setting in, but I am handling things much better than I expected. I already have a plan to pay for the procedure. I will be calling the vet to schedule the surgery later today. In the past, I would have handled this situation very differently. My depression would have kept me from acting and my dog would have suffered longer than necessary.

I now have the distinct pleasure of calling that surprise my wife, and even all this time later I can hardly believe it happened. I was walking through the park in historic downtown, a place I often go to gather my thoughts. Writers block had been plaguing me for days and I thought a bit of fresh air might do me good. I got so much more than I bargained for that day, much more than fresh air. Aubrey is a breath of fresh air to me today as much as she was that day. Anyway, that day I was lost in thought. I rounded the corner without looking or even realizing how far I had walked and bumped into the most alluring woman I'd ever seen. She had red hair and the greenest eyes my eyes have ever met. I had just bumped into her, even causing her to lose what I know now was a very expensive coffee, yet she smiled. My apology was met with laughter and so began the best adventure of my life. We got to know each other over coffee, of course I had to replace hers since it was my fault she lost it, and conversation. We talked about literature, music, and ideal travel destinations. We talked about school and the past and the future. We talked about everything and I swear we were in love by the end of that long conversation. Love finds you in the most surprising places.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ2FCGN2,0.0

We were in our rental car and driving around the town of Brisbane. We got lost and were very confused as to which way to go because the sun was setting and we were tired from a long day of sightseeing. I was exceedingly nervous as the area we were in didn't look very safe that we had driven into. At the time, I was driving and my mom was navigating us using a map. I was getting more and more upset mostly from fear. My mom kept telling me to call down but I couldn't. She finally told me to pull the car over and we were in the process of trading places. As she got into the driver's side of the car, she actually drove off and left me there on the street corner before I could get in! I had left my phone in my purse inside the car as we were changing seats. I had no way to contact anyone and I was beyond freaking out. She wasn't gone that long, but if felt like a lifetime!

Then I lost the qual without warning. I sent the requester an email and they never got back to me. It was costing me money not to have it, and that made me very sad. Even though I am a timid person who hates making waves, I started emailing them a lot. Finally, they emailed me back and told me I broke their rules, but the rules I broke were not even stated in the HIT! After some back and forth, I got them to admit that the situation was unfair and not ideal. Then they decided to revise the rules to make them more clear. They gave me a qual test and I passed and got the qual back. I was incredibly, incredibly relieved! It was like getting a job back after losing it. I felt this rush of relief and it totally changed how I view my Mturk workweek, because it increased the amount of things I can work on and made me feel less pressure. I hate when I have no work to do. It makes me anxious and stressed and I start worrying a lot about money. Since getting my qual back, I feel a lot less anxiety and fear. I'm very grateful that I spoke up for myself and that they gave me a second chance.",,3E4GGUZ1T9DOR85NMTDL3Z7EXXXK24,0.0

It was a normal day in Portland Oregon.  I was in the bathroom and some dude was shooting up in the stall. I told the staff to watch out he may be using in the bathroom.  It turned out to be true and he overdosed.  After about 30 minutes of waiting for him to emerge, they finally called the police.  He was out in the bathroom stall but still breathing.  I actually know the guy kinda which is weird well I have seen him a few times.  They were able to bring him back to life.  He was taken to treatment hopefully he sticks with it but it is very doubtful.  It is one of the problems with liberal cities.  They totally allow people to use drugs anywhere and sometimes even help them inject in some cities.  In every bathroom in portland there is a used needle trash can.  I do not support drug use around the city and in public or really anywhere.

We might go to a bar or club and then call it a night. This year he said that he will make a special night for me. We went to a restaurant downtown where he made a reservation. I had never been to a restaurant where I had to make a reservation before. The food was great. We got to have many different dishes that I hadn't had before.  I had a blueberry martini which is my favorite and the waiter brought me a creme brule with a candle in it. My boyfriend quietly sang me happy birthday in my ear and then we left. We then went and saw a live band at a bar that we go to quite often. They were really great.

My son got a job in a completely different city and state and even part of the country than we live in. I needed to help him search for apartments. I had to find something that would be safe and something that was a little cheaper. This was an emotional time for me because even though my son has been off to college and graduate school he was always in the same state as me.  We needed to help him pack up his things from his Graduate School apartment and get him off to start his new career and life. I was very sad and happy and proud at the same time. I think that part of me didn't want him to move away.  It made me think about when I was his same age and it was at that time that I moved away from my family. I remembered how my father cried and cried. He was very sad and didn't want me to go. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. So it made me think about that as I was packing up my son's things. I am grateful for today's technology that allows us to physically see each other. I will miss the face to face time.,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2CA1D9S,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2CA1D9S,0.0

My SO work me up and we took her to the doctor in the morning. It turned out that her pulmonary valve was resctricting the blood flow to her lungs. so we ended up going to the hospital having her admitted.  and she had her open her surgery within the next 2 days (July 12th).. It was super scary not knowing the outcome. they fixed her heart within 4 hours but she will need another open heart when she is 11 or 12 years old. We go to the cardiologist every 2 weeks to check the function of her heart. we also go to the her regular pediatrician. She is also on Lasizl (dont know the correct spelling). it is a water medicine because she developed chyle after the surgery.

It's been five weeks now but the feeling I had on that day has no diminished, and if anything could be said about it it has grown. It was on that day while I was contemplating lukewarm leftovers on the counter that my mom announced I had received a package from Jonathon. This was unexpected and curious. For the first, I hadn't spoken or written to Jonathon, Jack as I always called him in youth, in several years. To the second, I hadn't lived at home for two years while attending graduate school, and any mail delivered to me there would be odd.  Upon unraveling the package from Jack, my heart rose and sank in varying emotion. The enclosed Frisbee from Vermont College School of Arts was a specific choice by Jack designed to invoke our shared history and demonstrate his love of dog, Charles. Jack had only met Charles on one occasion but my interaction or conversations since must have made an impression as to my feelings for him. I had always thought Jack to be thoughtful and caring, but this was an unexpected surprise. I had not been in the best of moods all day or all month for that matter. The competition in my program was not what I had envisioned when enrolling in the English department nor were the endless days of meetings and workshops. I felt stunted and exhausted with little to show for my effort. Jack's gift and accompanying note was like a tablet of vitamin C that returned some sense of energy and well being to my mood after a fog of despondency. I never thought that another person would show such dedication to a memory and sense of the moment as Jack. His gift exposed a great deal about his character that most would not care to do as it would reveal a vulnerability. To care that much about a person is a fragile thing indeed and to have it demonstrated in public without an idea of the consequence frightens most from such action.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2DOS9D8,0.0

Not much in the way of close relationships and not a whole lot of random acts of kindness have come my way.  That's whatever.  It doesn't bother me and I don't expect stuff like that to happen so I typically don't feel the lack.  About six months ago I started a friendship with someone in an internet forum where groups on people that primarily work online sort of gather to discuss things during the day.  We've talked frequently and even though we don't work together so to speak it has many of the qualities of a work friendship.  Anyone that knows me knows how I feel about my dog.  I'm quick with the pictures and he get's a fair amount of mentions in my day to day conversation.  My boy is terribly allergic to fleas and they've been very bad this year.  I've been fighting to get them under control and for the most part it hasn't gone well so my dog has been miserable. It bothers me. A lot.  Point being that I've discussed the flea problem and solicited possible solutions that I may not have tried yet within this group of people.  I haven't gotten much in the way of feedback because I've tried everything there is to try.  You're probably wondering where I'm going with this and I'm getting to it I promise.  A few Saturdays ago I took the dog for a nice long walk around the neighborhood relatively early in the day. It was gorgeous out. Bright and sunny.  That was nice but it really highlighted how bad off my poor pup was doing and I was feeling pretty crappy about the whole thing when we came back around to our street and headed down the driveway.  When I got to the door to go into the house I saw an Amazon box sitting in front of the door.  It had my name on it so I brought it inside and opened it.  Inside was one Xtra Large Seresto Flea Control Collar and 1 container of freeze dried liver treats.  She took it upon herself to order a flea control solution and a container of treats so my boy would feel better.  It was the nicest thing anyone had done for me in quite some time. I was touched.,,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2DOS9D8,0.0

She had been living on the streets for almost a decade with very little human interaction.  There was a man that would come and steal her puppies to sell them every time she got pregnant.  When Elsa came into our rescue she was totally shut down.  She looked like she wanted to die.  I was there that day and made it my mission to become her friend.  Over time I won her trust and within a few months she was snuggling and rolling over for belly rubs.  She came so far that she was actually able to go into a foster home.  Her foster eventually adopted her and Elsa had a forever home.  Elsa had a great life in her new home.  Several years later, just a few months ago, she had a massive seizure and was unable to recover.  Her mom decided it was time to let her go.  When she let us know, a whole group of us went out to be with Elsa and her family.  Elsa went from a dirty street dog fighting for her life daily to a well loved family dog.  She passed away peacefully in a room full of people that loved her.  The group of us that worked with Elsa were all there to support each other during this difficult time.  It was truly amazing to see the impact that one dog had on so many people.",3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2KYGD9R,,0.0

I approached his manager and asked to discuss the situation with him in private so the coworker could be talked to about the inappropriate activities on a work computer.  Well that blew up in my face.  After that I was asked to document in writing exactly what I had seen and this information was given to the HR department for review.  About a month went by and I had heard nothing so I assumed the situation was resolved.  That was until the highway patrol came into our office and was asked to escort the male coworker from the office and he was let go.  While I felt horrible for what had happened, I knew this person could have prevented it by simply nothing watching pornographic images on a work computer.  Fast forward another month and management calls a meeting.  It is told to us at this time that the male coworker would be returning to our office after the company settled outside of court to allow him to have his job back minus some benefits.  I was floored and very disappointed in our management team.  But I prepared myself for his return the next day.  It was horrible!  The coworker came back knowing I specifically reported the incident and from the moment he walked into the door he made it a difficult situation.  He wont speak to me when I ask questions.  He wont have anything to do with me even after he was told by others that I never tried to get him fired.  Now, I dislike my job and coworker even more for making the environment hostile.  I cant for the life of me understand why this person gets to stay after getting caught watching porn.  On top of that the office is well aware of why he was let go and now it sets the precedence that rules don't need to be followed and we can get away with anything here.  To make things even more disappointing, I was passed up for a promotion and was told by a coworker this morning that I would never get a promotion in this office because of that incident.  I at this time have decided its best to look for a new place of employment.  This is not the environment for me.",,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWTW21JF,0.0

Growing up, I grew up with four sisters. Suffice to say, the experiences between myself and my sons are vastly different. Yesterday, I went to the doctor because I haven't had my period in weeks. Lo and behold, he confirmed I was pregnant. This is my fifth time getting pregnant, and as exciting as it is, it's still nerve wracking. I remember being nervous when my fourth son was born. I was the mother of four boys. In eight months time, I'll be the mom to five children. I am definitely as nervous or more nervous than I was when my fourth son was born. I'm going to get a sonogram to find out the gender. After having four boys, I'm not sure if I want a fifth boy or my first girl. As nice as it would be to have a daughter, I feel that having a fifth son would be an easier transition. None of the boys know how to operate with a female sibling around. My biggest concern is that if I have a daughter, she will feel isolated and alone. However, and as selfish as this sounds, if I do have a daughter, I finally have someone I can share girl things with.",,3EFE17QCRDRQUHLDANPUHP4Q51HSHK,0.0

I don't cry as often anymore about her even though I think about her everyday. I started to cry while playing with our new dog that someone dumped in front of our house. I had wish I could have had a few more months with my dog. Playing with the pup just made me remember how she was as a puppy. I think a good cry can help with your emotions and after it I usually feel better. I don't think there will be a time that I don't miss her but now I am starting to remember all the good times I had with her. The camping trips, the trips to the lake, the playing in the yard and her love of chicken. The new pup we rescued after she was dumped she has sure helped me with the heartbreak I was feeling. She came to me at the right time. I think as you get older pets tend to mean more to you because they are your constant companion. When my kids were younger I was always on the go because they were very active in school. Now that they are all grown and I have retired I spend a lot more time at home. My dog became the animal who was with me all the time so her death made a huge impact on my life. Now with this new dog it is helping fill that hole left by the passing of my beloved dog. I will never have another dog like her but Casey is helping me over the heartbreak.",3EG49X351VYIT9NV8E4DJ6WS1WT6X9,,0.0

I had been dating Sweet-T (Nickname) for over two years, and I was becoming incredible displeased with the relationship, but with her living with me; breaking up with her would be incredible hard; she was having a harder time cover her real self. She was lying more, and more, being incredible manipulative. For instance, she was talking to someone she used to know, and apparently would send dirty pictures to, saying she was single. She denied sending any new pictures, but I knew I could no longer trust her. She would ask for money to pay bills, than not pay them; leaving me to scramble. She would says he was somewhere else, and literally slip in a conversation giving away her true location, and by this point I didn't care. I became withdrawn, and distant attempting to get her to leave, but she seemed intent on using me for as long as she could, so I began to withhold. I withheld contact, ignored her messages, and apparently, most importantly, I stopped giving her money. This drove her cray, and it didn't take long for her to break things off. I wasn't sad, or hurt, but deeply relieved I could be free of this vampire draining me of resources. Doing all this without ever taking her own actions into account. I got out of the relationship, and got her out of my house without having to kick her out. I did not want to make an enemy out of someone I once cared deeply about. I do not miss her company, nor her self indulgent, narcissistic attitude. Once you live with someone they have a much harder time hiding themselves, especially if they are below average intellect; she has told me she regrets how she handled everything, and she regrets leaving; I don't.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4GVAJ8E,0.0

Everyone around me kept assuring me how young I really am, and how I still have so much life left, yet I can't help but just feel like an old geezer. One thing happened that changed all that, though. I told my best friend that I wasn't too excited about my birthday and not to do anything too special for me. This was a huge mistake.

I went to work, ate my daily breakfast, did everything I usually do. Then, when I got home, he, along with all of my other friends and even some family all shouted ""Surprise!"" as loud as they possibly could. I was in complete disbelief.

We both thought that this was intentional so we decided that the next day we will plan a surprise trip to Las Vegas. We were only going to spend two days there, though I wished it could have been longer. The next day we got there and we checked in to our room at a really nice hotel. We placed our bags down and went off to the strip to go explore. We went into a lot of hotels and gambled for hours. Later that night we tried to gamble more but I could not find any of our money. We had spent it all on gambling all day. We just went back to the room and decided to go to sleep. When we woke up I had remembered I left some extra money in the bags. It was only twenty dollars but it was enough for some good breakfast. After breakfast we had five dollars to spare so we decided to just put it in a slot machine. We thought all hope was gone when we put that money in that we were expecting to lose. But just then we saw all the pictures lining up and we won over a thousand dollars. We were very exited and went to cash it in. We stayed an extra night and got some gourmet food for breakfast lunch and dinner!",3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK471PJ8W,,0.0

I knew his days were numbered and my girls were also having a hard time with it.  He passed about 3 weeks ago so its still a very fresh hurt and considering the relationship we had it will hurt for a very long time. We will now be helping his wife get their house in order.

This was one of the best things that happened to me because I always need a push to get out and do daring things. I am so glad that I decided to go because we had such a great time and I met so many awesome people. I made additional friends and will continue to be friends with them going forward. When we were there I could not contain myself for how much fun I was having. The music was pumping and I could not stop dancing and having a fantastic time. They were playing my favorite music the whole festival and it could not have been better. My friends were really fun and we danced for what seemed like several hours but it was actually only a few. There were drinking and drugs but i did not partake as I don't believe in doing them. I was very well behaved and only had fun without any toxicity. We can always have fun without toxic substances. This is why I am so glad I made the friends I did because they understand me. One of the greatest gifts is having friends that fully understand. I hope to have these friends for the rest of my life.,,3EICBYG645I6E6R7112FEXGNXSAJC2,0.0

I was thirty six weeks pregnant and not expecting to have him for three more weeks at my scheduled c-section when I unexpectedly had to go in to the hospital due to the fact that I was not feeling him move much.  I went in for monitoring and they kept me overnight.  They monitored his heart rate and it kept dropping, so in the morning they decided they would go ahead and do the surgery.  They couldn't figure out what was causing the decelerations.  I had left my house the previous night at eleven p.m. not thinking I would be staying overnight and certainly not thinking I would be having a c-section in the morning so I was totally unprepared.  All I had with me was my purse and my husband was back home with my other three children who had been asleep when I left.  I excitedly got ready for the surgery, knowing that within the hour I would have my baby in my arms but also nervous that he was going to be okay and that I would be going through surgery all alone.  Everything went smoothly though.  The anesthesiologist was really caring and sat right next to me throughout the surgery and talked to me.  When I finally heard my son's little cries, I knew everything was going to be okay.  She held him beside me while they finished stitching me up and then finally after nine months of waiting I got to hold him.  I went to recovery and held my perfect little son in my arms while I waited to go to my room.  Then, I spent two nights and three days in the hospital with my new little son.  It was hard because I had never been away from my other three kids before, but it was also special having that time just him and me together.  It had turned out that he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which is what was causing the heart decellerations.

Because of a fight in the family, my husband's side of the family wasn't there to celebrate with us. We went out to a restaurant she loves for dinner with my parents. We had dinner and then ordered cupcakes for desert. We didn't sing because she would be embarrassed. The most surprising part of it was that my son who was 1.5 slept through the whole thing. He laid on the booth next to my husband. We did have a good time but it was a little sad without my husband's family. The worst part was the my in-laws did not even wish my daughter a happy birthday. They never sent her a card or anything. Luckily my daughter is still happy and okay. We made sure she got everything she asked for as gifts. She was happy with what we did and her gifts. I consider it a success even though my husband's family managed to put a damper on it. My daughter knows we love her.",3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39WR6Z6,,0.0

We threw a little party for her at her favorite restaurant. We only had close family there. My daughter didn't want a big party this year. As she gets older, she is more shy and less uninhibited. She doesn't like to have the spotlight on her any more. I am very proud of the young woman she is becoming and watching her grow so quickly has had a major emotional impact on me. I couldn't believe we were celebrating her 15th birthday already. She is my oldest child and I had her when I was pretty young. Along with her grandparents, her dad and I were there celebrating with her two younger brothers.  The youngest slept the whole time so that was pretty nice. The middle child, my 8 year old son, was his usual antsy self and made it a little bit frustrating by getting up and running all over the place. It was nice to have time together though and she enjoyed herself overall.  I have to admit it made it me a little bit sad because all her grandparents weren't there. Her aunt wasn't there either. We had a falling out in the family so we aren't currently speaking. So while this was a happy time and I was so glad to see my daughter enjoy herself and the gifts she received there was definitely a little sadness in that.",3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39WR6Z6,3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39WR6Z6,0.0

The plan was to have the baby and then a tubectomy.   The baby was delivered as planned and the tubectomy was performed successfully but the tubectomy took much longer than anticipated.  The 30 minute procedure took close to 2 hours.  It was horrible laying on the operating table awake for that long while the doctor did the procedure.  The anesthesiologist did their best to keep me comfortable but I found them to be very obnoxious and just wanted them to shut up.  After what seemed like eternity I was done and they wheeled me back to my room.  I had never been happier to see my husband and new baby.  I was on a lot of medicine but held and feed the baby while my husband did his best to keep my comfortable.  The first couple days were really rough and painful.  The staff did a great job at staying on top of my meds and helping me shower.  They also took the baby at time at night because my husband could not stay in the room with me.  He was staying at the hotel across the street with the two other kids.  He wanted to stay safe just in case I needed him.  We went home after two nights at the hospital and for the most part everything has gone as planned.

As we were walking through the city and meeting with CEOs i realized just how small we all are. We went up to this place called MT etna and i secretly took acid with one other member of our group and i just had a sense of clarity up on the volcano that i dont think i will ever have again any time soon. Everything up there seemed in place looking at how the bees would fly around and the grass would sway even looking out over the city it all felt as if it was in its place. It all somehow came together to form life in a strangely organized way. Afterwards on my own i took the time to visit a cemetery one of which was rough a mile long it was a big circle (the city was catania). There i wept for the child graves and the graves that were forgot by everyone, i wept for my own death and the deaths to come of everyone i knew and loved. At the end of it though i had a much deeper understanding of why it is we must be grateful to even wake up in the morning. There was alot of joyful moments however as we went out to eat and explore. The professor with us had gone before and roughly knew were to go and even knew a bit of Italian. I was the youngest in the group unfortunately. This obviously lead to teasing but i dont think it was ever out of bad intention. While walking around i ran into a lot of stray animals which was great cause it would always be the cats who ran away but the dogs who would run up to you. The ocean also took my breathe away because they have rocks along the edge and ive always seen sand so naturally i jumped off some rocks into the ocean. The timing couldn't have been better because at the time i was there apparently there was a lot of other people from other university visiting Italy at the time too. There were times where i was scared i was going to have my bag stolen from me so i kept a broken bottle in my bag just encase i had to defend myself which looking back it now was kinda dramatic.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,0.0

I don't know why I couldn't have him naturally but I really wanted to so I was incredibly disappointed.  I was also set to have my tubes tied during the surgery since I figured I want to be done with children, with him being my 5th live birth and everything.  After the surgery was done I was super messed up on a ton of medication so I started regretting having my tubes tied.  I asked one of the nurses how the doctor performed the procedure as I know that some tubaligations are reversible.  I was then told that the doctor REMOVED both of my Fallopian tubes.  MUCH to my surprise, that is absolutely irreversible.  She went on to tell me that with IVF I would still be able to carry but given IVF is expensive, He is absolutely our last child.  I felt super violated, given I had no idea that parts of my body were going to be removed from me.  The doctor also performed kind of a plastic surgery on me she tucked some of my extra skin inside of me and sewed me shut.  Some people would think YAY but not me because the stitches couldn't hold all the extra skin.  About 5 days after my incision I noticed my skirt and panties were SOAKED. Like super duper wet.  It wasn't bloody but scary enough where i went to the emergency room. Its not everyday your clothing gets soaked from a strange liquid oozing from your incision.  The ER doctor told me I was doing too much and to slow down.  At my appointment a few days ago my physician told me there is a hole that looks like a person took their finger and poked my incision in a spot.  That was where a pocket of liquid was. It was all due to her performing extra surgical measures that weren't asked for.  SO now I am barren AND deformed.  Kids, man.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCO54X2DU,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCO54X2DU,0.0

Our 18 year wedding anniversary. Me and Susan actually made it. And what a delightful evening it turned out to be. Now, me and her have always tried to explore the culinary world as best as we can. But, tonight, we decided to go back to our roots. Luckily, I had the perfect restaurant in mind. There is this little hole-in-the-wall Italian place that my parents used to take me to when I was young. So, as I knew the wine would flow that night, we took an Uber to the location. It was absolutely perfect as I rented out the whole restaurant (and made sure I tipped the wait staff accordingly. There were lights, there were cheesy Italian songs, it was great. We got there, sat down, and had some bread and some sort of antipasto to start. We managed to get through most of a bottle of the house wine before we even reached the main course. Now I definitely said we were going back to our roots so these were very basic meals. I had a simple carbonara while she had fettucini alfredo. Both were divine as we tasted each other's dishes. After a few more glasses of wine and some incredible cannoli we went back to our house to enjoy some incredibly expensive champagne and some incredibly passionate sex. It was the perfect anniversary.",,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRBIUTJD,0.0

I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed. It has really changed my life in so many ways.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,,0.0

I called a buddy of mine that does renovations and interior design.  I had known him since college and I knew he does really good work.  He answered right away and we planned a time to meet.  We met a few times over the next few days and he planned an amazing new kitchen for me.  I could tell things were not going to be cheap.  We chose really nice finishes and new stainless steel appliances.  I chose a color palate of and gray and white with yellow accents.    My friend started the remodel.  My house was full of dust and debris, and I seemed to be bleeding money.  But my friend worked incredibly quickly and my new kitchen was done in only 9 days.  I was so over budget but when I saw the result I was blown away.  I feel like I'm living in an HGTV show and I love my new kitchen!",,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRJPFTJK,0.0

I finally decided to contact my friend who is an interior designer, to talk to me about options and budget. I told her that my top budget was $10,000 and she said that that was do-able. So, I went ahead and hired her. She was to help with design and project manage the remodel. Her contractors came over to measure etc, and I received the quote, which ended up being $10,000 PLUS the cost of all the new appliances/fixtures. i was a little frustrated as she knew my total budget was $10,000 but the new estimate would be around $14,000. I cut a few costs where possible, but we went ahead with it. I had told her the sort of countertop i wanted, but when it came time to select the countertop, the ones I wanted were double what i had initially been quoted, therefore I had to compromise and go for a cheaper countertop. My friend also gave me a presentation with several options of fixtures to chose from (sink/faucet/lighting) and i was surprised that most of the options were more than i had initally been quoted. In the end I was happy with the remodel, however disappointed in how much over budget we went. I also felt a little taken advantage of by friend. I wish she had been more upfront about the total cost, as she surely would have known given she does this for a living. Also, I had to tell some small white lies to my husband who was firm on the $10,000 budget. I am wanting to remodel the guest bathroom in my house, and this time i will hire contractors myself, and will to the design/project management without any help.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRJPFTJK,,0.0

I follow her on instagram, and for many months i was daydreaming about what she could do for my kitchen. It was dated and dark, with a brown granite countertop and a horrible brown mosaic tile backsplash. It was the original kitchen from when the house was built in 1999. I gave her my ideas and told her my budget was $10,000 and she had her contractors come over and we ended up with a estimate of around $10,000 plus the cost of the appliances i wanted to buy. I needed a new cooktop, sink, faucet, pendant lighting and i wanted to put in a wine fridge. I decided to go ahead with it, and I was able to go with my friend to pick out the new counter top as well as the back splash tile, which was very exciting. There were so many options which is what i needed my friend for. Construction began just a couple of weeks ago, and we had contractors in the house for about 9 days which was somewhat disruptive to my family, as we didn't have a kitchen for that amount of time. With two small children, that was a bit difficult to deal with. Anyhow, we managed to get by and ate a lot of takeout! When it was finally done, the kitchen looked amazing and I was so happy. I ended up with a white/grey veined quartz countertop, and a grey herringbone backsplash tile. My favorite part though is the pendant lighting and the wine fridge! I wasn't quite honest with my husband though, as the total cost ended up being $14,000 including all of the appliances.

How did I get these injuries one may ask? Well it started in my teens I enjoyed dirt bike racing, I was pretty good at it for awhile. I won my fair share of trophies and ribbon. But the NAtional Championship eluded me. My frustrations grew and grew, so I pushed the limits. I would increase the speed on the muddy curves when in reality I should have slowed down. Then one race I lost my control of the bike in the third turn of a rather muddy track. I flipped over rolling onto the track instead of off to the side. When one fellow biker could not elude me he rolled over my right leg and right arm causing breaks in both appendages. I was in traction for 6 months and I never could bring myself to get back onto a motorbike. BUt the daredevil in me still was my demon. I took up mountain climbing, I scaled the likes of the Half dome, the Matterhorn. But my one objective was Mount Everest. I embarked on this journey with a group, Half way up we experienced a massive blizzard with temperatures dropping to -20 degrees, we dared our luck an went on, with no shelter as we climbed I lost my footing and tumbled several hunfred feet breaking both legs both arms and a concussion, But with the blizzard rescue was far off I ended up losing 4 fingers and 6 toes due to frostbite. because of my concussion it caused some damage to my brain and I developed seizures, and to think this was jus 1 year ago",,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,0.0

We have been waiting for this moment for 23 years! My wife and I have always dreamed about our kids having a grandchild but we were doubtful it was ever going to happen. Our children said they were never going to have kids and were not interested in the thought. When we got home with him there wasn’t a thing I could do but look into his tiny blue eyes! He was such a small bundle of joy and so innocent. It brought so much joy to my wife as we haven’t had a baby in the house for 15 years. She was so compassionate about caring for him and it brought a new spark to her life. You could see it in her eyes that she wanted another child to take care of since our nest has been empty for so long. We were giving him a bath when she turned to me and asked can we keep him? They didn’t even want to have a child and now they have been blessed with this beautiful baby boy. I told her no but we will always welcome him in our home with open arms. We did not agree on this subject and she demanded we find a way to keep him or adopt our own. I don’t know what to do about this situation now because we are getting up there and age. All I know  is that I love this boy and he is always welcome in my home. I hope my wife will be able to understand my stance on her wishes.,,3EQHHY4HQTEBOJSRELU43EIXMDVG58,0.0

All her friends from the past were part of the ceremony and it was quite uplifting. I was glad they shortened the ceremony a bit. They had original plans to do a lot more and spend more time on ceremony type things. But in the end they just focused on things they both liked and what they knew the guests would like also. So the main focus was on food and games. Not so much the formal aspects. They had so much food to choose from. It was quite entertaining the different choices they had. So much variety in foods. It probably went along with their multicultural families and life styles. Overall one of the best weddings I have every attended.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,0.0

In addition, she mentioned how she was excelling in her current role with them and really enjoyed the work. She mentioned that I would be a great fit for an open position that they wanted to fill. This company was over 3,000 miles away from where I live. However, the most surprising thing is that they were willing to let me work remotely! This was definitely a surprise to me, especially since it is uncommon to have a full-time employee work remotely in this specific industry. I was shocked and extremely grateful for the opportunity. This experience was significant to me because it helped me be more grateful with my current circumstances. I also felt a closer bond to my former coworker and felt a sense of thanks, especially since she helped connect me to this position. I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me. I also learned about my specific feelings around work and my circumstances. I really need to reflect more and learn to count my blessings.

It's the most frightening of all my health issues.  My health has been declining for many years. I started having terrible migraines due to child abuse suffered at the hand of my parents. That abuse actually began again from them when, as an adult, I had to move back into their home. My father tormented me endlessly while I was there instead of being supportive and helpful as I tried to rebuild my life and get back on my feet. He actually struck me one day. So, I had to leave immediately.  My PTSD became severely agitated, as well as my anxieties and depression. I struggled to hold down jobs. Homelessness was a constant threat. I developed IBSD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and many more debilitating conditions. My life became one loss after another. I was continually abused in various dangerous roommate situations. The SS administration denied my claims for disability like it was a game to them. I continued to succumb to additional health conditions such as permanently torn muscles and connective tissues as my body slowly gave out under the pressures be demanded of it. My neck bones began to squeeze my spinal cord from a disorder called stenosis. This made me lose sensation in some body areas and gain exquisite amount of pain and function loss in m neck, shoulders, arms, elbows and hands. The pain ravages so intensely that, during an episode of intense hurting, I thought I had gone into shock. My eyes rolled back in my head, I lost my full conscious connection to my surroundings. My body trembled and shook uncontrollably, rumbled and gyrated. It felt euphoric and other-worldly. I was grateful and terrified, simultaneously. The episode caused intense emotional turmoil. Since that first time, I have seized many, many times.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,0.0

It was a simple affair in the backyard of a friend's house. She was marrying her girlfriend of 5 years.  My parents were there as well as my dad's sisters.  Also in attendance were her girlfriend's family and friends.  The service was lovely.  Both brides tried to hold back tears of joy as they gave their vows.  Those tears also brought tears to the audience's eyes.  Afterward, were took pictures with the brides.  While we were doing that, the food was starting to be served.  Everything was cooked by various guests of the wedding.  The best food served was the burnt ends brought by my dad.  The barbecue on them tasted great and the meat was so soft and chewy.  It really felt like it came from a professional.  Overall, it was a very fun experience.  I believe those 2 will be together for the rest of their lives.  They are perfect for each other.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQRC37MJ,0.0

I think we all took it as a shock, but I felt as though it hit me harder as I consider Mom my best friend, and we spend a lot of our time either hanging out together or talking with each other. Mom has always been there for me, and I decided right away that I need to be her saving grace in this time of need. I took me a while -- that day I went on a long drive after Mom told me she needed time alone to reflect. On my drive I pulled over on the coast, taking some time to watch the sunset and think about times past and how I need to be moving forward. It was sentimental, a few tears were shed for sure, but this was the moment I realized what I believe today and what I'm writing about. That is, I want Mom, no matter what happens, to feel the love everyday of her life. I want to make sure that everything I do for our family takes into account her wishes. This week I think I've done well to do that for Mom. Hell, we went skydiving two days ago! Ha, it was a blast, and it's not like her cancer is terminal, but it could be and I want to make her feel like we support her every step of the way and want to see her happy, as we always have. It just gets a different type of perspective when things like this happen. Since Dad passed last year, I feel it us kids' job to be there for her, and I know she just wishes she had him back to be by her side. We are trying our best, but most importantly it is about her. I will stand by her no matter what happens, she is my rock.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70,0.0

As a college student I was depressed and had a lot of anxiety. That was 15 years ago. So much has changed since then. I am now married with a child. I am an elementary teacher. In May my mom had her yearly mammogram. She received a call that she needed to have a biopsy. She had the biopsy and was told that it was not cancer. Two days later she received a call that it was indeed breast cancer. The following three to four weeks were emotionally draining. There were so many worries, questions, and unknowns. A plan was made and she had a lumpectomy followed by radiation and currently is taking chemotherapy.     My mom has always been the backbone of our family. She took care of me when I was diagnosed with depression and each of the episodes I've had. She spent four week living with me when I had a difficult pregnancy and delivery. Anytime I need to know something I always call her. I was devastated and couldn't imagine what I would do without my mother. I developed high anxiety but I stayed strong and didn't let my family see me struggle. This even has been significant to me because I know that you can't take anyone or any time for grated. I now try to live in the moment and always put family first.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70,,0.0

Sometimes my checks would be good but often I had to work a lot. I didn't really have many days off either. Eventually I was able to get another job. This job was way better for me personally. I had made a major life change by switching jobs. I make a lot more money, and I took a lot of stress off me. Due to having to travel and work longs hours to get some money to get by.

Because which was very excited moment for  everybody in our family.  Last year September my nephew was born and I  had the chance to go meet him in the hospital. it was really a very emotional time for me.  Holding my nephew in a soft manner makes my eyes tears. It was an awesome moment for my family members especially for me it was the  happened of the birth of my nephew was made me over emotional and getting very cold inside of my hands. my nephew’s birth was so amazing, but I almost missed it. When my sister first asked me to be in the delivery room when she gives birth I told her no I did not think that I would be to handle all the blood and yelling that I had seen on television, but my sister told me that its not about the blood and yelling it is about being a part of something amazing. After our talk I decided to do some research of my own to see how many people have actually seen a baby being born and what did they think of the whole experience. Everyone I talked to only had good things to say. They also told me it would mean a lot to my sister and my future nephew and god son if I would say yes, so I did. My sister was so  happy I that had change my mind and decided to be a part of the birth. This whole experiences made me and my sister closer than ever. The baby also bought my family a little closer to. I never thought that we couldget any closer before this whole experiences. Then again I never thought I would see a baby being born. My sister and I actually fight less and are truly generally happy. We try to always set a good example because we know that he is always looking at us. Seeing a baby being born puts a whole new perspective onlife. It makes you think about your life and the future. I had always wanted my sister to have a baby before I did. My sister had also asked me to be in the delivery room while she gave birth. She also asked me to be the baby’s god mother. I was so over joyed with excitement when I saw my nephew. Seeing my nephew for the first time was such an awarding and amazing experiences, one that I will never forget.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1USP2E01,0.0

This is the first time I've ever had a broken bone in my life. Aso the first time I've ever fallen so hard while skiing. I've been skiing for over 40 years, and I was on a relatively mild slope. In fact, I was near the bottom of a relatively mild slope when I noticed a large rut in the snow that I couldn't avoid. I fell forward, and landed on my left shoulder and left side of my head. Fortunately, I was wearing a helmet, and did not suffer a concussion. I was able to make it back to my car, get out of my ski equipment, and drive myself to the emergency room. Sure enough, X-rays showed a broken left clavicle. With such a break, it is not possible to put it in a cast, so I had it in a soft sling for 3 weeks. After that, I just had to let it heal naturally, which took almost 4 months. I am a pretty active person, so it was rough getting use to not being able to do all the physical sports I enjoy.  I play pickleball 3 times a week, and I had to stop while I was healing. I also had a tough time sleeping for the first month, as it hurt every time I rolled over.

I accepted my awards with modest and dignity and gave a rousing speech as I prepared my class to go out into the world and be conquerors. And ya know what, I think they’re going to do just that. I’ve never been so proud to see all those faces looking back at me with hope gleaming in their eyes. And I’ll never forget going out afterwards with my family and celebrating the night away.

I started realizing that I felt more for him than just a friendship after a few months of getting to know him. I knew that we would eventually meet up again to see how things would work out. I never wanted to tell him how I felt until I knew he was feeling the same way. One day I was working when I got a phone call from him asking me where I worked at. I was a little confused, but did not think much about it. I continued to work, as I was getting on break, I walked outside and I seen him. I was shocked! He actually drove 7 hours to come see me. It was later that day when I got off of work he took me to dinner and asked me to be his girlfriend. Of course I said yes. After months of getting to know each other, my soulmate and I hinted at our love for each other him first then me.

Specifically, I am referring to the time we actually professed our love for each other. It was a rather special moment because we had been playing the game together for several weeks and she had been chasing me pretty hard during that time. I'm kind of a celebrity in that game, and a bit of a ladies' man, so she really wanted to pin me down! I know this sounds ridiculous, but gamers are very strange and weird! It was a powerful time, because I'm an average looking guy (though I'm at the top of the pack in this game we both played) and she is a beautiful woman. I guess that's ""hypergamy"" at work! It almost felt like I was winning the lottery and ""too good to be true"", even though I would never admit to that since you have to play it cool and casual! I thought she was playing me for some sort of benefit in the video game, but the more we grew close to each other the more I realized how organic it was. Finally my paranoia began to shed and the event happened. ""I might be falling in love with you,"" she said. ""I'm thinking the same thing,"" I said. Later that night, when we said goodbye, it was a much more formal ""I love you"" exchange; I think we were both anticipating that moment, as it's a milestone of any relationship. I still remember all the matches we played that day, as well as the specifics of 99 percent of the Skype conversation (and subsequent voice chat). I won't get into the naughty details, but the entire day and night were burned into my memory. It was an important and genuine moment for both of us. Even though our relationship has since failed due to distance and drama, I still look back fondly and with no regrets.",,3FDJT1UU75UGQ5OA4CFJ16AQTWZ5KR,0.0

Now that the youngest one has graduated college and found his first job, we decided to sell our home.  We had it fixed up, remodeled the bathrooms, and had painters come and paint the walls. We contacted our trusted real estate agent and with her help put our house on the market. We were pretty confident in what the outcome would be. Our house was sold in 12 hours! The next step involved figuring out what would happen next for us. We had always wanted to travel more once our children had grown up and moved on, and we thought about some of the most cost-effective ways to do that. Well, long story short, we purchased an RV! We considered this to be a great way not only to travel but to save money on hotel rooms or staying in a rental home. While the initial cost of the RV was somewhat worrisome to us, we had an old friend that worked with someone in the RV business and he helped us score an awesome deal on a 5th Wheel RV. We couldn't be happier. We are able to live in the RV in one place for some time, and when we decide we want to go somewhere else, we do so very easily! It is so nice not to have to keep up with the maintenance and everything that goes along with owning a large home.  The minimal living with an RV is so attractive to us, and we will never look back!

I am a stay-at-home mom with 3 kids and my husband is a truck driver. At the time he was an owner operator and was taking a freight load to it's destination. Over in the night at a truck stop, my husband's trailer was robbed of some of the contents, which was boxes of frozen chicken. Not all was taken but a few boxes were. The truck stop, of course had no cameras, and he ended up having to file a police report and file an insurance claim. Since there was an insurance claim, my husband had to kept the load in his trailer until all investigation was over. With that being said, this investigation ended up taking over 2 months to resolve. First, it was trying to get an insurance claim person to look at the remaining contents in the trailer to see if they were still viable and can be sold off. Then, there was a back and forth for a moment, trying to determine if the insurance even covered frozen chicken. During these 2 months, still, my husband was not able to work because there was a load still on his truck. We blew through our bank accounts and our savings trying to maintain our bills and a household of 5. This put such a strain on our household and bank accounts. We have never experienced anything remotely close to this in our lives. To put an end to this story, after about 2 months, he was able to unload the contents in his trailer, however, by that time, we did not have any more money to maintain the daily expenses of operating a truck and had to give it up.",,3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGU4UPOX,0.0

He lost his miter saws, makita drills, and a lot of expensive woodworking chisels and levelers.  Fortunately, one of the neighbor's houses nearby had one of those smart doorbells and had video surveillance footage of the thief.  We called the police immediately afterwards and they were able to start on the theft with a decent lead.  The camera caught the thief's license plate too.  Unfortunately, my husband had a job lined up that we were counting on to help us pay for our bills, and he was not able to keep the job because all of his work tools were stolen from the trailer.  The police caught the thief within a week, but by then most of my husband's tools were gone.  We have the option of trying to sue the thief and claim some money in damages and lost wages, but we are not sure if it is even worth pursuing that, as the thief does not appear to be worth much money.  The hard part about this is because of our large family, we do not have much savings, and the two months that my husband was out of work, depleted all of our savings, and we were forced to sell our truck.  It was a tough decision, but we had no choice.  My husband will hopefully be able to buy a new truck if we get money from the thief.  While the two months were very challenging, surprisingly the event brought us closer together as a family.  Without his tools and not being able to work, my husband spent the last two month mainly at home with the kids.  He said to me last night, that while the loss of his tools and financial hardships were stressful and challenging, he has found the last two months to be enjoyable because of the extra time he was able to spend with our children.

It wasn’t my intended destination, it was supposed to be Brisbane. My flight to Bris was cancelled so they gave me a new flight which went to Perth, and then a domestic flight to Bris. Second part of the trip that was memorable. meeting a blonde, true blonde, on a date while I was there. I normally prefer redheads or brunettes. But I was in a new country so I wasn't going to hold it against her. After that getting to see the Great Barrier Reef. Needs no explanation. Finally, going to Italy and Seeing the Rome Colosseum for the first time for real. I could right at length about that. But suffice to say it was glorious. A real since of history.

I went and traveled to Japan and I lived there for three months with a Japan family. It was something I had been looking forward to my whole life because I have always had a great interest in Japanese culture. When I finally arrived in Tokyo for the first time, it felt as if I was in another planet. Everything was completely different. The people looked different, they spoke a different language , the architecture was completely different.  It was like a different world. I was so excited and I felt more alive than I ever had before. I was picked up at the airport by the family I was staying with and while I was very nervous at first I eventually got more confidence in myself when talking to them. They were very kind, friendly and they treated me like a family member. When I arrived at their house, it was more tiny than I expected, but I really loved the feel of it. It had a lot of Japanese traditional rooms including a tatami room which I really loved. The family took me around Japan to a lot of different cities and towns including Kyoto, Tokyo, Saitama, and we even flew to Okinawa as well. I really admire how clean the cities are in Japan and how polite people are. They are very friendly and helpful to foreigners. I loved every minute of this trip and it was such an incredible experience for me. I grew so much as a person and I got to see some of the most beautiful places on earth. I also made friends for life, I know have friends on the other side of the world and we message each other all the time.  This was by far the most memorable experience of my life. I can't wait to go back again in the future.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNWES2Q3,0.0

It isn't technically new, it's used, but it is still new to me. I haven't had my own car in so many years that I forgot how good it felt to own one. I was struggling pretty badly financially-wise these past couple of years as most of my focus is on my son and what he needs, but I decided some months ago that it was time to start saving up money for this big purchase. I spent countless weeks researching the best options in regards to safety, reliability, and price and I finally figured out what I really wanted to choose. I also read reviews on different dealerships as my credit is not quite the best so I had to make sure I went to a place that could qualify me without too much of a hassle. After I had found the right place, I planned a day to go down and search for a car that fit my criteria. Surprisingly, I was able to find a car right away. I took it for a test drive and immediately fell in love with it. After we got back to the lot, I made sure I asked all the right questions so I would not have any surprises (particularly bad ones) down the road. When doing the paperwork to buy the car, my payments were not actually as high as I thought they would be, as my down payment was a good enough amount to keep me in a reasonable range. I kept getting those excited butterflies in my stomach and could not wait to get the keys to this car. I could not wait to drive my son around and tell him that mommy got this all on her own and I was so proud of myself and I hope that one day he would be proud of me as well. I feel as though we sacrifice a lot as parents and sometimes our needs get put on the back-burner; but sometimes we do need to put our needs first to better care for our children. I will never forget that day.",,3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWGV5ZOP4,0.0

In the morning my mother sat me down and told me what happened. He passed away while my grandmother was trying to help him out of bed. He was coughing up blood and she told him ""Taya, your bleeding,"" and he looked her in the eyes, then closed his eyes and never woke up again. The day he died was one of the worst days of my life. He was the only father figure that I ever had in my life. On the day he died President Trump was visiting the city that I live in. A few days before a white nationalist came into my city and murdered over twenty people. My husband was on the way to that Wal-Mart but turned around when he saw many police cars and a police helicopter in the area. If he had left an hour beforehand he would have been part of that awful scene. I was still trying to process that tragedy and what had happened the day my grandfather died.     We had to navigate standstill traffic all morning and afternoon on the seventh while trying to get things settled at the funeral home and cemetery.  This was all due to that asshole Trump showing up here even though he was not wanted. In between talking to funeral directors and planning a memorial we watched Trump roll his fat body around our town on the T.V. At one point during the day we wanted to just go and eat some food together and talk as a family, but that took several hours because we had to wait for Chester Cheetos's motorcade to pass us on the freeway. In my life I had never felt such a strong dislike for another person as I did for that stupid man who came and made the day my grandfather died so much more terrible.  I could only imagine what the people who lost people in the shooting just days before were feeling. Many of them were planning to bury their loved ones on the same day we were. My grandfather died of old age, and it was expected. Those families lost both young and old, in the most unexpected and horrific way possible. I still think about that week all the time.",,3FE2ERCCZYU396R8MJGQ6TWG40APOF,0.0

It sometimes pays to just to put on a poker face instead of giving into my natural instinct to just run crying to the bathroom. I did cry, but at least I managed to make it home before the damn burst. Luckily, Pete didn't notice and I just made it seem like my eyes were puffy because my allergies were acting up. I don't think it's fair to get him upset just now during his final exams, but I will tell him about it when things look brighter.  Pete maybe only 15, but he loves me very much and often takes my battles as his own. He can't always understand that, as a single mom, sometimes you just need to put up with stuff. So this past week I have just continued to do my job as usual and I have kept my head down and focused. I also tried not to rehash the moment with any of my co-workers because just reliving it gives me anxiety. I have started to look for a new job but the truth is that its a bit scary to just jump ship and I don't want to do that until the right position comes along. I need to pay the rent. I really do believe in karma and things began to slowly put themselves in place when we got a sudden and unexpected visit from one of the regional directors on Friday. I get the feeling someone in the office may have contacted the head office and reported David because it just seems like too much of a coincidence considering that, after working there for 5 years, I don't ever remember any visits without prior knowledge. As a matter of fact, David would usually stress about these visits for at least a week ahead of time. I have never met a superior that was SO insecure of himself!!...It's beyond me how he ever got to the position of Department Head in the first place. Anyway, the next thing I know, Mr. Samuel begins to call us in for one-on-one private interviews in the conference room. I wish I knew what he asked of everyone else but from me he just wanted to know about how I was getting along with the latest project, which I was happy to tell him about. Then, he totally surprised me by asking me if I was happy.... I have not been asked that by any superior EVER in all my 30 years of work experience. And then the damn burst. I stupidly let it all out...tears, snot and all. I told him everything that David had said about me and my supposed ""lack of cooperation"" and ""selfishness"" and how he pretty much implied that I would never get a promotion if he could help it. All this screamed to me at the top of his lungs in the middle of the office. I told him that in a way I could understand how I had provoked David by refusing to change project group at this late stage of the game.

I remember having trouble sleeping the night before because I was so nervous about how I would perform, so when I woke up with only 5 hours of sleep, I felt like I was already setting myself up to fail. I was told over and over by my coaches and parents that this was just a competition and there was no shame in losing because at least I'd be learning something, however it was to no avail. I am very competitive, so it didn't really click in my head. When I got to the venue where it was being held, I felt like time was moving too fast, and soon I'd have to compete. I couldn't stop fidgeting. Eventually, it was finally my turn to compete. When I won my first match, I felt on top of the world. Then, I won another, and it felt even better. The momentum I started to build during my matches that day helped me build the confidence I needed to win my final match for that day. Sure enough, I did it. I was so ecstatic but I tried to remain calm so I didn't disrespect my opponent by celebrating. I hugged my parents and coaches and all of my teammates. It was only a white belt level competition, but I was still proud. It showed how hard I'd been working.",3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZW52QJ,,0.0

I was so incredibly nervous. I didn't want to lose and look like a fool in front of my parents and coaches, as well as my teammates. It was memorable to me because it marked the day I remember starting to have real confidence in myself, after I ended up winning that competition. I was only a white belt without any stripes, so I was only allowed to compete against other participants with my same ranking. I handled all of them with ease, and I knew it was because I had an incredible coach who was always teaching me important things I'd need to know. I knew my coach was telling me things the other coaches weren't telling their students, based on how easily I was beating them. The most surprising part of that day, to me, was how easy it felt to me to find ways to win. It meant a lot to me to feel confident enough in the finals of that competition, and it was all thanks to my coaches. When I won, it marked the genesis of when I truly became confident in myself, not only as a martial artist, but as a person. When I ended up winning the final match, I can remember telling my coaches that it was easy. My coaches told me it was only easy because I work harder than them, and that I'm more dedicated than them. I never thought that highly of myself. When my coaches told me that, I began to reflect on my work ethic. It was hard to compliment myself, but I allowed myself to after that day.",3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZW52QJ,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNZW52QJ,0.0

We had been quite close and known each other for years; we'd met in college where we became fast friends after randomly sitting together in the cafeteria one day. I still can't believe he's gone, I can't believe I'll never speak to him again. We had so many little jokes and shared experiences I will no longer be able to share with anyone else. Heck, sometimes I feel like we had our own little language. One year, for spring break, we went to Mexico City together. Rather than engage in the usual beach debauchery, we wanted to have a calmer experience. We traversed the city, trying to learn more about its politics and history. We couchsurfed with a cool couple of twenty year olds who were sort of bohemian. We felt so inspired, we all wrote a poetry chapbook together! I loved my friend's writing--he had a way of incorporating language with emotion in an incomparable way. God, I will miss him. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to read his poetry again--it might hurt too much. I feel even worse for his family though. They were blindsided most of all. I hope we can all come together and find some collective comfort.",,3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9MS2LGGE,0.0

But it was time for her to go to college, now, which meant that I'd be alone. I know it's kind of selfish of me to think of it that way, but I was really bummed. So I drove her down to her college, which is like ten hours away from where we live. The day we said good bye was... kind of disassociating, for me. I knew I should be sad but I didn't want to be, so I just kind of locked away all my feelings. I'd put together a video for her of all her favourite YouTube videos, so we watched that together before saying goodbye. She laughed and enjoyed it, and we had a good time. Then I drove her to a house where she was meeting some freshmen for lunch. I said goodbye and asked her if we could take a picture, and she teased me about taking a selfie (since I don't do that often). We look really good in the photo. I haven't posted it anywhere; it was mostly just for me. I like having something of her. But then we said goodbye, and I was trying really hard not to cry. So was she. But I was determined not to (I don't know why it mattered so much), and my throat hurt really bad from tightening so much. But I didn't cry, and she just teared up, and then we waved goodbye and I drove away. I kept thinking I should just let myself cry, but it seemed too much. So I locked it away and kept driving, and then within the hour, I was emotionless again.",,3FIUS151DWO94GHBVHDV7B9M13QGGU,0.0

I like these guys a lot, and have for a while, but I really didn't see their birthday gift coming (especially since I asked them specifically not to get me one). Where I thought we were just going to get some brunch and spend a quiet weekend hanging out as normal, I was duped into a trip to Philadelphia by my wildly over the top friends who I love a lot. Walking out of the apartment that morning I found them, with a car, all packed and ready to have a weekend trip, and they told me to go back into the apartment and pack my own stuff, after giving me a birthday card and explaining their elaborate ruse to me. I was flustered, to be sure, but I ran back inside to grab some clothes and toiletries, and we hit the road in the early morning to drive down to Philly. We checked into a hotel near Philly, came up with a game plan, and hit the town. The whole weekend was perfect. We hit the mural mile, went to Reading Terminal, climbed up the stairs at the Museum of Fine Arts, we did the whole thing. It was a great mix of doing what I love in Philly already (Reading Terminal, mainly), and then also doing a lot of new things. I'd always wanted to climb the stairs from the Museum of Fine Arts like Rocky did, because Rocky is a movie that means a lot to me. Sarutday night we returned to the hotel room, ate some of that famous Philly cheesecake, and played around in the pool at the hotel. Sunday we went back into town, hit some food trucks to round out the trip, and did the Mural Mile. Philly is a great city to walk around and reminds me of my hometown, so I really enjoyed that. Then, we had a fun car ride home. Taking car rides with these guys is always fun, because we get into crazy talks and go down fun musical rabbit holes while deciding what's going to get played over the car radio, so the ride there and back was a blast. All in all, it was hands down my best birthday ever, super fun and just way more than I ever could have asked for, kinda like my friends themselves.",3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN222ZPF5,,0.0

In April, she did a stool test and it came back positive for blood. I hate it when they call it ""positive"". What's so positive about it? It's bad news. They should call it ""OMG"" instead. She had had a history of bleeding and polyps. I dreaded the possibility of going through colonoscopy again. She would have to drink GoLightly and sit on the toilet all night long. She was then down to 89 pounds due to eating soft food because of bad teeth. She would be exhausted. I took her to see her doctor, and the doctor was reluctant to put her through all that too. I said a few days prior doing the test, my mother had gone to her dentist for cleaning and her gum bled some. Could that have caused a false positive? Her doctor said yes, it could, and could my mom re-do the test in a month? Sure, I said. So for one month I was worried, a dark cloud formed above our heads as we waited. A month passed by. My mom re-did the stool test. Then we had to wait some more for the result. The result wouldn't show up online, so we made a trip to the doctor's office to get it. IT WAS NEGATIVE! NO BLOOD! Yea!

Worries of how you’ll perform as a parent are overwhelmed as you look into their eyes and you know it’s going to be OK. Kids call you to a higher level of living.  I cried when my daughter was born.  These weren’t quiet, demure tears. They were big, breathless sobs. The very air sucked out of me as I held my baby, her own squalling cries drowning out my own. I was overwhelmed. I had never felt so much before. Conventional parenting wisdom says the day your child is born is one of the happiest of your life.  At the time I didn’t feel happy. I barely knew what I felt at all.  I was filled with an indescribable emotion—some mix of everything all at once. I was awed. I was humbled. I was proud.  I loved myself then more than I ever had before. I couldn’t be all bad if I had created something so small and precious. I held her and let myself be swept away by the feeling. I laughed—and even laughed as I cried.  I didn’t know I could love so much. I didn’t know anything in the world could be so important to me and so worth protecting.

The desert is cold at night, but tolerable. It's a lot to see and explore. Especially for a first time explorer, there's plenty to do from hiking to trail riding. There's the Marfa lights out in West Texas. The sight is pretty incredible. Though it is surprising when the lights suddenly appear in the dark desert sky. A bunch of people show up every evening to view the mysterious lights. Marfa is an artists based town. Which is good because the people are very nice.

It was a much needed vacation for my family and I...what with all the job and school pressures we deal with on a daily basis.  We all needed to relax a bit and a trip to a place none of us had ever been seemed like an adventure too good to pass up.  There were so many things to choose from!  We could visit Balmorhea springs, the Sonora Caverns, and even cross the border into Mexico!  I thought a road trip would be better than flying.  I was right because the scenery was beautiful!  I saw cactus as big as a tree and they kind of look like people from a distance.  I even saw a few tumbleweeds rolling across the parched desert landscape.   After a long but extremely fun ride, we finally arrived at Big Bend Ranch State Park.  I had heard this place was beautiful and thought camping under the night sky would give us all a break from the technology that seems to run our lives on any normal day.  I found the perfect spot, surrounded by towering mountains on one side and a clear view of the night sky on the other.  I had a rough time getting the tent up while everyone else went on a hike, but, finally I persevered.  Later, we sat around a crackling fire to roast marshmallows and hot dogs.  We laughed and sighed as we told each other our best ghost stories.  Then, as the sun finally dipped completely out of sight, an awe-inspiring thing happened.  The Milky Way came out to greet us in all her glory.  I had never seen such a moving sight as this, nor had I ever felt so small.  This was a trip I will never forget!",,3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNVWP3VR,0.0

(WKBW) — In isolated cases in various pieces of the state, Carlique DeBerry and Marla Fenner sold lethal portions of fentanyl. One got a 20-year jail sentence. The other got 5-long periods of probation. ""I think these two cases are not instances of something besides the realities. The realities and the law being applied accurately,"" Hon. Penny Wolfgang, a resigned State Supreme Court Justice, said. So why such a uniqueness between the two sentences if the wrongdoing was the equivalent? The explanation - government versus state courts. Carlique DeBerry, 40, Buffalo, was accused of ""dissemination of fentanyl causing demise"" in a government court. ""It was the medications that the individual disseminated that brought about the passing,"" U.S. Lawyer James P. Kennedy, Jr., said. That requires an obligatory least sentence of 20-years. Marla Fenner, 27, Geneva, a first-time guilty party, exchanged fentanyl for two yogurts and a squeezed apple. That individual later kicked the bucket from an overdose. The way in to her case is that she was accused of ""third-degree criminal closeout of a controlled substance"" in state court. ""Options in contrast to imprisonment especially including medications, attempting to empower treatment,"" Wolfgang said. She wasn't accused of a murder or even criminal carelessness (by implication causing somebody's passing). As per the First Assistant District Attorney Jason MacBride, under state law, demonstrating an immediate connection between somebody who overdoses and the merchant isn't simple. Actually, conveyance of a controlled substance warrants a more serious discipline than a criminally careless charge. Conveyance is around a nine-year sentence.- happened 6 months ago",,3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNVZW3V4,0.0

We had a huge turnout with more than 150 people coming.  All 12 of her children, their spouses and their children were able to be there!  We rented the ballroom and had the party catered with an amazing array of foods.  There were so many people I hadn't seen in such a long time there.  My favorite part was when all of her grandchildren got together and performed a musical that they had been working on for 2 months.  They were amazing!  It was filmed and I know it's just going to be a huge hit on the internet.  We all made plans to get together 6 months from now.  We'll have to find a local park that will be able to accommodate all of us, lol.  It was such a wonderful day and I'm so happy I got to be a part of it.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NT3FW9S,0.0

I finally am starting to feel better about myself and look better too. I still struggle with wanting food even when I'm not hungry, especially sweets, which are my downfall. I only allow myself a treat every now and then, just enough so I don't fall back into over-indulging. It feels so much better to not be as overweight as I had become.  I no longer feel short of breath just walking a short ways and I can exercise and feel good afterwards.  It has been extremely hard to stay on track, but I'm thankful for the people around me who love me and held me accountable and continue to do so, to keep me from putting the pounds back on.  That is what I am focused on now, staying on the right track. I am working to continue to eat healthier and to exercise or do some kind of physical activity each day. Staying active and eating food I enjoy that is healthy helps me stay on track. I'm grateful for friends who know I work hard to stay on track eating healthy and make sure they always remember that when we are out or spending time together. It would be even harder if those sweets and unhealthy foods were around all the time! I'm going to keep working hard and stay focused on being healthy for myself and my loved ones. I enjoy how I look now and don't want to go back to before, so that is huge motivation! I feel more comfortable now spending time outside. I also feel so much better about myself and I'm able to go out and enjoy and have fun without feeling so self-conscious about my body. That is such a big thing and I'm glad I've been able to keep at it and feel so much better about myself.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NRELW9I,0.0

I was in the kitchen cooking, so he came in and after saying hello, he said that he could take it from there and that I should go and put my feet up for a few minutes. for a moment I felt loved, I went off happily. no sooner had I laid my head down than i heard a message come in through his phone. I was curious. I decided to read the message. what I found left me in shock. my husband was seeing another woman, he even had a child with this woman. This caught me off guard. I was disappointed and annoyed. he could not deny it. so I just ended the relationship and decided to ask for a divorce.",3FUI0JHJPYK7GSTZ5NZR5NV4UGZ33V,3FUI0JHJPYK7GSTZ5NZR5NV4UGZ33V,0.0

This has been all she talked about for years. She's always had dreams of this. We had lived in a small broken down home in the projects all my life. My mom raised us to go after dreams and to do better than she had done. We never took that as just lip service since she was always telling us that but also showed us how to go above our situations. When I was 16, my mom went and got herself a small job in a factory. She needed the money and we took care of the home while she worked. For years, she slowly moved up from being on the ""belt"" to being in HR. She loved what she did and felt accomplished no matter what she was doing. Being able to take pride in any job she had was a lesson that by seeing her work, was something that she taught us. I didn't know that she had been saving for home. On the day her last child moved out, she told us that she had been saving money and wanted us to have it. She selflessly worked to make money to help us. We had all found good work and got out of the projects, we told her to get her dream home with it. She refused. We took the money and ended up coming together and finding her the perfect home. She had done so much for us, we wanted to do something for her. We even furnished the home for her. When we surprised her with it, she cried and begged us to not do this and to take the home back. It took some convincing but she ended up moving into the home. She's been loving it ever since.",,3FTOP5WARGAMKEWRPL9VJWEMN18J0Z,0.0

Then we found a realtor who asked us a lot of questions about what we were looking for.  We looked at a lot of houses online and in person.   Then we finally found a house that we really liked. We decided to put an offer in on it. At that point all we could do was wait. It was a stressful few days waiting to find out. Then we got the call that our offer had been accepted!! We were so excited. Even at this point there were so many steps to go through. Getting the mortgage company all of the paper work was a huge process. Then we barely ended up closing by the time we had to be out of our rental. Finally it was time to sign the closing paperwork. And then 2 days later we were able to pick up the keys and go to our new house!!! We were homeowners!",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531F7R3KGA,,0.0

During college days, we used to hang out as  a friends, attending classes together, having lunch break and sometime even dropping and picking me up from Home to College and college to home. Day in, Day out we used to see each other , spent time together, talk and share things about our life, but when the cupid striked him, I had no idea. One day when we were in cafeteria, he proposed me. He said that he fall in love the first time he saw me and from their on, he decided that he will marry me, and no one else. It was a love at first sight for him, but it wasn't for me. I couldn't think beyond friendship, because my parents will never approve of him, since he is from different religion. I could not say ""yes"" because i was not sure. I walked away from cafeteria and went straight home. I thought a lot the whole day. And the next day i decided to end this friendship, so i told him the truth. He went completely crazy denying my rejection to marry him. I got scared and started to stay far away from him. He was heart broken and disappointed. He tried to talking to me and calling me at home, but i ignored him. So later, he decided to contact my best friend and his boyfriends, since we hanged out together few times. He convinced them and then they try to convince me that he really loves me a lot and he wants to marry me but then i told them it's not possible, due to our differences, my parents will never accept him. Then they said, if he doesn't marry me, he will die and they confronted me and i refused to listen to them. Then my friend told me that i am lucky that i have someone, who loves me so dearly and deeply, wish  i had that. Her comment made me think and then i decided to talk to him. I also bought this in front of my parents and they clearly said no. After all this chaotic situation, i finally decided to marry him, but without my parents consent. They got very angry and broke all the ties with me.  Even today they are not willing to accept me and my  marriage with a guy from different religion.",3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FA9BKGL,,0.0

We've adapted so easily, so readily, to this broken boundary of time and concentration. There's such a catastrophic downside to this concept that has taken over us. It is hard to believe that we bought into this concept so easily. But, we have. We now lack the ability to concentrate for a long duration; we're constantly dividing our time between ourselves, our needs, and others. We live a fragmented life. This realization came to me when I was listening to Radiohead. I was a bit disheartened when I came to this realization. I have however, vowed to commit myself to strengthening my concentration, and having more respect for my time. I have vowed not to spend my time according to others. I have vowed to use time accordingly. There will be exceptions to what I'm trying to accomplish, but I hope to live more according to how I have vowed to set out to live.  I only get to live this life once, so I must press forward in what is best for me. Time is of the essence, so I must be wise about my time and concentration.",,3G5F9DBFOQJ6M92H4IUZSCOXE1AVHT,0.0

It's hard not only physically, with having to sort and pack and sell your things. It's hard emotionally too - leaving behind family and friends. I left behind all of my family and most of my friends - minus a few that live in Colorado already. It was sad to drive away but I was glad to have my dad with me. We saw a lot of interesting sights on our travels, including a family of moose. They were tall and elegant and beautiful but also scary to watch from the road. One of the highlights of the trip was the food we got to eat. I made sure to have a lot of BBQ and Cajun before we left Louisiana. I would not be able to have it again until I came back for Christmas in a few months. My dad and I enjoyed the time to relax from the road and also eat good food together. We ate a lot and then would be super full getting back into the car for the long drive ahead. One of the worst things that happened on our trip was a flat tire that happened in Texas. We were far away from other people and had to wait hours for triple A to come and help us fix it. Even though it was November it was luckily not too cold and we didn't freeze while we waited. I was very glad to have my dad as company or I would have been terrified waiting in the car in the middle of nowhere for that long. It was sad when my dad had to leave to go back home. I was alone in my new apartment and still had a lot of work left to do. I was scared to start my new job. But I knew that I could handle it and my new adventure.",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531F7R5GK8,0.0

Almost a year ago, my grandma suffered a couple of stroked that put her in the hospital for a while, and moving around different nursing facilities. She was 88 when this happened, she actually was able to go home, for a bit, after the initial stroke but suffered another mild stroke that put her back in nursing homes. She was a strong woman and kept holding on. However, the stroke caused her to start losing her mind a bit and when we would go visit her in the nursing homes, she would have a little bit of clarity but most of the time she was calling out for help and she would pray, especially the Rosary, over and over again 24/7. The nurses always joked that she was going straight to heaven because she prayed so much. We even had a Priest come out a few times to give her last rites but she still held on. My grandma eventually passed away this past April 2019. My cousins, Aunt and I were there when she passed, it was very peaceful. We would watch her as she struggled to breath but was unconscious (probably could hear us still).  We were there for a couple of hours, talking and even joking around and crying in between because our grandma had been with us for so long, it was hard to believe she was dying. My grandma was so strong, she survived losing a baby, husband, her youngest daughter and granddaughter at early ages, she had been through so much. We finally noticed she didn't seem to be breathing anymore and was becoming cold to the touch and we called in the nurse to confirm she had passed and she did. It was very peaceful but, it's weird, I noticed how fast her body became stiff when they took off her mask and covered her up. It was such an emotional moment but, surprisingly, I didn't find myself crying that much. Some 10 years prior I had witnessed my mother pass away from cancer and gone through my younger sister's car accident that killed her, so I thought to myself, ""maybe I'm just done crying."" Regardless of me crying or not, it was such a stressful and emotional situation. There was a sense of peace and relief that it was over because my grandma had suffered so much while in the nursing homes because her mind was going and my family and I were going in to see her almost everyday, so to see her at peace was a relief. However, there was a huge sense of loss because she was so prominent in our lives, it was weird that she would no longer be a part of our lives now. Witnessing the last breath of my grandma was a very sobering moment.",3GD6L00D3TJCSBNUO1QNDTPDPKGM13,3GD6L00D3TJCSBNUO1QNDTPDPKGM13,0.0

It was very scary and exciting all at the same time. I knew I would have a transplant for a long time, as the kidney disease I had was the result of Lupus. When my kidney failure reached end-stage, I went into treatment that kept my kidney function at a certain level. It was a level that was low enough to allow you to be considered for a transplant, but not emergency-level yet. Doctors said if I could stay at that level of function, I could still live many years without needing a transplant or dialysis. After a couple of years, I started getting kidney stones and sometimes they needed surgery. They started to harm what was left of my kidney function, so I got my transplant.  The day of the transplant, I went with my husband. We had to be at the hospital very early and we left the house at 4 am. We aren't morning people and we were both nervous but there wasn't anything to really say. So we sat in relative silence for a while in the hospital room. It was about 3 hours util I went into the surgery theater. As they were wheeling me in, I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen after all the time I spent learning and worrying about it. I was very scared but I had to meet so many people and answer so many questions that it kept my mind occupied. I remember shaking with nerves while I talked to the anesthesiologist. That was the most scared I got, but it was the last thing before they started giving me medication. I don't really remember much after our conversation, until I woke up in recovery. I asked for my husband right away and I was so releived and happy. He was right there waiting so from then on he was by my side.  Once I got into my room, he stayed with me until it was late at night. After that first day I could only see him every afternoon because we lived two hours away from the hospital and he also had to keep working. I was so happy to go home after 10 days.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T,0.0

The competition was running hot and cold among the normally tight group. Everything was ready to go.  I was at the top of the ladder trying to fasten hardware and I couldn't reach the roof!  So now I have to wait for Missy to come home from work. When she does I will ask if her husband is available to carry their heavy ladder over.  They could easily sabotage my entry.  I hope they are ""available"".  I hope they do not delay.  I can't get the decorations up in time before the deadline if they play games.  Thank goodness our neighborhood is not mean spirited.

I hadn't heard from him for about six months, ever since he lost at Monopoly during game night. I mean, I guess I should have realized that playing Monopoly could lead to hurt feelings, but I didn't think it would strain our friendship so badly. He was mad that I bought a lot of cheap properties and filled them up with houses, leaving no houses for the rest of the players to use. I just thought it was good strategy, but he threw the dice across the room and stormed out. Ever since, hardly anyone will come to game night anymore. James said he was sorry for overreacting. I was still a little mad that everyone took his side, but after thinking about it for a little while, I told him I was sorry he didn't have a good time. I also promised never to bring out Monopoly at a game night again. I think we're OK now. He's planning a big game night at his place on Friday so that everyone can see that we're friends again. He says that everything will be great. I guess I will go. I just hope that he doesn't pull out Risk. I don't think our friendship would survive that.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLAT88M8,0.0

I care a lot about that friend and have been friends with her for over 20 years. I don't want anything like that to ever happen between us again. Things still aren't back to normal between us and I really want them to go back the way that they used to be. I don't know if she wants them to or not. We are both really in different areas in our lives right now and have drifted apart. I still care so much about her and always have and always will. I just really want my friend back the way things used to be. I hope and pray some day that they will be the way that they used to be. I've tried calling her and she didn't answer but she will respond to a text message. She will text me at times also. I'm not going to give up on her.,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLAT88M8,,0.0

We hadn't gotten together in a very long time.  The trip up was very scenic and beautiful.  I drove up with my sister.  When we arrived everyone else was already there.  My sister in law had a beautiful table set with meats, cheeses and wine.  It was surprising to me that we all seemed to pick up where we left off, so to speak.  We hadn't seen each other in a long time and it felt like yesterday.   I was shocked to see how my brother's two sons had grown so much!  They are now mature young, handsome men with great personalities.  What a joy they were to interact with!  We had planned to go on a little trip to do some wine tasting, so we did that.  We had to take two cars.  The city we went to was Woodinville.  It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, the reviews were terribly wrong!  The food was horrible and the service worse.  Oh well, we made the best of it.  My sister and I spent the night and left early in the morning.  It was a memorable time for all of us.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L5I2W5R,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L5I2W5R,0.0

Since that event, I was telling about him to all the players I had a chance to talk to. All the people I was speaking with said they are not surprised. Albert is acting like that not only to me. Every time he looses, he always has some excuse. Floor is to slippery. Light is terrible in this place. I didn't get a chance to warm up ! This ball is not a three star ball ! The opponent's serve was not a legal serve ! ...and many many other ridiculous excuses - because there is no other way to call these. I find a behavior like that pathetic...  when You loose - You loose. Shake the other player's hand, smile and thank him for the game and don't be a baby... nobody likes people like that.Anyway - Albert and myself - we've met again. It was not a tournament, just a regular league, but if he would loose, he would still loose rating points. I saw him not coming to the table when it was our turn to play. I went to him and I told him we should play now. He answered - no. Just ""no"". He gave no explanation, like... I'll play You later, or I'm not playing with You, or ANYTHING. He just said ""no"" like a retarder baby and not a grown up man that he is. I told him then - I'll let You warm up for as long as You want, c'mon, let's play. I just got another ""no"". I find that really disrespectful and I said to him that he is a coward. Nothing - no reaction, no nothing. I mean, if someone is calling You a coward, You want to explain some things with him right ? Naah, I got nothing from Albert...  This tells us what kind of a man he is. This was his chance for a rematch and getting his points back, but he acted like a child again.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L4ES5WH,,0.0

It was a rainy day, but I felt great still. My family and my girlfriend's family came to town for our graduation. I felt okay, but my girlfriend was very nervous. We put our gowns on, and went to the auditorium for graduation. We sat down in our section, and talked a bit with the people around us. I remember a few construction majors I took classes with sitting ahead of me, wearing hard hats. They were asked to remove them, unfortunately. Graduation started from the front, with the school of medicine. There was a famous speaker, a comedian, and he was clearly drunk. I saw a few people I knew from high school, and started feeling a bit nervous. As our turn was approaching, we tried to calm down and prepare. Once it was my turn, I felt fine. I walked across the stage, accepted my diploma, and returned to my seat. Graduation concluded, and we were very happy.

After spending some time relaxing in our suite, we went to dinner. We had dinner at a highly-rated local barbecue restaurant that happens to be one of my favorites. I had a smoked brisket sandwich with french fries. My girlfriend had smoked chicken. The dinner was delicious, as usual, and we enjoyed our dining experience very much. My girlfriend surprised me again with tickets to a play at a local theater. The play was very good. We returned to our suite after the play concluded.

We have many people who write to us to either share their own experiences surrounding this mystery, which is known as the crystal skulls, or ask us questions.  About six months ago, a friend who also has her own crystal skulls asked me for advice and called me.  She felt it was time to create the next public conference where people could meet the most well known crystal skull teaches and investigators in the world and I said it sounded like a good idea. I have personally been invited to speak at various crystal skull conferences over the years as well as have helped to organize a few of these. Thus, my friend decided to create such a conference near Chicago and invited me to be one of the speakers.  This conference will take place later this current month. I was very thrilled and honored to be invited as I have been involved in investigating the crystal skulls for over 35 years and I have so much amazing information and insights to share about these mysterious objects.  However, it is in my nature to offer to help create such a conference as there are keys aspects  I have learned about how to incorporate in such an event that could enhance the experience of the attendees.  So the memorable event to  be shared in this essay is the phone call I had with my friend, who became the conference coordinator who rejected my participation to help and desired to do it on her own.  She explained that for her, in her past when she has worked with a group, things have not worked out well and wanted to make sure that the visions she had for the conference would be created.  This was of course a great disappointment for me and it took away my enthusiasm to be a part of the conference.  Over the months as the conference was being announced publicly I would offer to help and share it with others we know via emails and social media but in my heart, I knew this event would miss some key activities to really share about the crystal skulls.  I will just have to wait my time in the future, when we can put together the proper resources to create our own event which I believe will delight all those who attended and expand their knowledge about this mysterious objects.  For now, when the conference happens I will do the most memorable talk I can do as well as share with those who attend the special crystal skulls we personally have.",3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PQ0EGD4,3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PQ0EGD4,0.0

Studying architecture was definitely harder than i had thought. So much calculations. Units. The artistic element seems to be missing in our colleges these days. However, i was thrilled after graduation. I applied to all the major firms in the state for an opening position. No responses for a few months. I was getting downhearted. However, to my greatest surprise, the email from the top architecture agency of the state was waiting for me on my birthday weekend. Best birthday gift ever!

Well, 5 months ago, I had a baby boy! I distinctly remember the anticipation of his birth, it was a testy time for me for sure. My wife was under a lot of physical and mental stress, and I was eagerly waiting for labor day, but I was fearful yet excited. It's a feeling I'm not sure if I will feel again, especially when my wife went into labor. I didn't know what was going on -- it felt like adrenaline running through my veins and I felt frantic but also that I knew exactly what I was doing and what needed to be done. I was there to support my wife at all steps and I wished most in the world for the healthy birth of my son and that my wife would be alright. When he was finally born, I remember making a look of shock and awe to my wife, especially when she handed him to me to hold. It was crazy to think that my own son was in my hands, and only a few months back I never had any time of feelings like this. I was almost overwhelmed, but my wife and I always wanted a family, and this had been years in the making. Honestly, some of my first thoughts were, ""Can I do this? Am I going to be a capable father?"". My wife helped me put those thoughts to rest quick, and the joy of having my son around drowned out those types of thoughts quickly when my family and my wife's family showed up to support us, as well as our friends. The amount of support was really incredible. I don't think we had to buy a thing for 3 months as people came in in droves to support us it seemed. I'm a family man now,  and I love it.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB5OYAPT,0.0

My wife and I were riding my Harley Davidson motorcycle in a nearby town, on a cool Sunday Afternoon. We were in a town not far from where we live, but I am not completely familiar with the streets there. As we came around a bend, a red light prompted us to stop. The street was not asphalt, but more of a concrete, very susceptible to potholes. As we leaned into the corner, my front tire slid into a deep long groove. This caused the weight of my bike to shift, throwing us off balance and nearly wiping us out. The road was quite busy behind us. I feared dropping my motorcycle, but at such a low speed, I was much more concerned with the traffic behind us. It was truly a frightening experience. We were both terrified, left shaken by the near-miss. Luckily, I was able to place my foot down on the pavement, which saved us from going over entirely. It all happened so quickly, and I am not the most experienced rider. I can still feel the uneasiness in my chest anytime I take off to ride. This is especially true whenever my wife joins me. I've become much more aware of my surroundings as a result. I also spend much more time scanning the area in front of me while I ride.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB3VWAP3,0.0

It was my first time experiencing that kind of graduation. I was surprised by how different military culture is from every day life. Something I specifically remember from the event was during the ceremony we had to stand and sit down at specific times. I was surprised by how precise everything was. I also was surprised by how different my brother seemed after he graduated. He was more mature and I could tell the experience changed him a lot. I was really proud of him for this achievement.

Most years the vacation is a real grind. We have been going to the same place for twenty years with the exception of two years. The truth is for a couple of years I have been trying to back out of it and do something on my own with my vacation time but my mom can do one hell of a passive aggressive guilt trip to get me to go. My parent will ask me and my siblings what we want to do new this year at the destination but the truth is as far as activities go we've gone scorched earth over this place. Anyway, My dad and older sister normally have the trip scheduled down to the minute, leaving no room for anybody else to have much input. I am a little ashamed to admit for the past few years I've spent most of my time in varying degrees of drunken stupor as my main form of entertainment.  I had thought this might be the year that the cycle would break but my sister, who definitely drives the engine in this scenario, came up with a scenario to take my brother's children along this year. I have to admit, this was not her worst idea. My brother had moved to a different city and these children had never been to the destination before and would definitely shake up the routine. So, that was what happened a couple of month's ago my brother brought his children to town and we packed them into the cars a few days later for the trip. The car ride down was mostly unmemorable except for the fact that I realized that my spotify  playlists were not really kid friendly. The trip itself was a lot of the same things as before but there was a new energy because it was it was new to the children and it was exciting for them to go someplace that they had never been before. Things that had been stale were given new life and people were forced to change up some of their routines. Doing things that had become pedestrian and had lost their luster became fun again as I watched my nieces do them and remembered how I used to love to do these things when I was younger. For some reason I was dominating games that required coordination. Actually, one of the biggest problems was as the week progressed was that time was becoming compressed and there was so much to do. These kids had heard about the different things, those of us who had been coming for years had done, and wanted to do it all. Our last night there we were doing things until one in the morning. The next morning when we left was the first time in a couple years I had felt the least bit sad to be leaving. It was a long drive home I think most people were a little frayed but it had been a good trip.",,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHMHLPBQ,0.0

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session. That I don't need to hold onto those any longer. I can let them go. They no longer have the power to affect me. Easily the most memorable experience that I've had this year.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6FQGWQ,0.0

It took me a lot of planning and lying to my best friend to pull off this party. At the end of the day the party was a huge success and my girlfriend said YES. It was an amazing day. I will never forget the look at the face when she found out what was going on. I'm a maid of honor in her wedding next summer. I hope that the wedding will be as amazing as her engagement. Fingers crossed.,3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HQWMREK,,0.0

It was an arduous journey to get there and I was short on funds so I decided not to walk. It also seemed silly to celebrate an organization that demonstrated time and time again that it didn't care about me or my peers. Let's be honest with ourselves, university functions are rarely about the students themselves and their accomplishments. That said, I somewhat regret not walking because a few of my peers did. We were a class of 9 and about half of us chose to attend the graduation ceremony. My peers were what made graduate school worthwhile. They helped me learn and supported me like no other. While, yes, I had a few professors who taught me a great deal about my particular concentration, the overall impression that I was left with by the faculty was that I was labelled as a lost cause (and too fat to be taken seriously... but that's a different story). For as much as my family insisted that this was an accomplishment, it didn't feel that way. It felt more like a significant waste of my time, energy, and capital. It has been hard to fully process all of my feelings about graduating. I wish I felt proud, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find that I  mostly felt lost, worthless, and full of resentment. That may have been the primary motivator for not wanting to participate outside of not being able to spare the expense. I hope I can one day reflect more positively on my graduation, but right now I'm struggling with this less than stellar emotional quagmire.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6C8GW2,0.0

After doing some research and getting recommendations from friends I called the highest rated therapist I could find. I was very nervous about this experience because I have never been able to share how I truly feel with anyone. I always worry about them judging me and no one in my life has really truly understood. I have had a lot of hardships as a child and I don't want to share all of them with people I have to see on a day to day basis. Finally the day came and I had my first therapist appointment. As I walked up the steps to the therapists office I was deep in thought. Was this the right choice? I was so nervous. I slowly began to climb the stairs. On the third step my deep concentration on the talk to come distracted me from my climb and I fell backward down the stairs and hit my head. Pain burst through my scalp and my head immediately began throbbing. I reached to the back of my head and felt wetness. I yelled for help. The therapist came running out of her office and called 911. I was rushed to the emergency room and diagnosed with a minor concussion and got 3 stitches for the cut in my head. So much for my first therapy visit. After a week of rest and recovery I once again returned to my therapists office and this time I carefully used the railing as I climbed the stairs. Today I safely made it in to the office for my first official appointment. The first appointment went ok. I was a little nervous but the therapist was kind and I decided to come back twice a week at her suggestion. Since that day I have been seeing her twice a week and I have been able to share many difficult feelings. The more I see her the more I trust her and the more I am able to share about my experiences. Sometimes details that I have not thought about in many years come to me between visits so it is very useful to be able to return later in the week to discuss again. My therapist has become an amazing support in my life and I will never forget my first therapeutic experiences.,,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6FQGWQ,0.0

About 4 months ago I took the ultimate plunge. One of the bravest things a man can do. I married the love of my life. I can still remember it so clearly. How I woke up 3 hours early from nerves, as if I slept at all. The bed felt empty without her but she does love her tradition. I got out of bed nervous and excited the two emotions wrestling around in my brain. I hopped in the shower and scrubbed up imagining how beautiful my future wife would be walking down the aisle in her dress. After my shower I carefully pulled out the fancy tux she insisted on picking herself and put myself together pulling the stiff clothes over my body. My family had stayed the night in the cabin rental with me along with some college buddies and were waiting for me downstairs. My fiance had her dream wedding planned since childhood and she always wanted to be married next to a roaring waterfall! One as powerful as the love she would have to have to commit herself to one man forever. We all piled into the rental car and started to head towards Abaloosha falls. To my dismay raindrops started to hit the windshield of our car. I felt my stomach drop. How could it be raining today of all days the most important of our lives. I begged whatever entity out there to please cut it out just for a little while, but it continued. I thought about my bride and if she was upset. We drove for about 45 minutes or so and to my extreme delight rays of sun started to peek through the clouds and the rain began to stop. We ended up getting to have our dream wedding with the sun shining through the water and my now wifes beauty shining over me. I thank everyday for her. I cant wait to live the rest of my life with this woman.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,0.0

We both had wanted a small private wedding.  Something that was not expensive.  I knew that my wife had a fascination about waterfalls.  I had taken her to see several waterfalls since we had began dating, all of which she thoroughly enjoyed.  I therefore decided to book our wedding in Gatlinburg, Tennessee by a small waterfall.  I booked the date and had everything set up.  It was just going to be my wife, the preacher, a photographer, and myself.  The whole experience did not cost much at all.  When you plan an outdoor activity in advance, you risk facing adverse weather.  As the wedding day approached I kept looking at the weather report and was worried as it had a very high chance of raining that day.  On the day of our wedding, I woke up to the sound of pouring rain.  I looked outside, and it was indeed raining and cloudy as far as I could see.  I was smart enough to have made alternate arrangements just in case, but I knew my wife was really wanting the wedding to be by the waterfall.  The wedding wasn't scheduled until 2 pm.  My now wife and I began to get dressed and ready for the wedding with both of us hoping the weather would magically change.  I heard it stop raining around 1 pm.  I quickly looked outside and I saw a blue patch in the sky, but I also saw plenty of dark clouds right behind it.  MY wife and I headed to where the ceremony was going to be, all the while both of us praying that the rain would hold up just long enough.  To our surprise, it still was not raining again once we got to the waterfall.  We were excited and blessed.  We had a 10 minute, beautiful intimate wedding but the waterfall where rays of sunshine were beaming on us.  Fifteen minutes after we got married, it once again began to downpour.  We were amazed and blessed by our luck in the weather.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,,0.0

It wasn't her who took care of me, so why should I return the favor to someone who was so unwanting of me?

My mother and I haven't been seeing eye to eye on things and often times, we end up fighting. I had moved out about 6 months ago when an apartment opened up. My mom was furious about me leaving but then got so mad about it that she stopped talking to me. My now girlfriend lives next door to me in the apartment complex. When I had moved in, we spent a lot of time talking as she was helping me get settled into the place. I had told her about my mother being the way she is. Her mom was the same way and we bonded over that. A about 2 months ago, my mom started calling me again. She was begging me to come home since she had ran out of money. I couldn't believe that she searched me out just because she needed money! I talked to my girlfriend about it and she told me that you know, sometimes it's hard to just let your parents deal with what they are dealing with. I still wasn't sure about it. I knew that I was happier away from her. My girlfriend told me that I have to choose what is right for me. I ended up telling my mom I was sorry and I hope that she figured things out.

I was excited and nervous because it seemed like we were spending a lot of money to buy materials and hire a contractor.  There are many parts of our home that need work but we decided on the master bathroom.  I had picked out a contractor who had done a small job for me 2 years ago but I really didn't know him well.  He didn't give me much guidance about what I needed to do to prepare for the project so all I did was pick out some tile for the wall.  I think he assumed that I knew more than I know (I tend to fool people like this sometimes :) ) so I felt kind of stupid when he was asking me questions.  It turned out that he had similar taste in terms of design and he was able to give me some great advice.  He and his helper were easy to be around and I feel like I made a new friend.  The bathroom is beautiful but this isn't where the story ends.  Meeting him kind of flipped my  world on its axis.  I found myself energized to not only see the house differently but to look at myself differently.  It's like I woke up from a funk and have started paying attention to myself and my surroundings.  I painted the front of the house and replaced the house numbers.  I bought some plants to add some color.  I renewed my  gym membership and started going regularly.  I polish my nails now!  Maybe I was depressed, I don't know.  I'm not manic now, I still love to watch TV and go online but I feel like I can do anything I set my mind to.",3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM00UPLO,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM00UPLO,0.0

It has been a whirlwind year with many changes, however today was by far the biggest change.  I woke up this morning in in the queen size bed of the hotel room my fiance and I stayed in while in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  Excitement, nervousness, and joy were racing through my veins as I crawled out of bed and looked at my fiance sleeping in the queen sized bed beside mine.  I quickly got up and ready for the historic day.  I located my phone to check the weather hoping that it had magically changed from the previous day.  As I looked down at what my phone said, I let out a soft curse word out of frustration.  It was still calling for a 60% chance of rain.  My fiance woke up asking what was wrong.  I told her, and she said it was okay.  We had made alternate plans just in case this were to happen.  My fiance got out of bed and kissed me.  She proceeded to calmly get ready for the day as I continued pacing nervously.  It stopped raining about 30 minutes before it was time for us to leave.  I looked at my fiance with hopeful eyes praying that the rain would hold for a couple of hours.  We hopped into my car and began driving towards our destination.  As we got closer to our destination I could begin to see a patch of blue sky begin to form from the surrounding gray spots.  We finally arrived at the waterfall, and the preacher was there waiting for us.  My fiance's eyes lit up at the site.  She had always wanted to be married by a waterfall.  It was a short ceremony but one that would forever change our lives.  Today was the day that I married the love of my life.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,0.0

This, unfortunately, has led to me experiencing relatively frequent panic attacks. A few weeks ago I had what I would call my most costly panic attack ever. I had been feeling under the weather around that time and it didn't seem like I was getting any better. I had already been to the doctor twice in two weeks, but the doctor told me that all of the tests came back negative for any of the likely causes. He said that it was likely just a cold that has been aggravated by stress and that it would resolve itself with time. I woke up one morning and felt worse than I have ever felt. This caused me to get my self very wound up and have another panic attack. Once I was able to gather myself, I drove myself to the emergency room. The doctor there conducted all of the basic tests and still nothing was out of the ordinary. Being panicked, I  insisted that something was wrong and asked if there were any other tests that they could run. The doctor said yes, but also informed me that my insurance would likely not cover the costs of the additional tests. Being so anxious and upset, I agreed to still have the tests, even though my savings weren't anything special. So they ran a few additional tests and everything still came back negative. I eventually was convinced to go home and once again, wait and see if things got better. Of course, within a few days I was feeling as good as new. I was incredibly relieved until I received my medical bills. It would wipe out all of my savings and force me to use a payment plan to cover all of my expenses.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM9UFPL6,0.0

The only exception is a parent or guardian buying a car for their child. This means that I am driving a car I do not even own. This dealership has royally screwed with my finances. They are charging me 21% interest on this car. They finance was for right at sixteen thousand and I will end up paying over forty two thousand for this car. I am appalled that someone could do this and still sleep soundly at night. Now I have to refinance this car with either my sister in law or my mother with my name so that I can eventually just have my name on the car. Some companies have found sympathy with my situation and are willing to work on a better interest rate with me. I am at least thankful for the fact that I have a car at all.",3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYNPLC,,0.0

It was totally unexpected on my side, which is probably part of the reason it has hit me so badly. We had been together for about 9 months and it was long distance, but there was never really issue with jealousy or trust. I knew he had female friends, and he knew I had male friends, and it was never an issue. He is in Indonesia, and I am in America, so we talked through WhatsApp but our timezones often left us asleep/awake at opposite times and we only had a few hours each day to talk. We spoke through voicechat, videochat, and text messages. One morning about 3 weeks ago now, I woke up to a text message written in a different style than he writes that said something like ""I already have a girlfriend, don't talk to me again. Goodbye."" I was obviously very surprised and confused and I asked him to explain and he said a female friend of his had taken his phone and written that because she was jealous. I said that was very strange and obviously she wanted to date him and he said no, they were just friends and she was being mean. I accepted that and moved on, but then about a week later it happened again, but this time when I told him about the messages he said that she had gotten jealous and confessed that she had feelings for him, and he felt the same, so he wanted to be with her and he and I would just be friends. It was shocking for many reasons because I had believed him when it happened the first time and told him she wanted to date him; he had known her for a long time, so why now; and I found it hard to understand how he would leave me for someone who was purposely trying to hurt me with the way she pretended to be him and say mean things to me. He wanted to stay friends, and I tried, but she began to control his life, and continued to say mean things to me while pretending to be him, blocked me on his phone, and got angry with him for playing a game with me on his phone. I feel like he's in an abusive relationship, and I know real life is easier than long distance, but I still am struggling with heartbreak and pain, and I've even caught a cold. I don't understand why he would leave me for her. We never fought, and it seems like he fights with her everyday. We occasionally speak through the game, but I got my hopes up the other day, so now I'm trying to keep a distance. It's really hard and sad and I love him.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMYBQLP0,0.0

Overall i was happy for it because well it was something fun? who would not enjoy something that is a fun and good time out with people.  i was looking forward to this since then and planned many since then. As nights out are not something that can be done daily. As fun as that could be but overall it is a highlight for me. Like so many things can be mundane. And not be what you really want them to be when you go out. its good that something at least is what it should be nothing more nothing less. Which since the time of the event i have done it a couple more times. And i plan to go again somewhere else again as drinking and kicking the bucket with friends with a band playing awesome music. Is some of the best moments i have had though that night was in paticular better. Because the bands that played killed it so hard. They were heavy hard and just ripped through their sets. Plus their were so many of them which was a good turn around.,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,,0.0

I am currently on Medicaid. All mental health providers have stopped taking medicaid patients for reasons that they will not disclose. I have had to pay out of pocket. My mental health provider who diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. It has been a constant fight to maintain some sense of normalcy enough to balance the responsibilities in my life.

She was there for 18 days. I stayed with here the entire time, she was contagious so I could not leave. It was during this time that I had what I think of as an awakening. There was not much to do and I knew that I had to do something to keep myself strong. I started to exercise. Gradually I began to move. I did consider stopping but I pushed through and each day began to feel better. I also did word puzzles and had a book to read to try and stay mentally sharp. I helped my Mom with her exercises and we had long conversations. But all the while I exercised. While I was just sitting in a chair watching TV, while she was sleeping in the afternoon, I fit it in everywhere. By the time she was released I felt like a new person.

An aunt thought that I didn't answer the door on purpose when she came over. It was years ago, but still very upsetting as it was a close relative.  I didn't think they would ever think I would do something like that. I believe she knew I didn't do what she accused me of as it was very stupid and meaningless. I just don't think she ever thought she could say she was wrong or sorry. I believe she got mixed up, went to the wrong apartment or was just simply mistaken. I'm the type that would have answered the door, but explained there were other things I needed to do. I certainly wouldn't have just not opened the door. Everyone in my family mentioned that to her. She was very stubborn and always thought she was a bit better than everyone else morally.  I did apologize just because my mother asked me to. It was easier to do that than let my mom be upset. But, it was never the same with us. When I would see her at holidays or other family occasions, I always felt resentful. I am one of the most responsible people in my family and took it to heart.

The course we chose to play was about 30 minutes from my house, and we took two or three cars to get there. Within the first 30 minutes after we arrived, on the first or second hole, I received a text message from my sister stating that my dad was being taken to the hospital by ambulance with what was thought to be a heart issue. I continued to play, while waiting for further updates. Around the fourth or fifth hole, my wife called to make sure that I had heard the news. I told her that I had, but I didn't know any more information. Since I had ridden with other guys, I struggled with what to do. If I was at a course near my house, I would've just stopped playing. My parents live about an hour away from my house. If I chose to leave, that meant that I would need to convince two or three other guys to stop playing as well. I decided to stay at the course, and wait for further updates. About halfway through the day, I received word that he had been admitted to the hospital for observation. I let my mom know the situation, and that I would be there as soon as I could. She understood my dilemma. When I got returned home, I immediately left for the hospital, and was able to hang around until he was released from the hospital the next day.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1OCMO9Y,,0.0

Even if I wasn't found out, I would know forever what I did to earn my grade.  I pride myself on having integrity, and this was a black mark on my soul.

When I am feeling good about myself, this memory keeps leaking back into my thoughts.  It won't let me fully rest and be at peace.  I'm not sure what to do to erase the negativity.  Maybe mentor someone who needs help passing a college course.  I'm thinking of signing up to volunteer and give some time back for free.  I think this will help me clear my conscience.  If nothing else, that project has taught me not to procrastinate anymore.  I get started on deadlines right away for fear of doing less than superior work.  So at least my work ethic has improved.

I've never been really close to my family besides my grandmother and she passed away 9 years ago. What hurts the most with my aunt passing is that I did not make a way to go and see her and now she is gone. We would talk briefly and she would express her want to come and visit and me being a hermit I chose to never partake in any visit thus I never got to see her. We held a memorial service for her Saturday and things just did not seem right one minute she was here and the next she was gone. I never got to tell her I love her or how much fun we had together or even thank you for the times she let me and my daughter stay and we could've been homeless. Me and my aunt ann was a lot closer than me and my other aunties and I now have to live with the fact she is gone and I have so much to say and it's too late to say it. Now I feel alone my grandma and aunt always had my back  more than my mother she has always made a difference in her kids I've never felt love and now I feel like I won't feel love ever given my aunt Is gone. I have always cherished family and my auntie did too now many of the things we did as a family won't happen because she is gone. I can't even imagine how my cousin feel about this I know what I feel about it and have yet to accept the truth. I want to go into a bubble and never come out after this event it is hitting my heavy. I feel soulless and helpless like I have no where to turn to. I feel like giving up on the world and letting go I just want to say forget it. Her unexpected death leaves me with too many questions that has gone unanswered. Her death makes me reflect on my own life and how to make it better.,,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1Q1H9OU,0.0

We went out and ate dinner, things seemed to be going well. I wasnt to concerned since the contractions weren't severe. I took a shower and headed to bed, I woke up around 3 a.m. with severe pain in my back. I walked it off for a little while before deciding it was time to go in to the hospital. On the way to the hospital we hit rush hour traffic and my water broke. My husband proceeded to call 911 in case we didnt make it there in time.  It seemed likeforever but we made it to labor and delivery. I was put in a wheelchair and taken right up to the delivery room. I was already dilated 7 cm. My husband called everyone but within 20 minutes our son had arrived. He was a little jaundiced but fine. He was 6pound 10 oz. He had black hair and brown eyes, he looked just like his older brother.  He cried a lot right after being born but that night he fed and slept well. We had family visit us from out of state, we face times and facebooked everyone else. His older brother wasnt to happy about the new addition but after we got home he really started warming up to him. He slept the first night at home so peacefully, he didnt wake until about 7 am for feeding. My husband stayed home for the first 2 weeks and my mother in law stayed for 2 weeks after that. He was very quiet and calm, he smiled a lot since the day he was born. He was not a difficult baby at all.  He grew really well, in fact was in the 95th percentile. He looks so much bigger even now, people think he is much older. Him and his older brother get along much better now, they are the best of friends.",3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9XDY8T,,0.0

Im feeling all kinds of emotions I have always been a daddys girl. Even at times when i didn't want to be. My earliest memory of my dad is me dancing in my room while he played the air guitar. I think I was about 4 years old. I remember thinking he was the coolest guy alive. I remember the first time he hit me for no reason i was 10. He was mad at something I cant remember what but he picked me up and threw me into the tv. I really remember feeling pain i just remember my head feeling numb almost like white noise. I cried thinking it had to be my fault I was gonna be better. But I never did get better and things got worse. My father was addicted to drugs I knew that I think it was something everybody knew. I had tried over the years to get him clean. Nothing worked i began to hate him blaming him for everything that happened bad in my life.  I looked at his body in the casket i kissed his cheek he was cold. Almost as cold as our relationship had been while i was growing up. I felt a since of loss for our relationship that could of been I felt guilt for not forgiving him.,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9SV8YB,,0.0

I struggled because of my weight and because there was no one there to help me. I had called my husband on the phone but he did not pick up. I called my mother as well,  but it made more sense for her to meet me at the hospital. My best friend lived next door and was on her way over. Once my friend got there everything seemed to go a lot easier. She put me in her car and we were on our way. The pain was intermittent but intense. I could not really believe the day had finally arrived. Where was my husband? Why hadn't he picked up? Didn't we agree to be on high alert? My friend pulled into the emergency entrance and they wheeled me into the hospital room. They told me my doctor was on her way. I couldn't find my phone. What had they done with it. It felt like I would be having this baby any second. But it was actually still a few hours away. My husband got to the hospital; so did my mom.

While there, I indicated that he was having issues breathing, that he got out of breath quickly. The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together. Now we take long walks when we want, take naps when we feel we must and enjoy an occasional pizza together.",3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,0.0

He went to the doctor for a yearly physical and did not mention this issue.  however I was in the room with him and I told the doctor that the neighbors as well as myself thought it was not normal to breath like he was. So, the doctor suggested that he have a stress test. This started the whole process..After this test we had another. This time an angiogram. The angiogram indicated there were several blockages in his arteries. His heart was not getting the oxygen it needed to be functioning properly. This took us to a heart surgeon. The surgeon admitted him immediately for open heart surgery. The stress test led to another to another test and actually ended up in surgery.

It's been two months since we opened our business in this wonderful location, and everything is going wonderfully.  But I have to keep reminding myself that it could have turned out very differently.  Every time I start to remember the horrible weeks leading up to the grand opening, I have an almost irresistible urge to go find Douglas (the hubby and other half of the business) and give him a big hug and a smacking big kiss for being such a rock through it all.  First, 4 weeks before the date, the landlord contacted us to say he thought there might be an unforeseen termite problem with the property.  Then a week later, no termites, just water damage, but might need to postpone tenancy.  Great, since our current lease at the time was due to expire and we had to get our stock and everything out of the store.  Then our movers went out of business.  Next, our suppliers  contacted us to say they were having problems with labor and shipping, and could we wait eight weeks for delivery.  The answer to that was a definite no, and I went power shopping to find new suppliers and fallback shipping.  Before I got new suppliers lined up I was tempted to just chuck it all in.  But Douglas got our friends to pitch in, we found an alternate location, new movers,new suppliers, an army of friends to help, and it actually happened.    The opening went off without a hitch, business is booming.  Life is good.  Out of disaster came the best business move we ever made.  This weekend, the best thank you party for friends!",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4AYY1B,0.0

I spent so much time without her and suffering and I am so grateful she took me back and accepted me. She didn’t have to forgive me for all the mistakes I have made but she did and it proves that we were meant to be together. Since I wrote this 3 months agO we have moved in together and started working on marriage and a baby. We get along so great now and now that the slate is wiped clean I can focus on being the man that she needs and wants. I’m t was a hard road getting her back but with time and love this can only get better. I unfortunately cheated on her a few months back and she found out about it and left me. I felt very sorry about what I did and I was amazed she still loved me after all these months. I often think back to that event and realize how stupid I was and that I should had given my girlfriend the respect she deserved and never cheated on her. I am a little bit older now and a lot more wiser and I’m just still in awe that she could forgive me like this and that makes me feel so honored that I have her in my life. The truth is I don’t know where I would be without her and I owe her so much. I often think about buying a home with her and starting a little family and I know deep down inside of my self that is what I want and I wouldn’t be happier with anyone else besides her. I would give my life to make her happy and I must learn to control my urges better and not sacrifice my happy life for a few minutes of sexual gratification. I want to be the better man that she needs and wants and I want to make myself a better man so I can properly grow and give my all to my family. I am excited to start this new chapter in my life and excited for the challenge of being a fAther and a good husband to my future wife.,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK6ZSY1L,,0.0

I am a college student so i don't get to go home a lot but when i do i like to enjoy my time there. Well about two days into my trip i got a call that i wish i had never answered. It was my uncle saying that my aunt was really sick and they did not know how long she had. My aunt had turned 90 a few days before this so her time was petty limited. Once i got to the hospital she didn't recognize me a first, but once she heard my voice she knew who it was. She was mostly blind so it was very hard for her to make out faces. I noticed that her breathing was really slow and her words were coming out so slowly. We talked for a few hours, as she reminisced on her life and her experiences. She told me about so many of the things she did in her life and all the people who she had come to know. she talked about her kids and mall my cousins and how  she was proud of all of us. She explained to me how proud of me she was in school bettering myself and she saw me being a very successful young man in the near future. I was at the home for about two hours before i saw her take her last breath. I wont lie that broke me seeing her leave this earth. I did not expect that to be her final moment. I was in tears and could not even  begin to comprehend what just happened. I started calling around to different family members and letting then know the news and that she had passed. My cousin, her son said he would be to the home in about an hour, so i decided to stay there until he came. Once he got there i consoled him and was there for him and he was there for me.",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZST0JY8P,0.0

The hospital had been pretty quiet, when all of a sudden a Condition A was called in the main lobby as I was walking through. An older man was turning blue, and had collapsed to the floor. I was terrified to respond to my first major code, particularly that I would do something wrong. A nurse was going to get the crash cart and I had to begin CPR. Thankfully, the man had a button down shirt and I was able to get to his chest quickly. He was a very large man, and I was afraid my chest compressions weren't strong enough. I can still hear the sounds of his rib cage cracking as we quickly worked to resuscitate him. The crash cart arrived, and I was able to switch off with another nurse as I grew exhausted. Fifteen minutes and several shocks later, the man came to. He was wheeled away to the ER with a nurse supplementing his weak breathsusing the ambu-bag. I think about him from time to time--I hope he's doing alright.  I don't like that I get so emotional during serious events, I've always considered myself to be a calm and rational person. I couldn't help but shake and fight back tears as the gravity of the situation settled in. Needless to say, I had taken a little extra time on my smoke break that day.",,3HOSI13XH0A3GCXTR1BFV53SD8YDDR,0.0

I felt that she betrayed our family by stealing while i was giving birth to my new daughter. I felt very betrayed that she would do such a  thing especially while i was giving birth. It was a very sad time for my family.  We all felt that she was a very bad mother to do this to me. I have chosen to not talk to her anymore since she did this.

The reason for it being that high is a mystery to me. When i lived in a house the bill was not that much. I can not think of a time where the bill for the electric got to this much. I had to find someone who would give me money for the bill. I decided to ask my brother for the money. I went to his house and asked him. I talked about my problem and he said he would help me. when i went over there to get the money he didn't have it. I was pretty upset so i had to come to terms with being without power.

It was located in Southern Colorado. My husband and I were needing a home and looking for a rental property, and this was a charming old house that was built in the late 1800's. Our landlord disclosed to my husband (not to me), that a previous tenant had committed suicide shortly before we were to move in. Knowing that we were already locked in and ready to move, my husband decided not to tell me about the situation for fear I would back out of the deal. It wasn't until we moved in and were settled that he shared the secret with me. The room that the tenant had killed herself in was my new office, and I had always had trouble breathing in there. There is no way to describe it other than the air was constantly sucked out of the room, so that if you were in there for any length of time with the windows and door closed, you literally could not breathe and would feel very faint, as though you needed oxygen or were going to black out. The first month we lived there, we would leave the light over the sink in the kitchen on. It would cut out at several second intervals throughout the night, which I could always see from my position in the bedroom while trying to go to sleep. It would render the house completely dark, and was unnerving. We decided to move out after two months because of the...unrest...that was felt there. Everyone who came into the house could feel the heaviness and the difficulty breathing. IT turned out that the previous tenant had overdosed, purposely, on Klonopin and suffocated in her sleep.

After a terrible divorce, being homeless, then traveling the country delivering phone books, we've finally come to a point in our lives together where we have scrimped and saved enough money to rent a house. And what a nice house! Five bedrooms, a basement, nice neighbors, a big bathroom...it is truly everything I could ever want. I wish Jarrod had told me about the previous tenant.  How long had he known that the lady had died in the front bedroom? That her body had to be taken out by paramedics, and that her soiled sheets and furniture were STILL there when we moved in? He told me to go outside, watch a movie, just anything possible to distract me while they all unlocked that bedroom door and I heard lots of coughing, gagging and hauling away of furniture. It was after that that he told me, in an almost matter-of-fact way. She died from not being able to breathe, some type of medication interaction. They called it a suicide. I went in later to wash the walls and clean the room. I put some of my books in the little built in bookshelf and opened the front window for a few days to let things air out. Each time I closed the window, the atmosphere seemed to suck in on itself. I would find myself breathing heavily, then almost gasping, feeling like my lungs were shutting down. The neighbors, who had witnessed the activity from the death of the previous tenant, were curious about us and about that room. A few of them asked if they could see it, and they also felt the strange sucking of air from their lungs. It was unnerving. The room became locked. We could never use it. Slowly, the rest of the house began to suck the air out of our lungs, too. No-one would come over. We couldn't close our windows. It felt like the house was taking our breath. We had to leave.",3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVB009CYD,,0.0

I had planned on going to see the new scary movie that just came out, but instead saw that The Shining was playing at the theater I planned on going to. To watch the movie in a theater was awesome. It enhanced every aspect of the movie and made it even better to watch. I was a little hesitant to purchase the ticket at first, but then figured, why not? Who knows the next time this movie would be in a theater again. As I got to my seat, the theater was empty. Perfect. I was all set with my popcorn and soda and ready as ever. I forgot how long it had been since I had seen this movie. The film was enhanced and restored to have picture perfect quality fit for movies today. The thrill and mystery I remembered from this movie was bigger and better than ever on the big screen. Three other people were in the theater with me and I was able to watch the movie in total relaxation and peace. I am so glad I decided to see this movie today instead of my other choice.

About two weeks ago I was doing sales calls to to my minor accounts to try to drum up some business, just a routine day really. As I walked into the main entrance and waited for security to get me my visitor badge they mentioned my normal contact person was on vacation and I would be meeting Jim from operations instead. I thought this would be unproductive as Jim will not be able to sign off for any new budget items. Well at least this I can drop off some sales sheets and some swag and build up a little good will I thought. When we met in the conference room I sensed that something was different about Jim. He seemed like a good guy, he had a warm handshake and seemed interested in what I was talking about. The conversation drifted to other topics that I was not expecting like charities he supports and volunteers for. I told him I really did not have time for that and I would toss a donation every now and then to a random charity. He asked me if I did that because I felt good to do something or really wanted to help. I said I really donate just to seem like a normal person and not stick out in the office as a dolt. When he asked if I was free for a couple hours on Saturday I said I really did not have anything going on.  He gave me an address and said ""be there by 8:00am ask for me"".When I arrived at the mission church on Saturday morning and saw the need I was blown away. Those few hours of serving breakfast to people who I never really looked at before opened my eyes. I really don't know why a chance meeting a meeting that I never thought would happen has opened my mind to a higher purpose in life.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO631RV0ME,0.0

But in the last 2 months there have been many ups and downs in my life. With regards to my mother some of the nights I come to her home, she is very pleasant. I have been out of the country for 10 days. During that time my brother stayed with my mother. She asked about me every night. After my brother went home he emailed me a list of things that needed to be taken care of. One was my mother's continued fight to take a bath or even wash has not changed.  He said we needed to try harder as we since have installed a bath chair that was recommended by the occupational therapist. So my second night back I suggested I would come to her home on Saturday morning and help her bathe. She immediately got frustrated. She told me how much she hated the bathroom aids we had installed. She started to get out of her chair to show what she hated. She pointed to the bath chair and the toilet lift and hand rail. She angry shook each piece and told me she hated it. The rest of the night was terrible. She refused to do all her normal bedtime rituals including spitting her pills across the room. She told me to never come back. So to remember what happened two months ago is not easy. Since that time the world has passed by at rapid pace. I try not to think ahead because I just try to enjoy this moment of peace.",3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVBAWLCYR,,0.0

I would get off my phone, I would spend a set amount of hours a day just being off the internet. I felt disconnected from my family, I felt we were too reliant on our phones to socialize, and it wasn't healthy at all. I wanted a change in my life. So, me an my family took a day to just toss them to the side and see how it went. It was a massive success, I was able to connect with my daughter and talk about school and how she was doing--just get to know people, not the fakeness of what's presented through text. That isn't who a person is, they have their mannerisms and their ticks and their emotions that are hidden by sterile fonts and distance. You don't truly get to know someone until you look them in the eyes and talk to them, and we had a lot of fun doing this. I think I'm able to appreciate my family more now. We're able to talk without using our thumbs. We're able to be together without having to ignore people with our phones in our face. We're forced to interact, yes, but that's a force for positive change. It's also easy on the eyes, I'd think. You can live with a bright light into your eyes constantly, you know? It's just all around healthier.",,3HRMW88U17CCLM2CSIMNZO63Q8E0MK,0.0

It was surprising how laid-back people are in Spain. The pace of life is so much slower in Spain. People take there time during meals to have conversations. We saw but did not participate in the running of the bulls. It was excited and scary to see people trying to avoid those bulls. In Austria I enjoyed some Austrian chocolate. I enjoyed interacting with the locals. I had many interesting conversations with people. I love mountains. Austria is filled with many snow-capped mountains. My trip with my friends will stay with me the rest of my life. I feel closer to my friends now. I also made some new friends.",,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON95MO25,0.0

We first landed in Ireland and it was the most amazing thing ever. We met many different people from around the world at our hostel. We got to explore Dublin and got to taste amazing food that the city had to offer.  After Ireland we took the ferry and headed towards London. We got see many historical landmarks and fully  took in the culture tasting food native to London. Then next city was Amsterdam. The art and culture that this city had to offer was breathtaking. The architecture was interesting and the bike culture pulled me in even more. We rode around the city and relaxed by the river side during the night.  Next stop was Switzerland. Once I got here I just didn't to leave at all. The natural landscape was absolutely breathtaking. My friends and I journey through this hiking trail that took us about 7 hours to complete but it was so worth it. We met alot of friendly people along the way and got to see the astonishing views that will forever be with us that we saw during the hike.  I will forever remember this trip that I took with my friends to experience different cultures and memories that was created along the way.,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON95MO25,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON95MO25,0.0

A friend of mine from work would be coming to check on the cat every few days to make sure the cat had enough food and she was comfortable.   A few weeks before the cruise, my landlord was concerned about my bathroom.  He thought there might be a leak in the bathroom, and there might be mold.  He inspected my bathroom and decided that the tiles should be replaced.   A few days before I would be leaving, the landlord brought some people over to check my bathroom.  They said the repair would take a few days, and could be done, while I was on vacation.  I my landlord that is fine, but to make sure my cat doesn't escape.  I had an enjoyable time on the vacation and when I returned to my apartment, it was in complete disarray.  My living room was a mess, and everything that was in the bathroom was spread all over the place.  I then looked for my cat, but I couldn't find her.  It was very strange, because the cat is scared and would never go outside.  I spoke with the landlord about my cat, and he said that he never saw her.  I also asked about my bathroom, and he told me it might take another week or two longer.  I happened to notice there was a hole in the bathroom, and thought there is a possibility the cat went in the hole because she wanted to explore.  I tried calling my cats name, but didn't hear anything.   Since I didn't have a working bathroom, I had to drive back to my parents house every night.  I would then drive back to my apartment to look for the cat, and then drive to work, before returning back to my apartment to look for the cat again.  One day, I told my landlord the cat could have gone in the hole, but he didn't believe me.   I was sound asleep, when I got a phone call at 3am from my landlord stating he found the cat, hiding in the ceiling.   I was able to rescue my cat and make sure she was fine.  The entire ordeal lasted almost two weeks.  Though I now lock the apartment door at all times, and make sure that I am home if anyone is going to work on my apartment.  It was very stressful because I couldn't stay in my apartment, and the landlord wasn't very helpful.",3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGONI772OH,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGONI772OH,0.0

It seems like he's always using my mental health as leverage against me. He acts like it somehow detracts from my ability to have rational thoughts and opinions. As if struggling with a mental health condition makes me less credible. If I had a physical ailment, would he do the same thing? Every time he does this, I feel so gaslit. Given the context, it's even more hurtful. A parent should take the side of their kid on something like that. You would think he would be angry on my behalf for what happened to me. Instead, he just tries to argue with me about whether it actually happened or not. It seems like he's more willing to defend his friends than stand up for his children. And even worse that he's willing to seriously damage my feelings in the process. I hope he will realize how much he hurt me, and maybe start valuing our relationship more. I don't have my hopes up, though. He isn't one to apologize or admit he was wrong in any situation, so I doubt this will be any different.",,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE,0.0

This was about 2 months ago when the attack happened. Since the person was such a dear friend of my father's, I was understandably worried to approach him about the matter. The family friend who sexually harassed me was Larry, who has been a fishing buddy of my father's for years. We were at the barbecue that was to celebrate the graduation of cousin Gertie. Everyone was laughing and having a great time, and I too was enjoying having a swim in the pool. I found myself at the deep end of the pool, and I had always been a little bit fearful of swimming over my head. There was no one else at the end of this pool and I was caught in my own world when I felt a hand brush against my thigh. I jerked away and my heart raced. At first I though something in the water had bit me. Or maybe it had just been a pool toy. But then I looked up and saw old and disgusting Larry with this sick grin on his face and his hand still near my thighs. I gasped and kicked away, ignoring my fear of deep water and swam as fast as I could. When I kicked away, I got some satisfaction when I felt my left foot slam into the side of Scary Larry's head. I wasn't really surprised that my father didn't believe me. But he did say he wondered how Larry had gotten that huge bruise on his face.",,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE,0.0

My family welcomed our youngest daughter into our lives. At that point, I was about 1 week over due. I was completely miserable and desperate to go into labor. It was Wednesday and the next day I was scheduled to be induced. My dad came to visit with his brother and sister in law. We had a pleasant visit and then they left that early afternoon. Shortly afterwards, I started to get a cramp like feeling in my lower abdomen. It grew stronger and stronger. I woke my husband up and said, ""I think I might be in labor. I don't know."" He immediately wanted to go to the hospital, but we had to wait for someone to come pick up our two older children. The pains continued in intensity and my husband finally said, ""Enough, we're going now."" We dropped off our kids with his parents and went to the hospital. I insisted we stopped and get Sonic first because I knew they wouldn't let me eat when we got there. We checked in and my husband and I anxiously waited as labor progressed. I got an epidural which helped with the contractions. At 11:31 PM I started to push. Unfortunately at this point, the epidural had worn off. After two short pushes, our youngest daughter was born. She was the most beautiful baby we had ever seen and we were so happy to have her here safely.",,3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTSTYI,0.0

Recently my daughter started calling me daddy and we have been able to interact with each other much more closely. We knew were ready for another baby (not financially) but we knew wanted to have new one come in. I told my wife I wanted to be surprised and she did the exact same thing when my first born was born. She woke me up and showed me the stick she just peed on. Funny i know but what was the first time a thought of happiness and scared was now a I'm ready and extreme excitement. 3 months later and this is where our story comes into play. I just learned that we were having another girl. Can you believe that? Sisters i thought to myself. The thought of my my little girls being best friends rand through my mind. Until i realized, how am i going to prepare with all this debt. I looked and looked online on how to make extra money. I found Mturk applied and got right to it. Paying for a new baby is never easy, even with most of the stuff already on hand. Our debt is still extremely high from living expenses and still haven't recovered from the first newborn. I knew i had to get this ball rolling and i worked and worked and slowly am seeing results from it. As the baby bump grows so does my nerves. I know I'm still not ready financially but i am just so happy to be a daddy of 2.  When baby 2 comes I KNOW that my life will change yet again but thats just the roller coaster of having a baby. First everything is fine, then nervous excitement then you prepare, as the time approaches you try to do as much as you can because once the baby is born all time is devoted to caring for it. I love being a dad and cant wait for round 2. I think i am way more prepared for it the second time around. but i guess we will see if that is actually the case.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN0ES6,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN0ES6,0.0

I also try to stay involved in the children's activities, and volunteer when I can.  It seems like there is never enough time. I don't glorify busyness, either.  I really do try to find ways to cut back, but with three children, two jobs, and no help, it is super hard.

I found one way up high with pretty poor view because none of the lower ones were available. At that point, I had no idea where my son was, no idea if I would even be able to see him or not. He texted me as the commencement started and told me where he was. Based on that, I was a little upset because I had definitely chosen the opposite side of the arena from him and was very far away. In spite of that, I absorbed the whole ceremony and kept one eye always fixed on his head, small as an ant. The whole time, I balanced between crying with pride and joy and smiling so hard that my cheeks and jaw hurt. In the end, my bad seating location turned out to be central to the single most memorable moment of the night. As the graduates were being released by row to leave the room, I saw that I was sitting directly over the exit that they were filing out through. Everyone around me was standing and I'm not that tall, so as he approached the exit, I got on my toes as high as I could and raised my arm so he could hopefully see me. With about 30 feet to go before he passed under me, he looked up and directly at me and we locked eyes. I will never forget the look he had on his face. It was so almost too special to be described...a combination of pride, joy, thankfulness, humility. Words don't do justice to that little moment we shared. Mother and son loving, knowing and understanding each other without words.",3HYA4D452S5DBMD9LIMONMF9HHD2F5,,0.0

He is 23 years old and had a wonderful job offer he had decided to take. I don't care how old he is, he is my youngest, my baby, and it hurts that he left.

We would talk about everything and I feel like this separation will pull us apart. I know in my head that he is a grown man and has to make decisions that are right for him but my heart wants to hold him close. I tried to be happy for him and to put on a strong face. When he left he cried, hugged me close and said he would miss me. That broke my heart. I cried so hard I felt like I was dying inside. Of course his father told me I was being ridiculous, I don't care what he says, I feel like a part of me is gone. My older son Tim, he is staying here and I have to hold on to that. I love him just as much as Kenny but we were never as close. He does not confide in me and ask me for guidance. I don't feel like he needs me as much anymore. I hated living in Florida. It was always hot and the people there are selfish and mean. West Virginia feels like home. I love it here. But to be here means losing out on being with my son. I feel so torn but I have to do what is right for me. He has to grow and become a man on his own. I understand but I don't want to let go.

It was pretty scary at first, but the regulars there only encouraged me. It was wonderful, and they helped me get into a weight loss routine. I started jogging with them as well as use the treadmills. I actually made some fitness friends along the way. Mind you, I still needed this minor surgery to be done. I still felt it from time to time. I lost over 100 pounds in the course of a year and a half, and I was able to go back to my doctor.

I told them we weren't going there and we were just visiting family and going sight-seeing. Little did they know, I had bought tickets for the whole family. When we got to my dad's house, we all had a big dinner and dessert. When we were done eating, I went around the table and gave each of them a ticket. My kids went crazy. My dad told me there's no way he wasn't going to pay me back for these considering how expensive they were. Honestly, I was expecting that, as well as hoping for that. We all had an amazing time for about 10 hours. Then we went home.",,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ2G3O57,0.0

Since plane tickets are so expensive, I thought it would be more economical to drive down to Florida with my four children.  We packed up the car and stayed one night at a hotel halfway there.  Once we arrived to my dad's house, a few family members came over to celebrate and visit with us.  During the week-long stay, we went to the beach, ate out a couple of times, and played with my dad's new puppy.  The kids had an excellent time and even collected some sea shells to bring home.  My dad and step-mother decided to surprise us with tickets to Walt Disney World.  I'm not sure I've ever seen my children so excited.  It was hot and crowded there, but it's a memory I wouldn't trade for the world.  My children had so much seeing the sites only viewed before on television.  They really had fun when the mascots would approach them.  Too soon, our trip was over and we had to head back home.  We tearfully said goodbye and started our car trip back.  Though we enjoyed our visit very much, we were very happy to be home.  My husband couldn't travel with us due to work, so we had something to look forward to when we got back.",3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ2G3O57,,0.0

I will recount what unfolded below.""Dad is dying"". These words made me sick to my stomach as my brother called me. He had never been a part of my life, but I was always fond of the memories I had with him when I was a child up to the age of seven, when the divorce happened. This man who I missed, but barely knew. And now he wasn't long for the world. I made it to the hospice they kept him at. Coming into the room, I stared at the frail figure reclining on the bed before me. A well of sadness for the pitiable man came up through me, and I pulled up a seat beside him. We talked when he came to, and during the next two months we talked for the most we had ever had, even more than we had when we were a family. I didn't want to bring up his mortality as I imagined he would have wanted to talk about other things, so I did my best to get to know the man, his passions, his regrets, his proudest moments. I had gotten back to the hotel where I stayed when I got the call that he had passed away. I didn't feel much emotion at the time because I had expected it. Then came another call, a frantic one.""Where's Dad?"" Did they lose the body? Before I could respond, ""Oh I was at the wrong room."" My brother had been drinking. The funeral had been set for last week, open casket. But furiously, they had a problem with the embalming, so closed casket it was going to be. At the end of the funeral, as the other pallbearers and I went to pick up the coffin, it felt strangely light. Too light, as in empty light. Frantic, we opened up the casket, and Dad was missing. We're still looking for him.",,3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ33MO51,0.0

At first it didn't seem like the ""boat police"" were doing anything to help, but it was only a few hours before they caught the man that had broken in. My aunt got her jewelry back and when we got to the port they put the man off the boat. I was surprised that we were able to put it behind us and have fun. My aunt even led the conga line around the deck after dinner. It's amazing how quickly she forgave the whole incident. The cruise ship was really nice to us after that and they even upgraded our rooms for us. They moved us into a few of their family suites that were unoccupied.

The weather was very hot, as there was a heat wave in Europe. The buses we took for excursions had very little air conditioning, making the trips miserably hot. In general, we had fun, however the days were very long and tiring. The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip.

I’ve been trying to raise my kids with the same values that were instilled in me, so four months ago, I brought my daughter along for our charity food truck run.	We were just going to drop off some canned goods and a few baked goods my wife baked, but my daughter took it one step further. She wanted to get some plastic eggs and fill them with Easter candy to hand out along with the food. Bless her heart. I know people say that teenagers only care for themselves, but she’s such a good girl.	So, we did exactly that. On the way to the shelter, we picked up some eggs and candy, only a few dozen or so. We sat right in the back of the truck and individually placed candy in each egg. We grabbed a couple of baskets, plopped the eggs in, and drove on over.	I couldn’t believe the affect that such a simple, inexpensive gesture would have on these folks. I know they’re usually grateful when we drop off food, especially around the holidays, but this little extra something special really drove it home for them; people truly do care about each other. Even she wept at seeing how it made them feel.	I couldn’t thank my daughter enough for reminding me of this lesson, something so simple that I truly forgot it.

The job was a step down in pay for me, but it worked at the time. When I was hired I was promised that my boss would be retiring soon and I could advance. I took the job with the understanding that I could quickly take a management position. A year went by and I was still stuck in the same place. My supervisor keeps saying he will retire but in the end pushes it off for another six months. Five years later I am still in the same place and keep hearing the same promises. I was finally to the point of looking for a new job when I got the word that my boss had submitted his retirement paperwork. I got a call from the director to meet him in the office to discuss my future. He said that he had been impressed with my dedication and work ethic. He had decided that they did not need to look outside to fill the position and that I would be be taking over the position effective immediately.  This new position carried with it a large raise and a lot more responsibilities.  I was thrilled because I have worked for this for a long time and my hard work and patience had finally paid off. With the extra money I can finally get a house for my family and pay off some of our debts which will be as huge relief. It goes to show me that hard work is rewarded in the end.",3IAEQB9FMF62PIXK8WG5NTSDH5HDW8,3IAEQB9FMF62PIXK8WG5NTSDH5HDW8,0.0

I experienced a death in my family as I watched my father pass away from complications of diabetes. I was never that close to my father growing up, as I didn't grow up with him for the majority of my life. My mother got a divorce with him when I was still a child and I lived with her all of my life. From time to time I would receive updates from my father, sometimes gifts for birthdays, but for the most part most of it was quiet. It wasn't until recently that I found out that my father's health was deteriorating rapidly. He moved up to New York coming from living in Florida all his life so I had more chances to see him and get to know him better as we ultimately knew that his life was not so certain anymore. I was still bitter from the rocky relationship that we had growing up, but I still forgave him. From our limited time together over the last couple of months he would tell me all types of stories from his childhood. Such his life growing up in Italy, to coming to America and working multiple jobs just to support himself. His life was rough and I started to find a new respect for my father after getting more details on his life. He apologized to me from what has become of our relationship and gave me his blessings for my future. He told me that I need to keep his memory alive to my wife and eventual family that I will build up. He finally passed away after many years of have diabetes that just worsened over time. Looking back on it I wasn't too upset because I finally got the chance to spend more time with him. I gained more insight on his life was a child and it gave me perspective on how I am today as a person. I am grateful for having a father and for the time I spent with him.",,3IFS6Q0HJJ5QQCWXG57FH155V8MIS7,0.0

In the past 7 Months my sister called my mum and told her she was pregnant Previously before that concerned family member would ask her about how she was doing with her relationship and we would get no concrete answer from here nor neither has anyone seen a man with her. She is 34 and so not a baby or child that cant be with a man of her own. I was also chocked when i brief that she was pregnant, every member of the family became instantly concerned on whom who impregnated her was. My sister was very secretive and doesn't easily tell other about herself not even me nor our bother and she hardly keeps friends, so there was no way to understand her except by watching her. Finally she brought him home and my mother didn't waste time to tell her it was time to prepare for the wedding because in our family we don't allow ladies have babies before getting married. It first it looked like he wasn't ready and everybody was bothered and hoping he doesn't abandon my sister and run away. A week later he dialed in and requested the family audience for the introduction,he was invited over for a family dinner where he explained his reasoning and asked my mother to allow him marry my sister officially. The next day a day was picked and 3 weeks later the wedding will be done, i was so excited that finally my sister would get married and everyone will feel less bothered about her as we used to all the time. The wedding was unplanned for but no body cared or complained because we all understood what we are trying to achiever and it came into play. The wedding was intended to be a small gathering of only close family relatives on both bride and groom side but that was not the case. Many people not invited showed up at the event and we almost ran out of supply to entertain the guest, luckily it was near a restaurant and i took it as my responsibility to save the day. I walked into the restaurant and ordered all available dishes to be brought to the event premises before the the public addressing finished. Luckily i was right on time, and the restaurant food were used to complement the catering services food that was organized for the event. It was really a very hectic time for all the family members as we had less time to prepare for this great even we had always hoped for because my sister was the first born and she had 4 sibling and in which all are married. It was really a beautiful day and we all went home after the ceremony with joy in our heart like as if finally we discovered where heaven was and that day was the day we went there.",,3IFS6Q0HJJ5QQCWXG57FH155YBMSIQ,0.0

It was memorable because I saw many types of wildlife such as deer, geese, snakes, and different types of bees. The only reason that I was able to see so much wildlife was because we went on hikes and long walks through wilderness areas where there weren't many people. The wildlife didn't appear to be afraid of us either so we were able to get pretty close. I think the most memorable thing that happened was when I saw a family of deer and really young one was sticking close to their mother. I had never seen a deer that young before and it was so early in the season. We also went to a lake in the mountains where we saw some birds nesting and eating among the ice. Because it was still winter, I guess the ice hasn't melted. That is where we saw some turtles and shore birds trying to enjoy the sun in winter. The weather was going to change soon (snow) so we were trying to get outdoors before the storm came in. We also went to a local trail where there were a bunch of gardens made specifically for insects and pollinators. I was able to spot a bunch of bees all over the place in those gardens and that was fun. Oh and the rocks and mountains we saw were full of history and interesting geology as well. The history of that area goes back millions of years and I heard that dinosaurs were found north of the area we explored. We did some other activities, but that was the most interesting by far.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBBLZP46,,0.0

Her brother, who has the bottom bunk, said she was scared by something she had seen in the window. I thought for sure he was joking, my daughter is not one to be easily startled. And honestly, it was a Saturday morning, so I really didn't understand why the twins were up this early anyhow. I went over to the window, just to be sure there was nothing there. And good Lord, there was a bobcat in the tree. I have heard on the news that the wildlife is moving into the suburban neighborhoods, mostly from our taking over their natural habitat with building new homes and businesses, but I hadn't really believed it until now. The cat was a pretty good size, about 40 pounds, and solid black. He gave me quite a start too.  I double checked my daughter to be sure she didn't have a concussion, and decided I had to call animal control. It really saddens me that we are pushing out the wildlife with our greed and selfishness and need to keep on building. Especially in Texas, I notice this happening too much. I wish we could live in harmony and build more environmentally by not destroying whole habitats. I made the choice against animal control, and called an animal rescue, relocation unit instead.  This isn't the ideal choice, but it was the best option I had at the time. The unit came and told me the cat would be taken to a state part out west. My daughter was ok, just startled, and this was a great teaching opportunity for us.",,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQB420P4Y,0.0

It started out when I had to work a double shift and came home ridiculously tired the night before. I had only slept a total of 4 hours before I heard the thud and the scream from my 7 year old son which felt like it filled the house. It was 6 am and I was immediately taken in an out of body experience which is all I can describe it as. I heard my son screaming for help and I immediately screamed for my wife because I thought I was going to find my daughter dead in her room. My son was crying over my daughter as she shook and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head. I was sure that she was choking on something and my son through tears kept telling me she may have swallowed a lego because they had been playing with them. I felt sick and told my wife to call the ambulance right away. We were screaming at each other and crying and I shoved my fingers in my daughters throat to try and get her airway clear because I was positive it was choking. I even started doing heart compresses. I thought she was going to be gone and I have never been more afraid. I felt myself outside of my body looking in at that moment. My son was terrified and I did not keep it together well for him. When the ambulance came my wife was sure it was a seizure by the way she was reacting after. She immediately fell asleep and we took her to the ER. She had to have an xray to confirm that there was nothing blocking her airways. It was the single most terrifying moment in my life. My daughter has epilepsy.,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQB420P4Y,,0.0

Last year was the worst team i've been a part of as we lost every game, most by blowout. That kind of record isnt really attractive for new players. I can only hope that the guys we had last year come back and continue to gain experience and grow. I know we had a solid core group of older guys who are the back bone of our team. We just need to get those younger players more involved and connected with everyone. One thing i know for sure is that im going to continue playing until i just cant do it anymore.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP54P0,,0.0

Watching my 5 year olds face light up at the sight of his favorite character (Stitch) is something I will never forget. The food was memorable for a different reason. On our fourth night of vacation, we ate at a restaurant called ""Chef Mickey's"" in the Contemporary resort. My wife had researched a lot for our trip and had warned me that we weren't going for a fabulous food experience as she had booked this restaurant solely for the purpose of the character experience for our son. Chef Mickey's is a buffet restaurant that features the ""fab 5,"" Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, and Goofy. It is an easy way to meet the characters without waiting in long lines in the parks. After being seated, we browsed the expansive buffet that winded around the restaurant. I marveled at the open concept of the restaurant which enabled patrons to view the monorails as they traveled through the hotel a few floors above. It is a quite impressive space. The food was typical buffet fare. I had low expectations so I was not bothered despite the steep price we paid. My wife and I decided to nibble on some boiled shrimp and have a cocktail then pick up a hamburger later on that evening because we were underwhelmed by the selections. My son enjoyed his selections of chicken and broccoli and the characters and then we returned to the parks. Before the fireworks even began that night, my wife and I both started feeling very ill. We spent the next day in our hotel room very, very sick. Luckily, my son did not catch anything. Our hotel desk was amazing and sent a doctor to our room. We were able to salvage the last two days of our vacation for our son's sake and we plan on going back next year but we will definitely never again eat at Chef Mickey's.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,,0.0

It was an amazing time and we made so many memories that I know will stay with all of us forever. Since it was my 5 year old son's first trip to Disney World, we tried to make it extra special by booking a lot of character restaurants. On our arrival day, we ate dinner at Chef Mickey's. The food was terrible but the character interactions were well worth the lack of flavor and the price of our meals. Seeing my son's face light up when Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy came to our table to interact with him was priceless. He was so happy. The next morning before heading to the parks, we had breakfast at 'Ohana with Lilo, Stitch, and Mickey. Stitch is one of my son's favorite characters right now so he was literally speechless when he saw him roaming around the restaurant. His expression upon meeting Lilo was unexpected and the most precious thing I have ever seen. He held her hand and stared up at her like she was the greatest thing he had ever seen. I ended up ordering that print and will frame it. Later that night while taking a break from the Magic Kingdom, we ate at the T-Rex restaurant because my son is really into dinosaurs at the moment. That was a lot of fun but the food was sub par. On our 3rd day, we ate breakfast at 1900 park faire with Cinderella, Prince Charming, and the wicked step mother. It was a better food experience but my son was not very into the characters. That night, we ate at Garden Grill in Epcot with Chip and Dale. The food was sub par again but the characters were so much fun. All in all, we learned that park food, even in the restaurants is not very good. The lunches and dinners that we had in Disney Springs were amazing though. Our resort was just a short boat ride from Disney Springs so when we took a break from the parks around lunch time, I would run get lunch and bring it back to the resort while my son rested.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,0.0

I started putting up feeders around to see some of the nature. For the first few weeks I got nothing and no activity, then about a month ago animals came. Mostly squirrels at first and a few deer, and one tiny humming bird. I was out misting the peonies and the bird kept flitting in and out of the hose. I moved the hose and the bird moved too. Eventually i got a chair and just sat spraying the mist and letting the bird flutter around. They are incredibly beautiful creatures and also very small. I worried i might get it too wet to fly but that didnt happen. I was happy the bird was there and it seemed happy to be getting misted. It was a wonderful moment of man and nature coming together. As the bird flew away I smiled and hoped he would be back again. So far i havent seen him but i will remember the simple joy i got that morning. I am glad i could provide for nature and enjoy moments like that. I hope everyone can take some time to enjoy the little things in life.",,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,0.0

I was watering the plants, vegetables, and Cacti. I was feel kind of low due to not seeing many of my friends anymore due to everyone being busy with their own schedule, and work being a little slow was also on my mind. I may have been feeling sorry for myself, but the wounds were real. As I watered the cacti by the chain link fence I noticed a humming bird. At first I thought he was just doing his early morning pollen rituals, but to my surprise he wanted water. The thing is he did not want water to drink he wanted to get wet by the mist of the garden hose. I turned down the pressure of the hose to a fine mist and pointed the mist into the direction of the humming bird . The bird loved it he stayed stationary in the water stream for a long time. If I moved the hose a little he would follow to stay in the stream. It was great the bird had no fear of animosity of a human. He knew there was a human controlling the hose and he did not care he wanted water on this warm summer day. I felt great, I felt a connection with this little bird, we at this brief aquatic encounter were friends. It seemed that God saw my loneliness and sent me a friend. That small communal moment with nature make me feel better for the rest of the day. I started to realize that day can friends come in all shapes and sizes.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARVLCQDT,0.0

For the past year, I'd been thinking about buying a house with the intention of flipping it. I liked the idea of taking something, applying hard work to it, and then selling it for a profit. The only problem was that I had difficulty getting a loan. My credit isn't the best. I had a decent chunk of money I'd saved monthly from my paycheck, but it wasn't enough for the down payment. Then my friend, Thomas, told me about the money market. He said he'd been playing the market for about a year now and had made over $100K. It sounded good to me, and I never do anything without researching it carefully first, so I spent the next four months learning the ins and outs of the market. About 2 months ago, I was feeling pretty confident and invested all of the money I had saved from my paycheck (about $15K) in the market. It wasn't long before it started paying off. I guess I got lucky, because I had doubled my money! Then it tripled! It was like a dream come true. I had enough to make the down payment on the house, but then I got thinking. If I keep this going I won't have to flip the house at all. I can just sit here and let the money keep growing! I hadn't lost yet, so, 2 weeks ago, I took all of the money I'd made so far and invested it back in the market. I had a pleasant weekend and then Money morning I checked the market performance. It was gone. My money was all gone! I seriously hadn't expected it at all and the outcome hit me like a ton of bricks.

The girl I met there, Julie, called today and asked how I was. I'm not exactly sure how to take it though given that she hadn't called before now. It's been ages since I got along with someone so well, and everything we had in common made night one for the ages, plus there was a wedding happening! I can't believe Jake managed to get Vulfpeck to play his wedding. That's Jake's style though, all class, and an absolute jazz fanatic. I can't believe how much they must have paid for that shindig between the band, and that incredibe spread from Chez Gus. That guy is a big time chef, I didn't even think he did catering, but Jake can be a persuasive mofo. I guess the Franklins can be too haha. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had such a completely satisfying experience. That sounds underwhelming, but it cover all the bases and that's the best way to describe it. All 5 senses were satiated, the conversation was inteligent yet casual, and Julie sure made the overnight memorable. I think I will try and stay in touch with her, at the least. Who knows, maybe her and I can recreate that night someday, only swap ourselves in as the happy couple. Or maybe we can just hang and bang.

When I was in the third grade, he was diagnosed with diabetes. In the beginning, he was careful about what he ate. My mom helped to prepare special meals for him. They called it the ""orange tray diet"" because she bought him a special tray to use. It was so cute. Over the years, he picked up some of his old eating habits. His condition worsened slowly. It led to other health problems. By the time I was 21, my father had to have a quadruple bypass surgery. It was terrifying, but successful. He still kept his bad habits. A couple of years ago he was diagnosed with kidney failure and that's what made him change the way he lived. For the last few years he's been exercising and eating exactly what the doctors tell him to. Since kidney damage is not able to be reversed in late stages, he had to be put on dialysis. We just found out a couple of weeks ago that he is a candidate for a kidney transplant and will be beginning tests for that in the upcoming months. I am so grateful for my dad's second chance at life. We were not close at all when I was growing up, but this has bonded us. I can't imagine losing him now.",,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09JCCIRE,0.0

She was in sharp pain and needed to be driven to the hospital. I freak out and immediately hopped in my car and sped over there. When I got to her she was in a great deal of pain and could not move without help. She said her entire chest area felt numb and was like being stabbed with a knife over and over. Once we got to the hospital the doctors immediately noticed her symptoms resembled that of a stroke. They did everything they could do and informed me that they would need to hold her for a number of days to run tests. Surprisingly, when the tests came back they showed that it wasn't a stroke, but a rotator cuff tear. Due to the fact that they mimick similar symptoms, rotator cuff tears are often labeled as strokes early on because of the sheer amount of pain the patient is in. Once we were given the news it was a remarkable relief. Even though my mother has been forced to undergo significant physical therapy over the last few months, so is finally getting close to 100%. A stroke at her age would have been extremely detrimental to her further health, so we are very thrilled that she was held at the hospital for extra time. I also remember thanking the doctor for being thorough at the time. I remember that he mentioned it could possibly be something aside from a stroke, but I simply disregarded it at the time. Now that mother is nearly back to full health we can resume playing golf again, which is great news for both of us. Her swing might not look the exact same as it used to, but at least we can get out and walk the courses together like we always have!",,3IKZ72A5B529082271K8FAI710DNFB,0.0

All of these things happened before we met. Six years ago, my husband passed away, and this year, the oldest of the two children turned 18. This young lady recently found me on facebook, and sent me a personal message. She wanted to express her condolences for my loss. As she is just 18, and just found out that her father is now deceased, she is very overwhelmed. She has grown into a beautiful young lady though, and I am hopeful that we will be able to get together and share out memories. The circumstances around her dads death were not pleasant. He died by suicide, and part of the reason was because of what happened with the girls and the fact that he was their dad and couldn't protect them and then lost them forever. I am overwhelmed by the situation because even though right now she is not ready to hear the story or the details, I know that eventually she is going to want me to relive everything that happened over the last couple of years of her dads life. I have saved things for her and her sister all these years that my husband had in his possession. I have pictures, and home movies, and their quilts from when they were babies. I am letting her come to me on her own accord, in her own time. I am hopeful to one day have a relationship with her. My husband and I had a son together, and so they have a half brother. I hope that one day they can meet him.",3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZKTU86Z,3IO1LGZLKAJSE8MN06SL37FZKTU86Z,0.0

It was quiet long when i used o be friend with my now husband.           We lived in a small town where we used to work far from home. He was one of my friends cousin.           As my friends family was my family's family friend.           I was working five days a week and go to Aunts house in the weekend. And it was a long routine of about an year.            At this point o time one fine day when i went there I saw him,was quiet surprised as i was not familiar with that face or personality. But i had caught a sight of ""love at first sight""            As he was a impressive person with warm attitudes.            We spend weekend together with my friend ,We exchanged out thoughts , feelings , and found that our wavelengths sinks so well.            At that point of time i had decided that he is the perfect person.            He is my soul mate,and i started manifesting him to my life.            Later in few weeks we developed a true friendship between us. My friend was of great support to us.            We started sharing our personal thoughts about the views of life,The point of view where we are more attached or detached .             Slowly we created our own world of friendship which was unexplained. We were in such a position that each gestures were understood by the other .            At times we didn't had to speak to express our feeling ,rather understood.                      Yes the miracle happened                                  we are now married and living a happiest life together.                                 I found my soul mate,Rather i manifested my soul mate.",,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR6NN167,0.0

I sit here thinking back to the beginning and how we met and it all seems like a dream. I traveled often for work at the time. I was away from home 5 days a week, and I would come home on the weekends. I was single and very focused on my career. This particular weekend I had been sent to the other side of the country for a week. I was sitting in my hotel room one night bored and I decided to walk around and find somewhere to get some food. I wound up in a little pizza place. I was staring at my phone, reading a work email, while I ate pizza with the other hand. I must have looked like such a snob.  As I was walking out of the pizzeria a man stopped me to compliment my sweater. I looked up and, as cliche as it sounds, I just felt my heart explode. This was the most attractive man I had ever seen. The rest is very fairy tale-like. We started talking in that pizzeria and I don't think we stopped for 8 hours. We walked around the city all night and chatted and got to know each other. Fast forward to 2 years later and we are madly in love. I decided to leave my old job and find one that required less traveling. I also moved across the country. I can't believe it has been 2 years already since I found my soulmate.",,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSR6NN167,0.0

During the time of writing this diary entry, I had not seen them. Recently, my father and I went on a vacation to his home country. I hadn't seen my father in six months. During this time i was able to visit family and hang out with friends. Visiting my fathers country was very rewarding but also very tiring. We walked for miles an d took public transportation everywhere. We ate a lot of food that was delicious. A downside to the trip was getting sick. I am not quite sure what i had. I suspect it was either food poisoning or sun poisoning. It's hard to pinpoint as we ate at many restaurants that did not have healthy options and I had gotten a severe sunburn. I had a fever for a few days and had stomach issues the days following up to today. It was a great trip to bond with my dad and to explore the area where he grew up. I hope to come back in the near future.",3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSRWD061V,,0.0

Everything seemed washed with God's special brush. We were walking down Spanish River Road with our arms around each other. We didn't even hear or see the bus. I pulled her closed and her foot hit a rock on the ground. She said ""ooomph"" and fell to one knee. As I grabbed her arm and pulled up her other foot slipped on some gravel and she went splay-footed next to the dirt strip that functioned as a sidewalk in that part of Florida. By now we each heard the bus, its engine loud as a jet, its brakes screeching in a panic stop. The bus' front tire ran over Lizzie's thighs, and a second later the double rear tires ran over her hip with a sickening crunch. I crouched by her head, and shouted for her to wake up. She did not. A growing pool of blood appeared under her legs. What happened after that was a blur. There were EMTs, an ambulance, and a ride to Southern General. Not being a blood relative, I was not allowed past the ICU doors. I later learned that her parents had come and taken her back to Merseyside. I wrote and I called, but I never heard back.",,3IOEN3P9S85A38221LJ6OXSRGJK61B,0.0

Unfortunately, the weather did not permit and they ended up having to cancel the games. As luck would have it, the weekend they ended up having us play the previously scheduled double header, we also had a double header. This meant that we had to play four games in one day, the elusive quadruple header. This wouldn't be so bad, but it was on one of the hottest days of the summer and they scheduled them back-to-back-to-back-to-back. The first game went fine, though the entire team was already drenched in sweat and the sun continued to beam down from the heavens. It was about midway through the second game that I think we realized just how taxing this was going to be. Our spirits were still high, but we could all tell that it was going to be quite an intense experience by the end of it all. By the third game, we were just about spent. Luckily, we played a team that was around our skill level, so if I remember correctly, we were able to pull out a win. The last game, however, was another story entirely. The team had just gotten done with a tournament in a nearby town and were also exhausted. Their talent level far succeeded ours, further hurting our confidence. Some of their players were playing in Crocs and I don't think they even had a full team. We still got buried. They ended up ending the game early because of how many runs they were beating us by. I think we were just happy to be done. All in all, I don't even remember how many of those games we ended up winning versus losing, but the most memorable part was how our team stuck together through the radiating heat that we had to weather for four miserable hours. If there's one thing I learned about that day, it's that I absolutely love softball because I would do it all over again.",3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI0NQ6CA,,0.0

I decided to stay at my job because this is a passion of mine.  Later after he attacked me he was sent to a safety room.   He needed some time to cool down.  He eventually cooled down.  He did say sorry later  and i did forgive him.,,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI19E6C7,0.0

His high fitness, but his bad attitude. One of the most common mistakes of some workers who are excellent in work and have a great career, is their bad attitude. You do not have to take your personal problems to work with you on a daily basis, nor are others to blame for them. As expert as it may be in your role within the company, this does not ""give you the right"" to treat others badly or to be in the majority of times of bad character, causing others to have to guess when you are in good standing. humor to be able to approach you.        .    It is jumping from bliss. He received the ascent he expected so much. Or on the contrary, he took it by surprise. He is too young and has advanced by leaps and bounds in that ladder of his company. The truth is that a promotion will always be a reason to celebrate. Not only do they improve their economic conditions, but they also progress along the path that has been drawn from the professional field. He feels comfortable with what he has achieved. It is the result of that effort, dedication, but above all, passion that impresses you with your work. However, what seems at first glance only a panorama of good news, can also generate some differences between your coworkers, quarrels, suspicions, and even out of context comments such as ""you are too inexperienced for that position"" or ""will you be able with this new position? Some will be amazed, others will make blinding comments, especially if you have worked with them from “you to you” and find it difficult to give them the level of boss. These and other situations may arise at the time of coupling to your new position, so it is important that you know how to handle them with all assertiveness and intelligence, so that the ship you are sailing on now does not shipwreck.

The event came at us out of left field last spring when my son announced he was finally getting married to a beautiful girl he had started dating for over 4 years! We didn't really expect it, because they had been dating so long. Well, the day finally came and my son looked like a million bucks. He was dressed to the nines in his black tuxedo, with his beard neatly groomed, and a smile from ear to ear. Then we saw the bride and wow what a dress! She was beaming with joy and excited more than I've ever seen her before. The bride's parents had rented a really nice outdoor chapel on the side of a mountain in the North Georgia Mountains. The place was incredibly beautiful this time of year as fall is quickly approaching us. Many of my sons friends and family were there, people from his childhood, church, and schools. It is so memorable and significant for me thinking about that day. I sat there thinking back over the years at all the amazing times that we have had together, and at the same time I was watching him stating his vows and thinking about the man he has become. After the wedding ceremony they had a reception that went for about four hours. It was pretty fun and everyone got to dance and party like their was no tomorrow. I danced with my wife and my fifteen year old daughter both. It was a very special moment for myself and my wife on the dance floor because we didn't get married in a church, and had no reception. So...ultimately seeing him married and thinking back over the past when we had him at 18 and where we are now, was very special to all of us.",3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5HA6JSY,3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5HA6JSY,0.0

My son's drinking has put him in the hospital with a seizure and he's had at least one more since then.  The emergency room doctor told my daughter-in-law that her liver is dangerously enlarged and she's killing herself with her vodka consumption.  My son, Lucas, recently got hired back at a previous job.  His wife told me she's packing two little bottles of vodka with his lunch because if he stops cold turkey it could kill him.  They call it his regiment.  A doctor told them that he needs to taper off but not slowly.  Every day he should drink half as much as the day before so it shouldn't even take a week until he's alcohol-free.  Then he needs to address cravings and the reasons for his destructive behavior.  Needless to say, that job didn't even last two weeks.  They are homeless, living in my daughter's garage,.  It wasn't so bad in the summer but it's cold now so they'll be using a space heater.  Now I have to worry about a fire on top of everything else.  I've always been a happy person.  I like to laugh and sing, but my son's drunkenness hangs over me like doom.  It's hard to be happy without deciding to forget about him, which I can't do anyway.",3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG,,0.0

The team they played second put up more of a fight, but we won by 10 points. The third team was tough and played well. We only won by 3 points, but advanced to the final team. The team was tired and we could tell. Clouds began to come out and I hoped it would stay away until the last game was over. We knew this would be a tough game, but agreed that these were to 2 best teams. The game started slow, the players are obviously tired. The score stayed close the entire game. In the eighth inning it began to rain a little. By the ninth inning the rain was more sturdy, but the teams played on since there was no lighting and the rain was not too hard.

We clicked on a level I didn't think I would be able to click with someone else. I instantly felt a deep connection when meeting this person online. It was a pleasure to actually get to see her face, hug her and just talk to her in a real situation and it was fantastic to just be with her. I felt like a part of me that was missing was finally here. The first day we met, we went to the lake. It was wonderful to see her face as she realized the expanse of this lake. Playing in the water and collecting rocks for our rock hounding was so much fun. When we were done, we compared rocks and laughed over who found what and who had the prettiest. Sitting by the bonfire and just talking was so calming and peaceful. The heat of the fire, the flames burning bright in the dark night made for a surreal environment.

My direct supervisor was abusive toward me and other employees. I was not the first employee to leave due to her behavior. I had previously spoken with management regarding her behavior and was promised things would improve, but things gradually got worse and worse until I could no longer stand the abuse. I left without giving notice and had no other job lined up. In retrospect, I should not have left in the way that I did. I wish I had spoken to management again to try to resolve the issue. I had good benefits with that position and my benefits are comparable, but not as good at my new job. I also had seniority within my department that I lost and I had to start over in my new position. I reached out to my department manager (my supervisor's boss) after I left, and never heard anything back from her. That was the most surprising thing in this experience. I worked with her for nearly four years and we had a good relationship. I expected her to at least call and check in to see what happened, but did not hear anything at all. I was extremely disappointed in her for this. I felt like she really didn't care about me at all and that I was a tool for her to use in her department to make money. I was unemployed for two months, and my family had to dip into our savings a little bit in order to squeeze by. My wife was initally supportive, but grew resentful when I went weeks with no job offers. We faced significant issues in our relationship during this period that we are still getting over. There were several jobs that I saw during the two months I was unemployed that I was enthusiastic about. I felt that I was well-qualified and they were positions that I though I would do well in. I had several interviews over the phone and a handful of in-person interviews. I did not get the job that I wanted most. I did find a job that pays similarly to what I was making at my previous job. It is a good job with potential for growth. I have steadily settled into the new position and it is going well.",3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N33VGKWU,,0.0

This is the most challenging obstacle for me in that situation. But, I tried myself with the help of my college professors and my friends. And I stood against all my seniors in that challenging obstacle. That was the first experience to face a problem in my work place and finally I came to an solution to solve such kind of problems. Although at the time, my company CEO call me upon for a meeting which is an important meeting to discuss about the new products and signing an agreement of a company. This becomes my greatest achievement because of my hard work from my own capability do anything that a fresher can! I proved this and hence I'm the very younger person came to attend this meeting. In life, a person has to learn that he/she must be ready to do anything that is difficult in today's society, also should know that no one will help them for anything that they know even it is very simple to solve. The world is full of jealous about other peoples what they are doing in their life. As I learnt was to struggle in the bad situations to achieve the things to be better than the worse. After this incident my seniors of the company appreciate for my effort without knowledge of them and achieved a great success in my life. This is my most memorable, sweetest memory that happened before 2 months. Also I will never forget this memory till the rest of my life. So, if we don't have a place to learn, we should make a place to learn.

I went to my high school reunion! I can't believe I actually did it! And that it was so much fun... When I got the invite months ago, my first reaction was ""Naahhh, not going..."" But then I started thinking about it and felt a bit like a coward not wanting to even take the small risk of spending an uninteresting evening. So I decided I would go. When I showed up there, the first thing that struck me was how little the school had changed. It was a bit like a time warp actually. There were some small things that were more current, but mostly, the place was still very much the same, with the same vibe. Then there were the people. And that's when I could see time had passed, although more for some than others. I had wondered whether or not it would be an occasion to talk to people I didn't use to be close to. You know, like, now we're all adults and we've changed so we're more open to other things and it's easy to reach out to someone and just get to know them - more than back then. But actually, no. The groups reformed almost immediately as they were back then. And I suppose it's normal. When I got there, my old friends had pretty much all arrived and were in a corner, chatting very happily. They spotted me and called to me and that was it. Back to the good old times. It was so much fun to see them again. Most of them I had totally lost track of, although I'm still in touch with two of them. So there was a lot of catching up. But also a lot of reminiscing. And the result was completely seamless and very lighthearted and breezy.  Time flew by. And then it was 2 AM and we were the last crew standing and they had to kick us out. And because that's what we are/were, we moved our little party to the lawn in front of the school and we kept on partying for another hour and a half.",3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW2BX09BA,3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW2BX09BA,0.0

We were in Florida, the sun shining above us, the heat of the sun on our backs. It was beautiful. We had a free week of any work and school for the kids between the 16 and 23 of July, and it was an amazing opportunity we couldn't pass up. Our kids were distracted by the sand and the water. Me and my husband were calm and relieved for the first time in God knows how long. We actually enjoyed ourselves. I remember my daughter found a full sand dollar and showed it off to us, and I was shocked. I had never seen a complete one in my life, only pieces. My husband pretended to care, but I knew he was dozing off on his fold out chair while trying to maintain a conversation with out excited daughter. I held up the conversation for him, sparing him it. He deserved to rest. This year had been incredibly busy for him, and he just needed a break. I for one had fun playing with the kids in the water. I was really in touch with my inner child on that vacation.",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H08Z06A,0.0

We hear of them and read about them in newspapers almost daily. Such accidents often result in lose of life and material. These are caused by the carelessness of the drivers and their ignorance and negligence of the traffic rules. A few days ago I returned from Pennsylvania where I visited my brother. He had just got his driving licence and had just started to drive on his own without an instructor sitting together with him in the car. Unfortunately we had two accidents during our 4-day stay. Luckily no one was injured, but the car was partly damaged, especially at the second time. I'll tell you the story of the 2nd accident in brief ""We got off the highway and entered a country road leading to our summer house. We were driving at a speed of nearly 40 km/h and saw a railway bridge ahead of us. The road narrowed under the bridge we had to pass. We were expected to before the bridge, but my brother didn't notice the warning sign since it was hidden by a tree. We had to give way to a big truck coming from the opposite direction but didn't due my brother's failure to notice the sign. When we saw the truck approaching us, we abruptly slammed on the brakes and my brother turned the steering to the right thinking was a lane there, but actually that was the lane for traffic in the opposite direction and as a result our car hit the sidewalk right under the bridge and it stopped after the collision. Luckily we didn't collide head-on with the truck. The right tyre burst, the rim was dented, but the biggest problem was the front steering column, which broke into two parts. However, there was a car service centre right near the place of our accident and they helped us repair the car so that we could drive home"".",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H2X406V,0.0

We had been leading up to this event for a long time. She became very nervous. At night she would tell me that she didn't want to go to kindergarten.  I think her nervousness came from our nervousness. She is our first born, and this was a monumental event in her life. She had gone to preschool, but this felt very different. We tried to do things to make her more excited.  we took her shopping for back-to-school clothes. She did get a little excited about that. We also had an informal event at the school, so she got a chance to look at the school and the things in the classroom. I made sure to take the day off, so that I could help take her to school and be there when she got home.  we got to the classroom, and she found it in and seemed to be having a great time. Before we even got to the school, we took a lot of pictures of her. We took pictures of her on our porch, and pictures of her in front of the school. It was very moving to see her so grown up and ready to go to school. After school that day, she came home. She came through the door and threw her arms up in the air and told us that she loved kindergarten. It was so relieving to know that she had had a good time. In some ways it was more moving hearing how excited she was about the day, then it had been watching her leave to go to kindergarten.

They first thought he needed a pacemaker, then his vitals began crashing and they thought he had a stroke. We were lucky that it turned out that one of his medications were causing issues. Once they stopped it, he began to improve. I was at his side at every moment, communicating with family and being his advocate when he couldn't communicate. I helped feed him and move him around. It was extremely daunting. Up at about 6AM every morning, go to the hospital and just wait. Then go home around 8PM, hoping he would be with us the next day.

This was nearly 4 months ago, and is still pretty fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good day, which started bright and early at 7 am for me and my friends. I had to get to the hair salon at 8am to get ready for hair and makeup. My friends were all tired, and I was as well. Mostly because I was super anxious and ready to get married finally. But it all went smoothly, and we were done in about 3 hours. We still had time to kill, so we went to grab lunch nearby. Then shortly after that we got ready to head to the church to finish getting ready for the wedding. Now that part was chaotic. My dad lost or misplaced parts of his suit rental. And, my dress which had fit previously the week before, was not closing up properly. Go figure, I ended up having to be sewed into my dress. Then it came time to get married finally. And all of the stress and anxiety went away the moment I saw my husband finally. It went very smoothly, even though our friend dropped our wedding rings. We said our vows and all that. And then after the ceremony was over we headed to the after party. There are alot of cherished memories that come along with that day. And, I'll never forget it.",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCX8WQ0,0.0

""There is a slight gas leak under the sidewalk in front of your property,"" he said. ""We discovered it May 31st. A crew will come do the repair around July 15th."" My eyebrow went up. He saw it, and added, ""it's a very, very small leak, so it's ok to wait. We use a machine that can detect parts per million. Yours is something like 5 parts per million."" Should I trust them? This gas company was the one responsible for the San Bruno explosion in 2010, and also the Northern California wildfires last year. This company is bankrupt and owes something like $20 billion. Maybe they are being more proactive now in looking for leaks to avoid more lawsuits. But should I trust them? What option do I have? I'm no expert. July 15th was a long time to wait. Would I get blown up if Fourth Of July fireworks set off the gas? No, no, he assured me. This guy seemed to know what he was doing. Ok, I'll wait. The following week the little colored flags were planted to mark the gas lines, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV line, and water pipe, very colorful to match the American flags on Independence Day. Tick tock. Tick tock. Nerves were just beneath the surface. Finally the day came, and they showed up in force with several huge trucks with digging equipment. It took them from 8:30 am till 8 pm to plug the leak. Sigh of relief all around.",3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCTQ7QWW,,0.0

She was having trouble walking. Just yesterday she had seemed just fine. I immediately called our normal vet, who luckily had time to see my precious dog that very same day. I rushed her over to the vet. At first she thought it could be a pinched nerve or even simple dehydration. But she ordered an x-ray and my worst fears came true. My beautiful, loving, caring, spirited, wonderful, amazing dog had cancer. She had not one but three tumors on her spinal cord. The vet advised us that even with surgery, cancer in this location, these size tumors and multiple tumors had a very poor prognosis. Since my dog is twelve, my vet did not think we should operate. I made the painful choice not to do the surgery. I took my dog home and for the next week we pampered her, showered her with love and affection and gave her the best week of her life. After the week was over, we called a different vet, one that does house calls, because I wanted my dog to be put to sleep at home where she was comfortable. The vet came over and, surrounded by family, my companion for the past twelve years was put to sleep. I will never forget my precious dog, and I still miss her every day, but I keep on moving because I know that life and death are intertwined and it's something we all have to deal with and accept.",,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N94G4XPT,0.0

It was about a month ago, we went out sailing on the Atlantic off the coast of Florida around 6 AM. It had been a while since we have gone fishing, we used to go all the time back when I was a kid. Sadly, time catches up to us all, and my school work and his job have kept us from it. The morning was a slow one, didn't get as much as a bite until around noon. Both my father and I had caught a couple trout, enough to make a decent dinner but nothing too out of the ordinary. I had almost hooked a tarpon, but it managed to break the line and swim off with my hook. We stayed passing the time out on the sea for a few more hours, before my dad checked his watch. We both realized the sun was setting soon and it would be time to cook our fish. Closer to time to head back to shore, my dad had a huge pull on his line that nearly took the pole with him. It took us both to reel it in but to our surprise it wound up being a bull shark! We pulled and got it all the way up to our boat before we finally let him go and agreed to head back to shore. It was a fun day that I will never forget. I'd like to go fishing with my dad again someday. Maybe I'll call him today and ask.",,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N95KAPX0,0.0

Had made sure to leave food for the animals back at home being that we would be gone for a while. we also went with friends and family. Few hours later we were on the road on our way. It didn't take that long to get there maybe about 2 hours. we spent most of our time hanging out on the white sandy beaches. building sand castles and riding the waves in the water. it was fun indeed while it lasted.

Things took a dark turn when she got pregnant. I know that hormones can get pretty crazy, but let me tell you, crazy was a complete understatement. I was no saint. I knew nothing of how to deal with mood swings and hormonal imbalances. I would yell, get angry, and overall most of the time just make the situation worse. I never knew how to act almost. I did my best but my very best just wasn't good enough. She would yell constantly. And so would I. Fights were back and forth screaming matches. It got slightly better after the baby was born. I was finally a dad. We were finally a family together. Her and I split up a few months after the baby was born. It turned out that not everything was perfect sunshine and rainbows.

The day started out with my niece and I going to IHOP to get breakfast.  She loves pancakes so IHOP was the perfect place for her to eat.  We both had a large stack of pancakes and left the restaurant feeling great.  After breakfast we went to a early movie.  The Lion King was playing and she really wanted to see it.  Since I had seen the original I thought it would be interesting to take her to see the new version.  I bought the tickets and we went in and got popcorn and drinks.  We found some seats in the middle of the theater and sat back to enjoy the movie.  The movie was really good and brought back memories from my childhood.  My niece also loved the movie.  It was now mid afternoon and we decide to go to the skating rink.  Both her and I like to skate so it was a good way to pass the time.  After about a 20 minute drive we arrived at the rink and noticed that the parking lot was not too full.  That was good because it would mean the rink had less people on it and more space to skate.  We went inside and rented our skates.  We spent the next three hours blissfully skating in a nice oval direction.  The music was good and it was not that crowded so the experience was really nice.  When skating I never seem to get tired.  I think it is because I enjoy it so much.  When we left the skating rink it was late afternoon and we were hungry so I took her to Chi Fil A to get some sandwiches.  She loves that restaurant.  We took the food home and waited for her father to get off work.  After eating the food and spending time with her father my niece fell asleep on the couch.  It had been a long fun day.,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7VZ19L8,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7VZ19L8,0.0

The day was bright and sunny but felt chilly for summer. We went planning to see the animals, pick apples, ride the wagon. This year they added a big jump pad for the kids to play in! When we go there we played in the little wood houses they have first, then went to the yearly wagon ride! On the wagon ride the guide told us all about the farm and how much water it takes, how many apples they produce, and all sorts of information. After the wagon ride we were able to get lost in the corn maze, they added fun trivia to help point you in the right way this year. Then at the exit we were able to jump on the giant pumpkin pad. We of course gathered a bag of apple to bring home. The kids loved eating the fresh apples instead of bagging them. The little one was able to ride around on my solders while we walked around eating our apples. They also took away the pedal bike races and replaced it with a mine shaft play area where you could purchase bags of sand with gems. To finish up our day we looks at the animals, we saw little pigs, lamas, goats, and lots of other farm animals. We will probably be back again in the next couple weeks to go play for a while. I can not wait to go next year and see what else they add!",,3JBT3HLQF9OF8A5FOSR7MR3KF95PZA,0.0

It was the largest group I've ever gone camping with, and I was nervous about how it would go. Lucky for me, the two women who planned the trip were very thorough and considerate. The food was plentiful and delicious. There were more than enough tents to house everyone. The kayaks and paddle boards we rented were firmly secured and easily made the trip into the mountains. The two trucks we took also managed to cart us and our equipment without complaining. They're both old, so I had been worried about that.    I grew up in a pretty inactive family. We went camping a lot when I was little, but didn't actually do outdoor activities. Then my dad's back started to bother him, and we stopped camping. Last year I went camping again for the first time in over a decade and slept terribly. Thankfully, my body got over that during a week-long river rafting trip in April. It helps that I now have the right equipment and mindset to successfully sleep while camping.   This was my first time on both a kayak and a paddle board. I enjoyed both, but I loved the single-seat kayak. I want to buy one now. I live near a lake, but I don't have a reliable way to transport a kayak, so it'll have to wait for a bit. The reason I chose to journal about this trip was that it's a testament to the growth that I and my friends have made in the last couple of years. I used to be terrified of trying anything new, especially anything physical. I'm not afraid to test the limits of my body anymore. I know I can handle a lot more than I used to think I could, and I know that it's okay to not be great at something the first time you try it. And my friends and siblings have flourished into full-fledged adults. It was an enjoyable, fortifying experience. I hope we do it again soon.",,3JCG6DTRV4CRUU5319NJV3HQDD8QQU,0.0

My best friend had his bachelor party. We decided to have a fairly tame night out at a popular local bar with all our closest friends in attendance. It was a very cool night out compared to the hot weather we had been having. When we got to the bar we all played several rounds of pool and ordered several rounds of bourbon.  We had a lot of fun just sharing stories and playing games. It was such a memorable night due to the simplicity of it. We rarely all get together like that anymore and the focus was on having a good time. We had a pretty large bill by the end of the night and were entirely too drunk. I had to call a cab to get us all back to his apartment. From there we ordered a pizza and fired up some old games.  We must have played until at least five in the morning when the last of us had finally dozed off. The next day we were up early for the weeding and we had to scatter back to our places to get ready.  The wedding was was outdoors at a local winery.  It was such a nice morning and it felt good to breathe in the fresh air. The ceremony was simple and everyone was elated. I remember the bride’s slim yet long white dress and the rows of pristine white chairs. I was best man and was very nervous having to stand up in front of all those people I didn’t know. My friend was so confident when he spoke of his love to her. I felt happy just to be there in that moment. After the ceremony the music started right away and we all began to enjoy the wine provided. My friend said I didn’t have to give a speech but I decided it would be a good idea to say a few kind words and toast to the new marriage. It was a short nerve racking moment; however, it seemed to be received well We watched as they had their first dance and then hit the floor ourselves. It was kind of sad because I realized that he would have a lot less time for us at this point forward. They were moving to a new city and he would be starting a new job.",,3JJVG1YBECJFX2KGYZ2Q23R0P1H5BF,0.0

My therapist says it will be good for me, I guess. Two months ago, my mother died. Sometimes I feel numb to it, like it happened to someone else, and I'm just watching my suffering through a television screen. My therapist says that's called ""dissociating"" and it's ""bad."" Anyway. My mother was all so stubborn. I've kind of hit the anger part of grief. Where I wish she would have just listened to us when we said the migraines weren't normal, and for a woman like my mom to be bedridden for days in pain was not normal. She never listened until that day. Seizures in the kitchen, collapsing. My father calling to hospital, only because she was too sick to say no at that point... She only lived for three months after that day. They did scans of her brain around the clock, while my father and I shared wooden and metal benches to sleep on, waking up only to see if there was any news. Once we got the news, they told us she would die soon. I couldn't take it, her laying there, lifeless and empty. The same woman who danced me around the kitchen to Elton John and Stevie Nicks, now laying lifeless incapable of the most basic human tasks. I begged my father to pull the plug on the day before her last, crying hysterically. He was trying to hang on to her, she was suffering, she was never coming back, the cancer had spread too far. When she died, her lifeless face broke into somewhat of a smile and her eyes sealed like a tomb, or maybe that's just the grief talking.",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKDRUEVB,0.0

During their performance, I found myself singing along to all of their songs and dancing with other members of the crowd. While I did not know anyone else in the crowd, I felt a oneness with them, as we were all fans of the band and knew all of the songs by heart. I had had two beers before the concert, but the euphoria I felt while dancing with other fans was a different sort of intoxication that did not require alcohol at all. We jumped, sang our lungs out, and stepped back and forth frantically. When the singer needed us to clap, stomp, or carry the tune, we obliged. The night passed by in a flash as our adrenaline and sweat flowed like water. It was the most fun I had had in a while. I had sung and shouted so much that my voice was gone the next morning. It made me think about seeing another band at that venue in the near future. This was the closest thing to a religious experience that I had had happen to me. Short of converting to a religion, another event like this was my best shot at feeling it again. I will always remember this night as one where I joined with complete strangers to appreciate our favorite band. As we walked out into the lobby, we lined up to buy band merchandise.

Her music has been incredibly important to me for many years, basically since I was a young teenager. The tickets were a wonderful surprise from my partner. I had told my partner she was coming to a city about an hour away from us, but that I didn't have the money for tickets and that I was gutted that I would miss it.  It was surely going to a memorable tour experience, as she was playing solo in small, intimate venues which is unusual. The day the tickets were released my partner grabbed some before they sold out, took me to dinner that night, and told me there. I was so happy I cried in the restaurant! Anyway, the day of the show my partner was gracious enough to drive over to the venue two hours before the doors opened so we would be sure to get a good seat. We waited in the cold, I was so excited time flew by. The venue was a gorgeous old church, with the audience sitting in pews. We got some drinks and sat around for an hour, and then the lights dimmed. I almost couldn't contain myself, I felt as though I was going to burst. The artist came on, and immediately launched into my very favorite song! Which she never plays live! I was stunned, and immediately began crying. The rest of the show was equally as beautiful and touching. Her voice was transcendent, soaring into the eaves of the church. The experience was absolutely indescribable. I've never been to a concert like this one. I couldn't believe what a great show it was. I cried through most of it.",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKMLEVE9,0.0

There were plenty of bedrooms for everyone so both my parents and my inlaws came along, along with our kids and some of their friends.  We all wanted to get out on the water and we rented some kayaks to use while we there.  Everyone was taking turns and having fun but my mother-in-law refused to try it.  Finally after a lot of pushing by just about everyone, she finally decided to give it a try.  It was so funny she was really pretty freaked out about the entire thing.  But she got in the kayak just fine and managed to have some fun kayaking along the shoreline.  It was hard not to laugh when she finished.  She got back to the dock and just stared at all of us.  She couldn't figure out the best way to climb back out of the kayak!  Some grandkids went over to help her.  They essentially had to pull her out.  We all got a good laugh out of it, even her.

Nothing came of it however, because she was dating another guy. I was also too preoccupied with my extracurricular activities to really date at the time. I don't think we ever had a meaningful conversation in high school. I started talking to her, for lack of anything else to do during the wedding. To my surprise, it turned out that she was also attracted to me in high school. She never acted on it because she was loyal to her boyfriend at the time.

My husband and I were at my sister-in-laws house for a family gathering.  My brother and sister-in-law had recently bought a beautiful, large home, with a pool, which now made it the place for parties.  However, they didn't have the pool enclosed with a cage at this time.  My little nephew was, however, enrolled in a swim class to teach infants life saving maneuvers, so it didn't seem like that big of a risk to have the pool open.  At some point during the party, my nephew quietly slipped into the pool without any adult noticing.  His father found him face down in the water and everyone began to panic.  My mother-in-law, a ARNP, began CPR as my husband called 911.  All efforts were pointless.  No one was sure how long he had been face down in the pool, but there was no resuscitating him.  Understandably, my sister-in-law has not been well since.  I, myself, struggle with it daily still.  How could I have not heard or noticed him?  The guilt haunts me and is almost unbearable.  I cannot imagine what my sister-in-laws feels like.

I began by exercising, self-coaching, and making changes to my finances. My health was something that simply went out of control. I gained so much weight and my blood pressure was high. To make matters worse, I began exhibiting sleep apnea. I would snore and choke at the same time, sometimes waking up my kids and resulting in an abbreviated sleep. If didn't make lifestyle changes soon, my weight, exacerbated by my stress, would end my life. Everyday I exercised, I also practice mindful meditation. I spent a few minutes in silence thinking about what I was thankful for and my commitment towards achieving my financial goals. The exercise and meditation reduced the physical and mental effects of my daily stress. A major part of my daily stress has been finances. I've been riding the edge due to my bankruptcy, sometimes barely having enough for utilities. I've been doing my best, however, from falling off that edge by taking up side jobs and selling things. I've also had to ask for help from friends, swallowing my pride for the sake of electricity.

To me it was a memorable experience because I thought about when I moved into college 11 years ago. I remember driving down there with him and our parents and the whole process just brought back a lot of memories. It started with helping load the car with his things and carrying everything up to his dorm room. There were hundreds of students moving in and the campus yard was huge. Looking at the dorm room itself was especially nostalgic because of the double beds and the desk that looked exactly like the one I had in college. I felt like my brother was more creative with decorating than I was because he wanted to hand lights above his bed and put up nice pictures. My mother was being how she always is with making sure that everything was in order and asking him if he had everything he needed along with helping him make his bed and put away his stuff. He had this really fluffy white rug beside his bed and his bed sheets and comforter looked really comfortable. He also had a ""bed in a suitcase"" thing that I didn't have when I moved into college. I helped him hang his lights and even took a photo and kept comparing how it was for me moving into college and how my process wasn't as big due to the fact that the school I attended was smaller and there weren't as many students. It was weird leaving because he didn't seem like he would be homesick and he was ready to just start doing what he needs to do without us around. I felt really old and like I was the parent, which is why it was so weird. I even remember my mother saying that if he needs things he will have to go to the store himself, which is the first step to independence because I remember myself when I moved and needed to walk to the store.

She has been looking forward to this wedding for her whole life, it's literally the only thing she was ever taught to care about. They had a beautiful ceremony. It was amazing. I am so happy that she was able to live out her bourgeois fantasy of having everyone show up to give her attention for getting married. I had such a good time and it made me love our culture. These are people who have absolutely no understanding of contemporary politics, all they know is Disney fantasies. It is good that they are able to shield themselves from reality. My sister thinks it's self indulgent. She's wrong. She's some kind of political activist or something. Anyway, the wedding was amazing! I love weddings!! I am SO HAPPY FOR MY SON!

I was sure that day that it was going to be bad because my wife kept nagging me about buying a car around that week. We argued a lot in the morning up until around lunch time. It was a very hard and long debate because it was an argument mainly because of how she is very incompetent in buying the best deal for a used car. Honestly, my point to her was that it is extremely important to look into a car and find anything that could have brought the price down of the car, because not most of the time that there is a car that is too much good of a deal. She definitely got mad at me for trying to lecture her. It was just one of those days that no matter how much truth I speak out to her, it comes into her ears as noise. It was a good thing that by afternoon she kind of calm down. She actually tried and did her research when she took her time in the time she was just alone. She surprised me and as soon as she tried to convince me when she informed me all the details of this car, and after that, I was definitely convinced. We went to the car dealership, and I was so happy for her because she figured it out on her own. I do have my way of trying to talk down to her and I definitely asked for forgiveness from her and promised to avoid doing that. I was proud of her because she followed the steps I was trying to show her. We bought the car because it was definitely the best affordable used car available, without any glaring issues. Sometimes, I should definitely try to remind myself that things need to calm down first, instead of rushing to a quick fix.",3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMEWJNB7,,0.0

The baby was so tiny I was so scared to hold the baby once I was allowed because I was afraid I might break something on him. While pregnant my  doctor told me I should get an abortion because my baby more than likely had down syndrome. She told me they could administer a test that would let me know for sure if he in fact had down syndrome. The test involved sticking a needle into my stomach and retrieving fluid from the wound to diagnose the baby. The problem was that if I agreed to the test it would increase the chances of the baby actually having down syndrome. It didn't make any sense to me because I figured I didn't need to know if the baby had it or not because I would love him no matter the circumstances. Fast forward to 4 months ago and I feel a sharp pain while on the toilet at home, I immediately call 911 and get into ambulance. By time i made it to a room and they went and got the doctor the baby was already out. he was 3 months earlier than his due date. I could tell right away that the baby did not have down syndrome but I wasn't particularly worried about that I was more concerned about if he was breathing and yes, indeed he was. he fought his way through the NICU and came after only two months. He will have some developmental delays besides the ones that are obvious from being premature but overall I am just happy that I have my baby and love him to death. he is a joy.",,3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHY00KWW3,0.0

I agreed with him and then proceeded to call 911. I told the operator what happened and I waited for the authorities to arrive. The police and ambulance arrived about five minutes after i called them and the driver started to get out of his truck.

After hearing some stories about how people are actually making impact just by using podcast as a means to share their honest view of various issue and people are actually willing to listen to it. I decided to listen to one, so I had my friend recommend one for me about 2 months ago, and he did. I tuned in after getting home from work, at first I did not get the idea but once I paid attention I realized what every was saying. I became a regular listeners of that podcast. A month later I was laid off at my job, I guess due to restructuring. I had nothing to do I was just at home all day everyday sleeping and eating, and maybe go out with my friends once in a while. At one of those outings I met the voice behind my favorite podcast and he told me how he got started. I decided to give it a shot, and then I did some research for about a week. I had no reason not to, no job, just bills to pay. 2 weeks ago I went live, I only had a few listeners, with few regular downloads at first. About 5 downloads to be precise and they were all my friends I suspected. One day I was just frustrated and I started ranting about my former job. This rant attracted people, I was amazed.

I did tons of research.  I listen to to ther podcasts every day.  I study the great football podcasters.  When it was time to do my own podcast, I knew exactly what to do.  I knew my first post had to be exciting.  I made it about one of my favorite quarterbacks.  The podcast ended up getting a lot of views.  Many people commented on it.

He turned 3 years old.  It was a lovely event with several kids who came to play at the party, and then a small handful of adults.  It was laid back.  They decided to try to get the birthday cake last minute, and it took several hours for them to find a place that could bake a cake last minute.  While we were served dinner, it was quite late by the time we were able to eat because we had to wait until the cake arrived before we could eat.  But, eventually it did arrive and we ate dinner together.  Next, my nephew decided it was time to start opening presents.  He started without telling anyone, and his parents were out of the room when he started.  They were surprised to find that he opened almost all of his presents before they were able to watch him.  We all laughed at his eagerness to open the gifts!  I think he wanted to open the gifts because he was most excited about eating the cake, and wanted to be able to do that as soon as possible.  He blew out his candle and immediately started picking off the cake decorations and icing and eating it.  The cake was quickly pulled away, so he wouldn't eat all of the toppings.  At the end, we were each served a slice of cake.  It was a very enjoyable afternoon/evening.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9AZV3GFL,0.0

My biological dad left when I was a baby so my step-dad was pretty much the sole father figure in my life during some of my formative years (around age four to nine). This was until he and my mom unfortunately got divorced. He still tried to be there for me but life got in the way. He and I drifted apart over time. So my step-dad apparently got my phone number from my mom and gave me an unexpected call one day several months ago. I said how good it was to hear from him, and we updated each other on some of the new mundane things in our lives. He also told me about his health, which he's had issues with at times, but on the whole things are going pretty well for him especially considering he's in his 70s. I shared news about my own health which has also had some bumps in the road. He told me he has a new wife who he said is great and he's very happy being with. The memorable and rather shocking part of the story was when that my step-dad told me his younger sister had died (only in her 50s) far too soon from cancer. I was really quite sad and taken aback by this. It brought up a lot of memories from my childhood of staying over at her house and how nice she was. I of course tried my best to offer my condolences and sympathy. It was a nice conversation and moving experience that lasted about half an hour. At the end of the call we expressed intent to stay in touch, which we have. It's been good to have him back in my life even in just a small way.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ55D9UC,,0.0

I like him very much because he is very naughty and funny. And also because he has the same birth date as mine! Let me tell you something more about him. He is ten years old and has big mischievous eyes and curly brown hair. His favourite food is masala data and he loves to cat ice-creams. He runs very fast and always wins lots of medals for his school. He is the captain of his school athletics team, lie also loves to read books, watch movies and play video games. John stays in Newyork and visits us in the summer holidays every year. When he visited us last year, we had a lot of lint by joining a swimming camp and taking guitar lessons together. I am very excited because my mother has promised that John.  I can celebrate our birthday this year by throwing one big party for all our friends. I have so much fun whenever John visits that I sometimes wish that he stayed near us so that I could him meet him every day and we could study in the same school together! I will continue enjoying my funny cousin until everybody else gets what he is saying.

It was a great move across the entire country, I was basically uprooting my entire life and replanting in a brand new state. So, of course, I had to bring my turtley son along with. I put him into a shoebox with some airholes and a towel to keep him comfy. He wasn't happy about his travel arrangements, though, and kept trying to dig his way out. Poor guy. Sorry lil buddy. He did get to meet the TSA, who allowed him to bypass the x ray machine. (I was worried about health effects for my boy!) But they had to check his box, and insisted on swabbing it for explosives. Or maybe drugs? They found none, of course, except the ADDICTIVE AND EXPLOSIVELY CUTE personality of my turt. He charmed the TSA instantly and though they finished swabbing within a minute, they spent five or six cooing over my boy. Once in the terminal, he continued to charm my fellow passengers, and got a lot of pets. The rest of the trip was less eventful. He'd attempt to burrow his way out every once in a while, but I let him peek out whenever I was sitting between flights, and the new sights and smells seemed to satisfy some curiosity. It was only when the box was closed that he tried to dig his way to freedom. Once we got to our new home, he sulked in a corner of his tank for a week. But he quickly returned to his good natured, turtley self once he realized there was a whole new world to explore now just outside! This is going to be his home for years to come. He's hopefully never going to have to travel by plane again, and I think he's more than okay with that.",3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ2EVAG5,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ2EVAG5,0.0

My mom and I have tried for years to get on my sister's good side and nothing seemed to work. We just got used to the fact that she pretty much cut us out of her life. One day, though, we were invited over to her house. It was a big surprise since she never really did that before unless she needed someone to babysit. We were expecting her to still be quiet and not answer our questions or even really talk to us, but we were wrong. She showed emotion and interest in us for once. She made dinner, but I don't remember what it was. I don't remember what we talked about,. I'm sure my niece was there, but I also don't remember what her whole role was. We just had a good time with her for the first time in a long time. When we left, my mom said how surprised she was that that just happened. It sounds weird because this is such a normal thing for everyone else, but we really were very confused and surprised. I think prior to going we thought there was bad news, but there wasn't.

We were just having a simple family party, but we were taking it to the next level.  I wanted to make it fun and lively.  I purchased a bunch of pink flamingo decor to decorate the walls and tables.  I purchased a cute flamingo puffy straw to adorn the party cups.  I played music by Marshmello, who is her favorite musician.  For her gifts, I purchased her a bunch of squishes, and some play make up.  We had all of her cousins come, which totaled about 10 kids.  We had games like pinata hitting, hula hoop competition, and limbo.  Her cake I decorated pink and purple with many pastel colored sprinkles.  This birthday was a large celebration as she has always dreamed of having a horse again.  Unfortunately, our property is small and we could no longer afford the board in our area for a horse.  So, we sold the one we had years ago.  This year, I was able to gift her with something that most people wouldn't even think would matter to a young girl.  I was able to tell her we were buying a house out in the country that had enough acreage for a horse!  She was over the moon excited.  Our little half acre lot that we lived in would eventually turn into 10 acres in our new home.  She would have the room to ride and play like she had always dreamt of doing.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,0.0

She was 7 months along when the doctor lost the heartbeat. We met her at the hospital  where she was induced. About 4 hours later her little baby was born. It was really hard, we cried and prayed together. Her faith has helped her get through it. She and her husband are being strong for each other and their other two kids. She understands that faith in God makes hard things possible. She wrote us about it and quoted this from one of our church leaders: This is a vivid illustration of the truth expressed by President Russell M. Nelson: “When the focus of our lives is on … Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening﻿—or not happening﻿—in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him."" She has helped us through this as much as we have helped her. She has reminded us that everyone’s situation is different, and the details of each life are unique. Nevertheless, I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives. There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious. We can be grateful! We are trying to live that way.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80B4A8HE8,,0.0

It was a blast! The hotel we stayed in was really modern and great, it had a lot of art around the grounds that we went and looked at. Most specifically there was a guitar that used to be owned by Roy Orbison that my husband was super excited about. We spent some time watching his favorite movie in this really crazy state of the art theater. The movie we watched was an Anime film that I didn't like, but wow was it great in that theater! We had a really nice time swimming and really enjoyed it, it was great exercise. The restaurant was fantastic and served us great steak. It was wild because normally he only likes the steak I make for him, but this time he really enjoyed it. It made me feel self conscious and that I had to do better the next time I make steak. The most memorable thing we did was drink a little too much and get into the whirlpool tub. At first it felt really great but after a little while we began to feel woozy. When we got out, we felt very dizzy and sick to our stomachs. We had to go lay down. Neither of us felt that we'd drank that much, but I guess we were wrong! Next time we will be careful not to do such a thing.",,3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX75HES,0.0

Since he enjoys staying at hotels, I booked a room at a luxury hotel for a weekend getaway. I did not tell him before we checked-in to the hotel, but I had chosen this hotel because it had a large, heated indoor pool. We got to our room and I immediately opened my suitcase and pulled out his swimming trunks, that I had packed in secret.  We changed into our swim clothes and headed down to the pool. As we approached the pool, we both noticed that there was also a whirlpool located next to the pool. I was elated! My husband suffers from back pain and the whirlpool would certainly made him feel good. We swam for quite a while, then relaxed in the whirlpool. After we got back to our room, we both were extremely hungry and we agreed that a steak dinner was what we wanted. We ate our favorite steaks along with baked potatoes and creamed spinach.  For dessert, my both had the most delicious chocolate cake that we'd ever eaten. After dinner, I gave him directions to a nearby movie theater, where we planned to see a remake of one of his favorite movies, The Lion King. The theater featured state of the art video and sound, but when we entered the theater to take our seats, I was astonished to see that all of the seats were overstuffed leather recliners that changed position with the touch of a button. Again, this made me particularly happy because of my husband's back issues, sitting for long periods of time can be painful for him. I was sure that he would be very comfortable in his seat and would be able to enjoy the movie thoroughly, which he was and he did.  The sound and video quality, along with the comfort of the seats made us decide that we would never go to different theater ever again. All in all, the weekend was a great success because my husband had a fantastic time.",3K772S5NP9XPKYGV9S5PS80BX75HES,,0.0

I expected a large screen and fantastic sound, but what I did not expect were the seats...overstuffed leather electric recliners that adjusted to just about every position imaginable. My husband was overjoyed at the comfort of the seats because he suffers from back pain and I felt so happy that I had chosen a theater that would allow him to see this special movie in such a memorable way. The sound was incredible, not even close to the sound experience in the movie theater we usually frequent. After the movie, my husband could not stop talking about the movie itself and the overall experience of seeing it in this type of theater. We decided at that moment that we would not wish to see a movie anywhere else, ever again.

This is day will be remembered forever. It was something like the movie Hangover, but without the extra. It happened about a month ago, my friend parents had went on vacation for about two weeks. My friend decided to throw a party for his three closest friends; to celebrate our 22nd birthday. Since none of us had a birthday party this year, and we where born the same year. My friend said be at his crib around 8 and bring some liquor and call some girls. So i called a few girls, and posted it on a blog post. I arrived to my friend crib around 8 , it was kind of dark outside but wasn't fully dark in which the moon was at its glory. Walked inside and saw it was a small amount of people inside. I would say about 20 people in total. The music was very smooth, like a nice slow jam to dance with the ladies.  I shook three of my friends hands, and gave four girls i knew a hug. More people started to arrive and that's when everything got lit. About 40 more people arrived and that's when the heavy liquor came in. People brought in Hennessy, Ciroc and other expensive drinks i haven't heard of. Let me tell you, we got wasted that night. I was taking shots, after shots, after shots, and more shots. I think I had about 10 shots of liquor, for what i can remember. All i remember was i threw up all over my friends couch, table, and bathroom toilet. But that didn't stop the party, we party until about 4 a.m.. It was a night to remember. I woke up the next morning with the worst hangover ever and barely remembering anything. I end up staying at my friends crib cause i was so wasted. He showed me the video of me throwing up and dancing with a couple of girls. We laughed about it and then i went home.",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRPVTLNX,0.0

Instead of all going out to dinner like we usually do, we just decided to have a party with some friends. We all drank a ton of alcohol and went a little crazy. There were a bunch of people I didn't really know but that didn't matter to me much. The party overall was a blur to me. There are some parts that I remember slightly and some that I just don't remember at all. The most memorable event of the party was going home with my girlfriend. That part was better then most of the party and I enjoyed it 10x more than anything else really. We ate somewhere after and I enjoyed that meal a lot. After we went to my place and did some other fun stuff. It was much more better than me throwing up in the bathroom. It was significant to me because it was my 22nd birthday and I had a really enjoyable time with my girlfriend after that will stick with me for years to come. It also showed me new things that I enjoyed. I think that going home was the better option than staying at the party. I think my girlfriend played a big role in this event.",3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRPVTLNX,,0.0

She is enjoying the ride and looking out the window. The bus then abruptly stops and she was thrown forward in her seat. Fred then walks on to the bus and sees, that the only seat left is the one next to Daisy. Fred sat down with a huff and he began to make himself comfortable. The bus then began to move and they were back on the road. For the next hour of the ride, Daisy was looking out the window until, Fred turns to her and says that his name is Fred. This takes Daisy by surprise and causes Daisy to become a little more happy about the whole thing. Even though it was a better reaction,than she got the first time she still did not trust Fred so she just ignored him. She waited about 10 minutes and felt bad for avoiding Fred so she turned his way. She suddenly notice that he was sleeping before she could asking him a few questions. With this now known, Daisy happily fell asleep knowing that she had made a new friend. A half an hour later, Daisy woke up to the sound of the road. Daisy sat up straight and found Fred reading his newspaper. Throughout art history there have been many artists who refer back to mythological figures and tales as artistic inspiration. Mythological stories, as well as the ideas of classic history, became increasingly reverted back to with the start of Neoclassicism. Rationality and tradition were rediscovered and implemented into artwork more frequently in the mid-eighteenth century; these key thoughts made up the ideals of Neoclassicism; the classical revival in European art. One of the great artists of the time was Baron Francois Gerard, whose oil painting of Cupid and Psyche in 1798 represented a true masterpiece of the Neoclassical period due to its overall focus on the main characters in the narrative while integrating powerful symbolism and creating a high quality of realism. Baron Francois Gerard’s 1798 painting of Cupid and Psyche portrays Psyche sitting on a grassy hill-like area. She is shown with a very vacant and far-off gaze as if observing something in the distance. Her posture is relaxed yet her arms are almost in a folded position over her bare body. Cupid is right next to her and has his arms wrapped around her carefully as to not touch her. His gaze is right at her face and has a look of longing in his eyes. Cupid carries his set of arrows around his right arm between his golden falcon wings.",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRYWYLND,0.0

He turned 3 and I really wanted to make it special for him. My wife and I tried to figure out what to do for a week straight. We live in a fairly boring part of Florida so we really struggled for ideas. We came up with the idea to play some YouTube video's featuring the places we could go to. We showed him Weeki Wachee Springs, Universal Studio's, Disney, Lowrey Park Zoo, MOSI, and Islands of Adventure. He didn't seem interested in any of these places surprisingly. But while we were watching a video of Clearwater Beach an ad for Chuck E Cheese came on and his curiosity piqued. Then for the next few days that was all he could talk about. On the day of his birthday we gave him a ton of presents, and after we were done we took a ride in the car without telling him where we were going. He kept talking about it on the way there, but we kept it a secret. When we pulled into the parking lot he was so thrilled and we couldn't have been happier.

I was fortunate enough to be able to stay at my boyfriends house and get a few online jobs. I also was able to get in contact with my real dad who is currently moving back to Dallas to buy a house so he can help me get my life back together. I haven't seen my mom in about 5 months, I refuse to, she make my skin itch and I don't wanna be around her anymore. My mom's boyfriend and her are staying at my grandmas house full time with my little sister and niece. He also refuses to get a job because he says his money is still coming and it's any day now. Now no one in my family likes him except my mom, he thought he would reach out and bother me everyday with long text messages and phone calls every 10 minutes. Him and my mom also tried to convince me not to go live with my real dad and that they can offer me a better life. They are both so high up the others butt it's sad, but not sad enough for me to go see them. My life took a turn back in October, i went clubbing with my best friend and was drinking and dancing the night away. The next day I woke up and felt a real sharp pain in my leg and a liquid leaving my body, turns out I had been pregnant and was having a miscarriage. I went through that for about a week and was really low in my life, I had realized that I really had nothing to call my own. I didn't tell anyone but my best friend and my boyfriend, I couldn't bare to tell anyone in my family, I just couldn't bare it. I still talk to my mom on the phone from time to time and she wants to talk to me in person about her boyfriend and whether I like him or not. This is one of the reason I refuse to see her, she only cares about him and me being away from my dad, another reason is her constant lies she's been telling that have come out. I don't wanna get into exactly what she lied about, but I hate liars and it was enough for me to look at her differently. The only upside is that my relationship is stronger than ever, we're actually thinking about building a tiny house and travelling the USA. He wants to get married but I want to wait a few more years after we get our degrees.",3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTBHVI39,,0.0

This includes getting tests that older adults must get to detect any issues they may have. About a week ago, I went to the doctor for a routine prostate exam. I had never done a test like this so I was nervous to begin with. After the test, the doctor and I sat down to go over the results. During this conversation, the doctor informed me I was at high risk of prostate cancer. This, of course, caught me completely off guard. Immediately I was overcome with fear and anxiety. Thoughts of my children and family instantly flooded my mind. Thinking about developing prostate cancer and becoming gravely ill or potentially dying made me nervous about what that would mean for my family. The doctor proceeded to tell me that there are ways to decrease my risk of developing prostate cancer. He has given me a plan to follow to decrease this risk. After leaving the doctor's office, I realized I needed to start getting things in order in case something was to ever happen. This includes arranging life insurance, drawing up a will, etc. Although I do not believe anything will happen to me, this event has made me realize I need to do these things. Doing so will ease the burden my family would have to face should something bad happen. Its a sad realization one must come to when getting older, but it is something that must be done.",,3KAKFY4PGVOM6VBIQQ6E9TXTE093ID,0.0

He was stopping by to see how everything was going and if the business was thriving. After being assured, my father invited him into the house for a glass of gin. He kept looking at me standing off in the corner watching as they chatted with each other. He asked my father if he would like to make another transaction and my father said ""yes"". He went on to talk about what a pretty girl I am and how he would like to make me a concubine in his harem. I did not know what he meant. I am only 14 and have not seen much of the world. I have been protected by my family and not aware of the customs of our country.  After much negotiation back and forth concerning my worth, they reached an agreement. I was nothing more than a slab of meat in the window of the shop waiting to be purchased.  I was then commanded to pack my belongings for the trip to his home. Of course, my mother was upset but she told me to be brave.  She said I would learn to love him in time but I had my doubts.

It will be a day that I will remember for the rest of my life. My mother was calling me early in the morning. That's a rare thing because she knows I'm more than likely sleeping. Then she tried to get a hold of my girlfriend. That's when I knew it was something serious. I called and she told me that my father wasn't doing well and that I should see if I could make arrangements to go and see him. I then received a text, yes a text, from my brother saying that my father is with my sister now. My sister had passed away as well. I was confused. First my mom says he's not doing well, the next thing I know my dad is dead. I called my mom and said that my brother told me daddy was dead. She freaked out and hung up the phone. From what my brother told me, my dad had been dead but the respirator was still on him and that's what made my mom think he was still alive. I was devastated. I hadn't seen my dad in almost 7 plus years and now I would never get to again. I had so much to say to him and still so much more to learn. I still can't believe and catch myself talking as if he's alive. My mother isn't taking well but I think and hope she'll survive. I'm still mourning and probably will for the rest of my life. I don't ever want to celebrate my birthday again.",3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2LD2UY,3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGC2LD2UY,0.0

I spent the rest of the work day away from other people so I wouldn't get angry at them. After work I returned home to find that I needed some food. I thought that I could hop over to the nearby grocery store for some dinner. I drove over to the grocery store and found a parking spot in-between two other cars. I noticed the person to the left of me was also getting out of their car. We made involuntary eye contact, but we lingered longer than normal. That's when it hit both of us that we knew each other. We slowly both realized we were friends in high school who hadn't spoken in years. We started chatting on our way into the grocery store and soon found ourselves laughing at old memories. After each getting our different items at the store we left together. As we were in the process of getting into our cars we exchanged phone numbers. We promised to get in contact and have dinner or something. By the time that I was on my way home I was in a much better mood than before.",,3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGCRRW2UI,0.0

I was somewhat annoyed in that I didn't really have time for this and this errand would put me behind. I walked out to the car and started loading the groceries into my little Civic. That's when this black car drove up behind me and rolled down its window. The guy inside said ""Hey (my name), is that you?"" I was a little suspicious as I was surprised a seemingly stranger knew my name. Yet there was something, I couldn't place what, familiar about his voice. I said ""Yes...do I know you?"" He said ""it's (name of friend) from high school, remember me?"" All of a sudden memories came back to me. This was one of the few people I hung out with in high school! Given I was bullied really bad, I didn't have many friends and kept to myself. This was one of the few people that was always nice to me, though we lost touch after high school. My jaw dropped when I saw him again and I said ""1-800-555-ElCheapo!"" El Cheapo was the name of a fictional company we came up with that was there to make students lives harder. We'd use it to lampoon rules we hated, teachers we didn't like, ect by writing all sorts of cartoons/editorials about it. My friend laughed saying he remembered that and how we used to get a laugh out of it. So I stood there in the rainy parking lot for what seemed like forever, going back over old times. Each of us told the other memories we'd forgotten. While it had been over 20 years since I last saw him, it felt like we just picked up where we left off. For a handful of minutes, we were back in high school again. We traded contact information and promised to keep in touch. I said I had to get going as I have perishable foods in the car so we said our good byes. In the end, my mood went from bad to good! If I hadn't done that errand for my mother, our paths never would've crossed! A bad day transformed into a good one it was!",3KGTPGBS6Y72U4AZG7HN9MGCRRW2UI,,0.0

We'd initially bonded over our mutual interest in dogs/preservation breeding, and had been friends online for quite some time (three years!)... But living states apart had made meeting prior not been possible. We spent a lot of time ""talking"" but I didn't even know how her voice sounded. I felt very nervous on the way up, worrying that we might not ""click"" quite the same face to face. I remember feeling quite panicky and almost turning around to go home. It was a long drive up, plenty of time to worry. Even pulling into the parking spot at the event center, my heart was racing! As soon as we found each other, though, there was a big hug, and all was well. My worries melted away and for the first time in hours, I was able to lax. Even her dogs seemed like old friends-just as she'd told me they'd be! It was like we picked up right where the last conversation ended, and the rest of the day was spent having great fun together. We watched the dogs race and shared the experience, laughing and telling stories and even reminiscing about some of the things we shared. I was a little surprised just how natural it all felt. We were already planning the next meetup by the time I left to head home. I was left feeling a lot more confident about getting out of the house and meeting people/engaging with my friends--we even made a couple of new ones while we were there!",3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1W9KOH,,0.0

I admire her for that but it can be challenging as she can be curt. Over time I have felt a shift and in this visit, I felt that shift very strongly. She was softer, kinder and more vulnerable. She looked frail, thin. She was more patient and loving and was accepting of my recent unorthodox career choices. I felt myself opening up to her more and feeling at ease in saying what I wanted to. I saw that she received it as it was, without judgment. When we said goodbye to her early in the morning, she looked at both my husband and I very pointedly. I felt that this moment was significant. I felt that we all understood that her life hung in the balance. We all knew that we did not know or have any control, beyond the limits of modern medicine. I felt that I understood something about mortality through her, that we all are hanging in the balance and vulnerable at any given moment to death.

Reflecting back, I feel I've changed for the better. A year ago, I was discovering my brother's cancer diagnosis and doing soul searching. I treated him so horribly when he was sick, I was a real asshole. He deserved to have a supportive sister, not someone telling him he's making it all up and using his sickness as an excuse. I was so hard on him for so long, I wasn't sure he'd even forgive me... I wouldn't. We worked on our relationship and I supported him like I should have. It came up that he needed a bone marrow match. I immediately sent off my swabs, but it took almost 2 months to hear back. We were a match. We underwent the process and the doctor says I helped saved my brothers life. He has a real fighting chance now. We sobbed together. Reflecting on this year, I really got my act together. And as bad as it may sound, my brother's illness was instrumental to me going down the right path... and I'll be thankful to him for the rest of my life.",,3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAHAPLOKS,0.0

I began feeling contractions during the afternoon but they were sporadic. Once it was time to go to bed, I laid down but couldn't sleep. I tried to rest for three hours or so but finally gave up around 10:30pm. I got up and began intentionally laboring in a candlelit bedroom. It was peaceful but contractions were difficult and I was worried that I would not be able to completed my labor and delivery without pain medication. When my husband woke up around midnight and asked if I wanted company, I said yes, and felt relief that at least he would be there. He began helping me through contractions using accupressure, which helped immensely - so much so that I had renewed hope for a natural labor. We left for the hospital around 2:00am and got checked in by 3:30am. I was so so thankful that I had progressed so far on my own by the time I was admitted. At that point, I felt sure that I could do this. We got to the hospital room and I got into a warm tub. I labored there for only a few minutes before I felt that she was going to come soon. I got out and began pushing while in a bed. It's such a relief to be able to push when your body tells you to push. She came at 4:45am and I was so proud of myself, and in disbelief that I had done it! A natural birth!",,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4CFHWVJG,0.0

I decided to take a few weeks off from work and just reconnect with myself and nature. A friend had suggested I go to Alaska, it was far away and desolate, it sounded perfect. After much research I wound up agreeing to go dog mushing around the interior of Alaska with a native of the area. I was nervous for sure, but it sounded like the chance of a lifetime. I needed to break from reality badly. I had been working 7 days a week for months and felt like my brain was about to explode. After a few days of riding around the lonely outskirts of Alaska I really started to feel better. I stopped thinking about work. My mind totally cleared and for the first time in forever I really felt at peace. The scenery in Alaska is amazing. It is hard to explain. It is so plain and vacant, but is is beautiful. It looks untouched, like no one has been around to destroy it like the rest of the world. My favorite moment of the entire trip was when we took a short break to let the dogs rest. I was sitting in the snow and I looked over and saw 2 moose walking across the ice. I had never seen a moose up close, it was breathtaking. They are bigger than a car.",,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4CGEVVJA,0.0

It was a big decision in my life and the hardest one I ever had to make. I lived in a small European country, Montenegro, for 30 years of my life. I was happy in Montenegro but I started feeling that I am unable to advance too much in my professional life. My main focus was to get hired for a big company where I can learn more about web design and building websites for the clients because I have a Bachelor degree in this field. So, I finally decided to move and live in the USA where my husband used to live for the last 10 years. My husband was so excited that he will not have to fly 2-3 times a year to Montenegro just to spend time with me. When I come to Michigan it was very cold and snowy. Nothing like beautiful Mediterranean weather I am used to. I felt some uncomfortableness around my heart and thought that I might never get used on this coldness. I took my laptop and checked which company are hiring web designers. So, in the next 2-3 days, I built my resume and I applied for 3 companies I found most attractive. One of them was MPH Marketing Solutions company and one week after the application they called me for the interview. I was so excited. My interview went very well and they hired me. They showed me the office and introduced me to other workers. It was a small size company, very clean and organized. Workers with different racial and cultural background were very welcoming and I felt positive about my start. On the other hand, I missed my family and friends a lot. I talked with them every day using Viber, Skype, FB messenger but it was not enough. I would dream of my hometown and when I would wake up I felt sad and lonely. I missed my father who was suffering from Alzheimer and I was afraid he will not recognize me when I go back visit. I tried to be busy all day just not to think. So, two days ago I booked an airplane ticket for me and my husband and this spring we will visit my hometown, Podgorica. I am full of expectations and looking forward to seeing my friend and family.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI138SRFKS,0.0

I was apprehensive about what the future held but I knew that this needed to happen in order for me to grow. It took me a while to go through my belongs and sort out what I had room to take with me and what I needed to part with. This was an emotional process in and of itself. I had lived in one place so long I had acquired many sentimental items and memories. To go through them all and decide what I had room to take with me was somewhat painful. Once I was through this process I packed up my moving van and headed out. The journey took about 12 hours and I finally in my new home. It was exciting to see new places, try new restaurants, meet new people. I feel that this process helped me learn more about myself and see things from a different perspective. I have learned from the diverse set of people in this metropolitan area and what their backgrounds are. I am now enrolled in a masters program and have a new job. Things are done differently here and cultural values are different than where I come from but I feel happy. I miss my family here but I plan to visit often and I hope they come to visit me as well.

We swam in a river, barbecued, went fishing. It was a fun and bonding weekend with my kids and their grandfather. My dad is a little absent minded. He had forgot the key to the gate one night at the cabin. He had to get a lantern and go up in the dark into the campground to get the key. While my daughters and I waited in the dark outside the gate. I told my kids ghost stories while he was gone. We got a good thrill! We also had a flat tire during the trip. Had to spend some time dealing with that. My dad put a screw into the tire to plug up the hole temporarily. So we could drive into town. This was good that he was able to fix it that way, because I did not have a spare, just a fix a flat inflator. And the area was so isolated, we had no signal to call for help.  A couple of my cousins came up no Sunday afternoon and went swimming with us. I had not seen them in years, so it was fun to spend time with them. We drank beers and got a little tipsy and told my girls some funny stories from when we were kids. The coolest thing that happened, was we were catching fish and putting them on a rope to leave in the water. We left those fish there for a while as we ate dinner at the cabin. By the time we went back to get our fish, a huge water snake had come and swallowed one of the fish whole. The snake killed itself. It was very long, about 3-4 feet. We got a lot of cool pictures and a lot of attention from all the other fisherman in the area. Overall, it was a fun and adventurous weekend that my kids will never forget.",,3KOPY89HM9OI16VO88RELUCTG7C3JC,0.0

He had been planning this event for years. He is a perfectionist and usually needs everything to be perfect and just the way he had planned it to be. He does not handle change well. Growing up with him, I remember how he often used to get stressed when we changed plans on him. I knew that his wedding was a big deal for him. He had planned to have a beautiful summer wedding on the river in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The venue he chose was positioned in a perfect location overlooking both the river and the city. He had specifically picked a date in May as he knew that the average temperature during this time was 80 degrees.  However, this precision planning seemed to have backfired on him. That morning I looked outside the window and saw what looked like the coldest and rainiest day in the history of May. There were about fifty people who attended, most wearing summer attire. Families began arriving at the venue and most were still hopeful about having the venue changed.  There were several messages sent out in the family group chat that read, ""What is going to happen with the venue, will it be changed?"" and, ""it is way too cold and wet today, surely this will have to be moved to an indoor venue at least?"".When I arrived at the wedding, I began seconding guessing my cousins decision not to have the venue moved. By then the wind started picking up and it was not a pleasant day at all. The venue as positioned outside next to a river and by then all of the chairs and tables were drenched. Many of the guests began asking about the possible cancellation/relocation of the ceremony. However, my cousin was determined to give his bride the view that she had asked for. To many of the guests amazement, they decided to go ahead and move on with plan A. When we all finally mustered up the courage to go outside, the most unexpected thing happened, the wind had stopped, the clouds opened up, and a ray of warm sun shine shined directly onto the alter, almost as if it were planned. Although the wedding was not exactly perfect,  it was beautiful site and the happy couple were able to enjoy their special day n a ray of sunshine. Everyone was able to breather a sigh of relief at the end. The wedding turned out to be just fine.",,3KOPY89HM9OI16VO88RELUCTJAGJ35,0.0

There was little shopping and not much employment opportunity. It was very exciting to come to a new state. It is a warmer climate than what I was used to so. I hope I get used to the heat. Most people that have lived here a while seem to do ok in the heat. I thought it was funny that I needed to use different and new make up and hair products here. The things I used to use just don't work so well here. It has been very energizing for me to be somewhere new. I enjoy going out in the evenings and visiting new places.

And for the past several months, I've been getting beat, over and over again. Tennis is one of my specialties but I was doing so poorly that I decided to sit the French Open out, which is one of the bigger tournaments of the year. So I was mostly a spectator at a time when I would ordinarily be throwing thousands around. So I'm watching the matches at the odd hours of the day, as the tournament is in France. I was able to enjoy most of the matches without ever getting the itch that I wanted to bet on it. One guy in particular though, named Wawarinka, brought the urge back. He's an older Swedish guy who used to have the potential to win any match when he was playing his best. His best was far behind him though, as he had been suffering through all kinds of injuries the last few years. And early on in the year, I had lost betting on him a couple times in big moments. Wawarinka was playing a new, young Greek guy who was already ranked top 10, Tsitsipas. I was watching this match with great interest and I fully expected Tsitsipas to win. The match ended up going very long and after being tied two sets to two sets, they started the fifth set. I was really surprised that Wawarinka had survived this song but I was so confident that his tired legs wouldn't allow him to cross the finish line. So with just a few seconds of thought, I put a 3k bet on Tsitsipas to win 2.5 something thousand. Almost immediately, Tsitispas had three chances to break Wawarink's serve. And even if he didn't end up winning the match after breaking serve, he would be such a huge favorite that I could cash out with a nice profit. Three chances he had......And he missed all of them. After that, I felt my stomach turning a little bit. Even after playing 4 or 5 hours of tennis, Wawarinka was still playing strong and now he had momentum. I couldn't take watching anymore and I decided to go for a run. I came back and saw that Wawarinka broke Tsistipas and won the match. I lost 3k in about twenty minutes and I haven't bet on a match since then.",,3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMFKXSMX,0.0

It's on me to have clarified what exactly that meant. And I didn't. The night of, I had planned to put everyone in Ubers to get them to the restaurant. It's worked before and was no problem. I get the first round of people in Ubers and start to call for another, when one of the agent representatives that accompanied two of our guests said, ""We should just take the hotel shuttle. It's free."" Now, I knew that I shouldn't have agreed. My gut told me that it was easier and more direct to take an Uber and there were hotel guests being dropped off at a concert across town and that would impact us. But I agreed. Like an idiot. The ride took almost an hour, when, had we taken an Uber, it would have been 10 minutes. Half of the guests were waiting at the restaurant for us. People were hungry, I was cranky and panicking. This was going badly. Service at the restaurant, once we arrived, was not great. Food came out in weird waves, drinks were left unfilled. It was not a great look. Worse, still, was the presentation of the check. To me. She had taken about $50 off a $350 bill. The celebrities kicked in money, which was not the plan, and I picked up the rest. It was awkward and weird and unpleasant in a way that made the rest of the night just 'off.' I didn't go back there for months.",3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMMNFMSM,,0.0

Usually, the company I work with carry out performance appraisals every year and based on the results, the company could decide to confirm your appointment, or offer you a promotion. A few weeks after I clocked one year, I was summoned by HR for my appraisal and I began to get really nervous. I was to appear before a panel the next Monday to answer some questions and review my performance over the last 12 months. I was dressed up and ready to go. Just as I was walking to the conference room, A colleague mistakenly spilled his coffee on my shirt. I was devastated as I was specifically advised to appear as smart and neat as possible before the panel. I had no time to go home to change so I had to walk in that way. I was so tensed up. The first question I was asked was why I looked so tacky. I explained that few minutes ago, a colleague spilled his coffee on my shirt and there was no time to go and change my shirt. The members of the panel laughed and told me the session was not going to take more than 3 minutes. They said they had noticed my work ethic and just had to summon me for formality sake. They made positive remarks about my performance and told me to check my mail box for a break down of my scores. They then handed me a letter of confirmation which also contained information about an upward review of my salary as a confirmed member of staff. That was it. I came out as the happiest tacky looking fellow in the world.",,3KV0LJBBH370LGMBMV52JK7QY4UMRW,0.0

It has been a long sad process although this fate has been in the cards for quite some time now.  She was an alcoholic for most of her adult life and things had gotten quite bad over the past several years.  She disappeared and was out of touch for the past five years or so, we'd only hear where she was if she ended up in rehab, jail or the hospital. Last March I get a phone call that she is in the ICU and has only a short amount of time to live. I try to get back to see her but am unable to for a couple months.  This lead to a trip home in May and I wasn't even sure if I would get to see her. She happened to be back in the hospital the day after I landed and I was able to go in for a visit. This would be the last time I'd ever get to see my sister. She was so different and sick and completely ruined. She had been an brilliant young woman, beautiful  and could have had anything but she fell victim to a lack of family support and the harms of drugs and alcohol. I admit that I have had my own struggles throughout my life and often have thought about my sister while trying to straighten myself out, even long before she passed away.  She passed away one month ago to the day and it has been life-changing in many many ways, I'm trying to be better everyday so that I can find a way to honor her and not let her death be in vain.  I want to be able to help others that find themselves lonely and lost, like she often was. There is much that I need to learn and a lot of growth that I need, the loss is still fresh and I often find myself confused about how I'm feeling lately.

My youngest son was off to his first day of kindergarten.  I was excited for the new adventure he was about to start but also sad that my baby was off to kindergarten.  I had to force myself to hold back the tears.  I didn't want him to be sad.  I wanted him to look forward and be excited for this day.  We had read the book ""The Kissing Hand"" the night before to remind him that I love him and will be with him.  He was a little scared about the day.  I remember holding his hand and walking him up to the doors and down the hall to his classroom.  You could see all of the other parents doing the same thing.  I gave him a big hug and walked him into the classroom.  I was at a loss for words and was surprised when he turned to me and reassured me it would be ok.  His teacher showed him where his desk was as I waved goodbye to him.  I could feel my eyes start to tear up as I turned to leave.  I made it out to my car before I let go of the tears.  I went home and waited.  I couldn't wait to hear about his day.  Thankfully it was an early day.  I waited outside of the school anxiously looking for my son.  I finally saw him and waved to him.  I was happy to hear that he had a great day and met some new friends.  He said it was scary but also fun.  I was so relieved that he had a good first day.  It was so hard to see my baby growing up but it made it easier to know he was ok.",3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0BL42C,,0.0

It seems like the kids are adjusting to their new school! They have been making lots of friends. They like their teachers too! Starting work has been a bit stressful for me though. It is hard to adjust to the new office, and all the new co-workers. I hope I can make some new friends soon. Even through all the stress of moving to a new place, I know it was a good decision. San Francisco is a gorgeous city. I love to take trips to the beach and watch the seals play together. I can't wait till more good things happen! Talk to you soon!

The d.j. was late so we didn't get music while I walked down the isle. I forgot my wedding band and had to improvise. The food was amazing. I got way drunker then I should have.

However, we did not just move we bought our first house. We didn't move very far from the townhome that we were renting but the process of buying a house and moving when you have kids is all very challenging for sure. I am 47 years old and I catch myself thinking that I will be able to do these things the way I could before but then I realize that before all this I wasn't married, had no kids and was younger and had more energy! It's been about 3 months now and the worst of it is over and I feel relaxed and pretty settled in. There's always some fun things to for example, I thought it was fun to have my first Ring doorbell set up, and of course not having to deal with landlords anymore and their just greed and total lack of understanding that we needed things like heat and a working stove. Right now sitting at home and working I think if I was still living in that place and trying to get through this day there would be this huge cloud of stress over me from that situation. I also have a better layout now though where I don't have to go up and down stairs all the time like you have to do in a townhome. And we're a single family home! No more shared walls! There's so many good things now and I'm so happy and thankful that we were able to do this. One of the best things to come out of this was pretty surprising - instead of just leaving wall mounts the previous owners left behind 2 smart tvs! They actually also left behind a pool table but during the property negotiations we were pretty sure that they would be leaving that. They may not have expected to leave or give so many things but I think that they had so many property transactions going on and so much of their own moving stress that they just had to do whatever to be done with it all and move with kids and dogs and all the things that must have made their own move very difficult. I think they were actually a week or two between closings as well the way that their timing worked out and they had to store everything and just live in a hotel for awhile. It's much easier to go from renting to buying a house then to go from one property that you own to another I think. I'm glad things worked out the way they did for us and I think everything worked out for the sellers as well. They were definitely a blessing to us.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII34724L,0.0

By the time Fisher got in her yellow Volkswagen, the sky had transformed again: It was somehow both shrouded and glowing. Many other residents had learned to keep a “go bag” packed by the door, with water, medications and copies of important documents; a woman from the local Fire Safe Council, a volunteer known affectionately as the Bag Lady, held frequent workshops demonstrating how to pack one. But Fisher was indecisive and moving inefficiently. It had taken her nearly 40 minutes to commit to leaving, wrangle the dogs and scramble to grab a few haphazard possessions. It was now 8:45. So many calls were being placed to 911 that a dispatcher interrupted one man reporting a fire alongside Skyway Road — the busiest street in Paradise and the town’s primary evacuation route — with a terse, “Yeah, sir, we have fire everywhere.” Officials had started issuing evacuation orders about an hour earlier; Fisher’s neighborhood was among those told to clear out first. Her street was plugged with cars. A thick line of them crept forward at the end of her driveway. There are five routes out of Paradise. The three major ones spread south like the legs of a tripod, passing through the heart of town and continuing downhill toward Chico and the valley below. Fisher lived in the northern part of town, on the easternmost leg of the tripod, Pentz Road; she rented a bedroom from a woman who worked at a nursing home in town. It baffled her to see that all the cars in front of her house were heading north on Pentz, cramming themselves away from the center of Paradise, away from the valley, and further uphill. The opposite lane, meanwhile, was totally empty. It seemed obvious to Fisher that, if the fire was approaching from somewhere in the canyon behind her house, there would be plenty of Paradise left in which to safely wait it out.

It was an amazing party. I told them what I had done over the last few years. I told them how much I wanted to see them again. They told me that everyone was in on the surprise.

I work in customer service and I am on the phones 8 hours a day 5 days a week. I was slowing loosing my voice and then boom, I woke up and my phone was gone. I couldn't talk and when attempting to do so, it was very painful. This was the week before memorial weekend. I reached out to my boss via email and explained the situation to her, she had already been aware that my voice was in bad shape.   I had to call out. I called out but didn't go to the doctor that day. I figured I would drink some tea, and would be fine, well I had hoped I would be fine. I woke up the next day, which was my day off and it had gotten worse. my glands were severely swollen. I didn't have health insurance so I had no choice but to go to the hospital, which I incurred a $800 bill due to that visit. Now I forgot to mention that fact, that now my glands are swollen I freaked out, because my dad had passed away from throat cancer and prior to that so did his father. I was scared to death sitting in the waiting area, waiting to be called. After sitting in the waiting room literally for 4 hours I was then seen by urgent care. He looked in my throat never even checked my glands and told me it's possible it was a virus. He gave me a shot of Steroids in which he stated will help the swelling to go down, and he made me an appointment with an ENT specialist. The appointment was 2 weeks away. My voice got a little better, but there was no way I was able to talk on the phones for 8 hours especially since I had 3 upsells per phone call. I used up my personal days. I reached out to my boss and informed her that I was going to have to resign, my appointment was two weeks away, I was freaking out thinking it might be cancer. The doctor only gave me a note for 3 days. if I was out one more day. She put a recommendation in for me to be rehired. I went to my ENT doctor and he said I had a virus and he took a better look at my glands and said my glands being swollen was due to me having blockage in one of my saliva glands and not drinking enough water caused it to flair up and lose my voice.",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFR8PDDOT,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFR8PDDOT,0.0

My family lives about 2 hours from Boston but we decided to take a bus to the city in order to celebrate. So my dad, mom, sister, and I got to the bus station early in the morning and began the trip. When we pulled into the bus station in Boston, it turned out that we had a lot of extended family members waiting for us who also made the trip. It was awesome to be able to see these family members because I hadn't seen them in so long. I saw all of my cousins and it was like no time had passed between the last time I had seen them. Last time we were all together, was at a family reunion when we were little. That was such a fun time and me and my cousins always enjoyed it so much. So being able to be with them all again for my aunt and uncle's anniversary was wonderful. We spent the week exploring the city and seeing everything that Boston had to offer. We went to the harbor, ate at a lot of restaurants, went on the duck boats, and just enjoyed being with family. This was the most fun I had had in a long time. Finally, the week came to an end and we all had to say goodbye to each other. We promised that not as much time would pass until the next time that we saw each other again. I feel like we grew closer as family members and will remember the trip for the rest of our lives. I love my family.",,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRE3NODC,0.0

I live about 5 and a half hours from my parents where I grew up and we don't have very much disposable income. Due to this, I often do not get to visit and my kids miss out on some quality time with their grandparents. My parents are very proud grandparents and very active when they are with my kids. I got a small bonus this summer and used it to go visit my parents so the kids could have some time to spend with them. We had a lot of fun throughout the whole time including spending time at the local lake for my mom's 70th birthday. This resulted in my kids playing some mini golf, fishing, and paddle boating all day long in the hot summer sun. We had water balloon fights and went out for ice cream and visited the specialty vintage toy and horror shop. My kids loved all of this and I loved all of this. There were so many other things that sparked a lot of joy during this visit. However, there was one thing we did on two different nights that brought me the most overwhelming positive emotion. My mom grabbed an old mayo jar in the evening one evening and my parents, my wife, me, and all 4 of my kids ran around at dusk in their big yard on the edge of the forest and caught fireflies until we couldn't see anything anymore (no street lights out there). Over the course of this, there were so many laughs and amazingly funny screams from the smallest kids when bugs landed on them. We saw bats flying around in the last sliver of daylight as well which sparked even more excitement. I felt like a kid again and loved being outside with everyone. It helped me hold onto my youth a little bit longer and made me appreciate my family and my parents even more.",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRHMWODQ,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRHMWODQ,0.0

I was both happy and sad at them gaining independence and getting one step closer to leaving the nest. Also, seeing my youngest go through that day reminded me of my oldest child's first day of school 12 years earlier. There was such a rush of emotions as I kissed them both and wished them a good first day. Knowing it was my last with my oldest made me cherish and remember it that much more. My youngest, even though he has been at home with me for his whole life, was not at all afraid of bring at school without me which made me proud that he has the self confidence to know that he can do it alone.  We walked together to his classroom and he gave the teacher a big hug when we got there. I helped him find his seat and put his supplies up. He wanted to do most of it on his own to prove to me he was ""big kid."" I was hesitant to leave him but he told me he was fine and I could go. Watching him sit at his desk and making new friends was made me so happy. He seemed very confident in himself which made me feel I had done a good job at parenting him so far.

He was comforting me in a way because he knows that I feel sad that he is already getting older, and sooner or later, will move out. When I dropped both of them off, I went to a coffee shop to do some work. It was a sunny day, everything feels like a perfect day, but at the moment I was done ordering at the coffee shop, I went to the rest room, rushed actually to wipe a little bit of tears because I felt sad still. It was a weird feeling but it was a day that I will always remember the rest of my life. Later that day, I asked my children where they want to eat or what do they want for dinner. We went to Applebee's and we all ate a lot because for me, I was very stressed for the day, but very thankful.",,3L0KT67Y8F2CGCB2KNTI3PZTT6MYSX,0.0

For a bit of background, I live in a basement apartment in a house. Half of the time, the upstairs is an AirBNB, the other half it is rented by other tenants. The upstairs has two bedrooms, while down here is just one. Anyway, the previous neighbors were a couple, they were pretty nice, they have a dog. My new neighbor is a younger guy, who also has a dog. When he moved in my landlords let me know he was moving in. I decided to bake him some cookies, so I biked down to the grocery store to get chocolate chips. He started moving in, and I made the cookies. I overheard my landlord mentioning that she was thinking about baking cookies but did not because it was too hot out, so I was relieved that I wouldn't be doing something redundant. I finished the cookies and was nervous about bringing them up. Was the timing good, would he be busy? I am nervous about talking to people. Eventually I put them on a plate, covered the plate with plastic wrap, and brought them up before they lost too much heat. My neighbor was out there, near his car, I talked to him and handed him the cookies which he accepted. His mother was helping him move in, I shook her hand and talked to her also. Once the conversation seemed like it was winding down I said I'd let him get back to moving in and went back inside. Also I gave him a card with my phone number.",,3L0KT67Y8F2CGCB2KNTI3PZTUAASYO,0.0

My sadness had overtaken my nervousness and I had tried my best to remain composed while reading. When I saw the look on my grandmas and dad's face, I instantly started crying. In this moment I knew that I was never going to see my grandpa again. It is as if it hit me all at once right there in front of everyone-- he's really gone. Who is going to read my kids their Christmas books on Christmas eve? Who is going to joke about how much food we made for Easter? A thousand thoughts had come to my mind all at once and I felt overwhelmed. I am still trying to get passed the fact that he is gone forever. I am not sure how I will ever accept that but I am trying hard everyday. It's been such a sadness I couldn't describe, I wasn't ready to see him like that at his funeral. I can't get the image out of my mind, I just want to remember his smiling happy face instead of what I saw at his funeral-- cold and just not ""grandpa"". As much as I had tried to make the tribute into something beautiful and happy, I don't think it mattered because we all knew he was gone. I enjoyed the fact that the service was non traditional-- he had an exceptional personality that definitely was not traditional. Overall, I am extremely sad about him being gone but am trying my hardest to move past the sadness I feel everyday.",,3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJABQINU6,0.0

I stood there shocked thinking well dont you think you should want forgiveness from me too. But of course I got nothing not even a sorry . So no she will not be able to see my kids.  Just so they should be come attached and  maybe become victims of the same abuse I did. That would make me a responsible. Because I Know what she is capable of. Even if others are fooled by her sweetness. She always talkes about chursh and loving god but where was that love when i was little. Surely god saw what you did to me .

The ceremony was held outside in a lovely garden which opened up to a large field with a hugh white podium decorated so elegantly with white flowers.  The other members of the wedding party did not wear formal wear as did the groom and bride which was a nice contrast.  They instead wore ballerina wear.  The backdrop of the white chairs on the green grass was also very lovely.  It was a very sunny day so the brightly colored umbrellas that were handed out as we entered the garden as a nice touch.  The reason the event was so memorable to me was because it brought together a lot of my other cousins whom I had not seen in many years.   I have very happy to have the opportunity to see one cousin in particular that I had not seen since we were little girls.  I could not believe how much she resembled herself as a girl so there was no problems identifying her at all.  We exchanged cell phone numbers and promised to stay in touch, something I plan to do as we are both getting older every day.  The other main reason my cousin's wedding stood out for me was seeing my elderly aunt, (bride's mother) who is well into her 80's now, attend the event and enjoy the day.  She has had a few health scares and it was really good that she could attend and be a part of the festivities.  I also think it did everyone good to sit outside in the sun while breathing in air freshened by all the foliage that surrounded us.  My cousin usually goes for either very flashy men or men who depend on woman more than they should, however, this time around, she chose someone who stands on his own and who enjoys a simple life being with the one he loves.  We all can see the love they have for each other which made the day that much more enjoyable knowing that finally, she has chosen well as she moves into the middle stage of her life.",3L6L49WXW1JVC3Z7JKS3UPLUF90549,3L6L49WXW1JVC3Z7JKS3UPLUF90549,0.0

Last year my grandfather passed away so it was even more meaningful for all of to be there for her. I also looked at my own life and decided to change my relationships with my parents which have been stressed and difficult my entire life. My parents have been very controlling and my grandmother was always a close connection to me. I was always able to rely on her. She was my greatest connection and stablized me. I always have been her favorite I think. Its funny because I never apprecaited that until I had kids. Its so important to bond with people. I just want to help with her and make things better. I think this also will increase my time with her in the future. I am going to change my plans going forward. I want to help her.,3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMR3GADW,,0.0

I went to college at NYU and loved the neighborhood it was in, the East Village. Due to financial reasons I moved to Brooklyn after graduation, since that was what I could afford with my job. However, I didn't like how inconvenient that place was, so I started my own consulting business on the side. With the revenue I made from my consulting business, I was able to make a lot of extra money each month. This meant I could comfortably move back to the East Village. I moved back into an amazing apartment and my mental health has already improved. When I go home, I no longer need to spend 35 minutes on the subway. When I go home, I am uplifted walking through my familiar neighborhood. When I go home, I am in a good mood, as opposed to a tired mood. I think the rest of my year will be positively affected in a significant way because I've come back ""home,"" in a sense. Studies show that the most unhappy time of your day is your commute, so anything that cuts down on that is awesome. My friends also love my apartment and come over a lot. They didn't like travelling to Brooklyn. I understand why they didn't want to do that.",3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNUU0O9XJ,3LBXNTKX0SH5BSPT6L7P3GNUU0O9XJ,0.0

It was a shock to all of us because her death was so sudden.  She had stomach cancer but didn't know. One day she didn't feel well and asked her neighbor to take her to the hospital and three later she was gone. There wasn't anything the doctor could do, since the illness was so advanced. My cousins didn't tell the family how bad her condition really was so  I never got a chance to see her before she died. When I heard she was in the hospital I assumed she would get better and I would see her when she got out. She lives in Europe and I live in the US so I wasn't able to visit her. I was planning on seeing her this Summer. I learned a valuable lesson from this. Life is short and you need to live it to the fullest. You never know when it's going to end. One day you're fine and everything is going well and then all of a sudden everything come crashing down. I will never see my aunt again and I'm going to miss her.

We had argued a million times in the past but always worked through them. we traveled the world together , and never really had many arguments we couldn't get past. I don't know what happened. I just got angry and said , well or thought. the hell with this I'm leaving.. I should have just got away until we both had calmed down. now I am always along and its sad. I only think of her, I cant eat , I cant sleep . I'm just beside myself with anguish. She wont answer my phone call, or letters, and I try every day to get in touch but her ex answers her phone and tell me to get lost.. hes not good for her, and she knows it, we have even discussed it a hundred times. So now I'm gonna have to find a way to get her back....also I am taking to her family for help. They want me to get her back and they also pass messages to her from me.

We go mountain biking every week. I was having a good time when my bike went out from under me and I slammed down onto my collar bone, breaking it and also some ribs. I was overcome with pain at the time, and just lay there helpless and really afraid of what damage I'd just done to my body. When the shock of the fall wore off and I became aware of my surroundings, I saw my circle of friends around me, busily assessing the situation and arranging for help, calling 911, asking if I was OK, etc. The ambulance ride was a blur, and I was taken to the hospital 30 minutes away. Later my family and some friends all came to the hospital, surrounding my with smiles and concern, and trying to make me smile and laugh. I was in so much physical pain when the fall happened, and whenever the pain meds would wear off at the hospital. But the support of everyone, my friends and family, was so great it just felt like my heart was full of good feelings and love for these people. I really felt so supported and cared for. It was weird to be the center of all that attention. I felt surprised at all the concern being shown for me. I guess in retrospect it's silly to be surprised by that. Of course I would have done the same for any of them. Yet still I was so touched that they all cared about me and showed so much concern.",3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA01358GQZ9C,,0.0

But what I was suffering from was almost ... an ANTI-eating illness. My body didn't WANT me to eat food. And that is truly weird. I should do some Internet research and find out what was going on with my system.	And I still find it .... interesting, that after taking the medication I was given to make me eat, I now eat regularly with no problem. (I just wish I had better food to eat!)I wonder if my current weird eating habits now have anything to do with my previous problem? I love toast with scads of margarine spread on it. And I'm suddenly really like strawberry. Strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, strawberry whatever. :)But just so long as I am EATING, it is much, **much** better for me, health wise, than what I was going through a few months ago.

I'm a disabled OIF/New Dawn army vets with major depression, anxiety disorder, PTSD, and minor agoraphobia, and my time has run out at the shelter, meaning the VA wouldn't pay for more than 2 years of staying there. I had been living in LA for the last 7 years, since I left fort hood Texas. I moved to LA to try and go to UCLA, but I didn't realize at the time just how bad my mental condition was, and it quickly became apparent. After about 4 years of on and off trying to go to classes, and my symptoms becoming more apparent and dictating my life's choices. For 3 weeks I stayed in a park, hiding as best I could, and coming to near starvation. I found out from another homeless vet that although there weren't any shelters or food cupboards I could go to without a referral near by to where I was, I could always travel the 25 miles to go to the VA where they would place me in housing of some kind. So I finally did, and they put me in a recovery program for the homeless, mentally ill, and drug addicted vets of LA.  It turned out I was much worse outside and it was apparent to others how much worse I was doing mentally, than I was aware of on the inside - and the VA very quickly approved not only the increase to my disability benefits, going from 50% service connected to 100%, and also paying for my shelter stay on a 3 month basis, with a second manager from the VA coming to check on progress and whether I needed the continued shelter. Of course, this was great news, but I was still new to medication and therapy, and I was in an extremely self destructive and self hating place. I wanted to kill myself, I thought about it daily, I didn't think there was any hope, so when the good news came in, it barely registered in my mind. Just like my physical shape – going from 220 pounds at 15% body fat to 400 pounds in under 3 years – I was nearly unaware of my circumstances changing. And the VA paid me 15000 dollars in back pay from when I submitted the increase in benefits. Looking back, I wish I has been ready to leave then. But I wasn't. And over that year, I ate nearly 30000 in fast food, almost never leaving my room, and eventually breaking my leg with how overweight I got. In May of this year my time ran out. I had been on medication for nearly 6 months, and it had started helping a ton. No more panic attacks when I didn't go outside. Very little suicidal thoughts on a day to day. And my new case manager had helped me come up with great coping mechanisms for when I left. And so I did. I left for Florida, where my son is, and I've been living here since. I've dropped 40 pounds, I go on walks daily, I'm eating less than 1500 calories a day, and swimming multiple times a week, and now even working online with amazon mturk. I have my own apartment, I shop by myself, I cook on my own, don't eat any fast food, and soon, I hope to be in my sons life.",,3LEIZ60CDKLUGNP873VA0135J0WZ9X,0.0

The floor was hectic and people were talking so loud. I had to leave and take a breather in the bathroom. I was worried about the way that everyone would see me afterwards.

It is even worse that the town is prone to flooding due to poor drainage. Well, it was 2 months ago when I was proven right. There was a fierce storm that was lasting for days and days. It was raining so hard I thought it would never end. The streets were flooded and people were now stuck in their homes, unable to leave at all. Emergency services were going about the town as best as they could, helping people they came across. It was starting to get dark, and the floor waters had started to rise above the windows in our house. I tried calling 911 a few times, but there was little they could do. We were simply one of many calling for help at the same time. I was alone in the house with my mom that night and not even she could seem to keep calm. We had no choice but to wait out the night and hope for the best. We made sure all of the windows were shut tight and we secluded ourselves on the second floor of the house to try to stay above the water. We waited out the night, not sleeping at all. We were mostly too scared to go to sleep. This was probably the scariest night of my entire life. Luckily, we both made it out okay.",,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFS8ZHDB1,0.0

It was a long time coming since they had both been together for what seemed like forever, so we were all expecting the proposal to be soonish. What I was more excited about was the bachelor party. My buddy and I get along extremely well. Almost too well. We both have a hugely diverse friend group who love to party, so I knew this was going to be nuts. What made this bachelor party nice was the fact the wedding still wasnt for another few months. He wanted it to be in the summer rather than winter since there were more things that we could do. So for this party, we all flew out to Denver. We both got some of our close friends out there and he had never been, so he thought it would be awesome to go out there and rage Milwaukee style, in Denver. We all flew out on a Thursday since the whole party/get together was from a Friday until Sunday. He wanted to stay until Monday, but if I knew myself and our group, there was no way we would want to stay an extra day in the condition we anticipated being in. So I flew out with another friend of mine Thursday evening and arrived at roughly 10pm. Far too late to actually do anything besides have a few brewskis and meet new friends. And that is exactly what we had done. Friday and Saturday both ended up being a complete blur. Between being kicked out of bars to losing people for hours, it was probably some of the most fun I have ever had. Between the groom and myself, we have some of the nicest guy friends in existence and it proved right this time around. I got to meet some of his friends that I had never met before despite always hanging out with the groom on the weekends at home. The best part about the trip was feeling like I left with more friends than I got there with, despite forgetting most of the experiences we shared together.",3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSZXEBDJ,,0.0

I had been looking for something to help put my daughter thru her last year of art school. I had worked for the company before as a home agent and manged all right with the stress of the job because I was also at home and could walk away for a few minutes when I needed to.  This time I was hired for in office work doing social media monitoring. I was ok the first day of training and was handling the stress of a new job ok. I spent 5 hours in training and walked out feeling a little anxiety but not terrible. The second day was a lot different for me. I think this is due to the focus of training moving away from the basic customer service information to client based expectations and company information. I spent 5 hours getting more and more anxious. Everything about the building, the people and what the trainer was discussing felt like it was grating on my nerves. I have had panic/anxiety attacks before and felt that one was coming. I walked out to my car, got in and started wheezing and crying and feeling trapped. I managed to calm down enough to drive a short distance home and then proceeded to have a long attack for almost an hour. It left me feeling discouraged, frustrated and incapable. I have worked several different jobs before and never had this sort of reaction before.",,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSJJQDBP,0.0

It was just as wild and eye opening as I was expecting with the opportunity to meet tons of new people to share life with. I was so surprised at everything we did. The groom's brother, was the best man and he planned everything. We started the night out with a nice poker game. We played for about an 2 hours. Great game of friends and the groom ended up winning the most which is great since he is the groom. After we finished our game we went to a loyal strip club for some fun and dinner. The show was great lots of beautiful women. The owner who was a friend of Jack's even had the lady's do a special show just for us to celebrate groom's last day of being a bachelor. Great music and great dancing I will never forget. When we were done we went back to groom's brother, and sleep for a couple hours. We had a 7am fight to go see the Cowboys play. I am not a fan, but Alex loves them and this was his day or should I say days.  We showed up at the station a couple hours early. We were all a little confused why and then to our surprise the manager of the Cowboys comes out and leads us to the field. Another friend there works for the owner in one of his other businesses and got us in to meet the whole team.  These was the best bachelor party I have ever been too. And I am glad groom had the time of his life. We flew back to town the next day and groom was married a day later. I wish him all the luck and happiest in his marriage.",,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSZXEBDJ,0.0

I believe that she took advantage of the situation by telling them stuff that was going on that wasn't going on. He was pretty much in a daze because of all the different medicine. And naturally she was the power of attorney and so whatever she told the doctors they were going to listen. He didn't even have a chance to defend himself. Now he's in some fucking mental ward.

It is easy to trust those around us, such as family and close friends.  Recently, my grandfather had a stroke.  He lost some of his motor skills and memory.  It may have changed him, but he was still a precious man.  He and my grandmother have been married over fifty years, and it would seem that there would be love and empathy, but there was none from her.  She had zero admiration, only hate for her husband.  She has claimed that there have been some significant events surrounding my grandfather, such as him urinating in the closet, running away, and chasing her throughout the house beating her.  My grandmother voiced her hatred for my grandfather stating that he had cashed a life insurance policy out during the 1980's for $5000, and she would never forgive him for that.  She simply could not let go of that, and her two daughters followed suit with their hatred toward my grandfather.  He had given all of them everything he could financially and from his heart.  His efforts were in vain because of the lies my grandmother told, she was able to commit my grandfather to a psychiatric ward.  It is a mental institution for the criminally insane, and he is a veteran.  He is unable to stand up for himself, and my family made him property of the state.  My grandmother also made arrangements that when he dies, the local university can have his body for science.  She has dared the family to have a funeral or memorial service.  A week ago, my mother called and said that she heard from my grandmother that my grandfather clinically died, but was revived.  He is all alone in a strange place, and he is very sick.  I am devastated.  The whole situation has made me consider how someone can make up lies about you, and there can be legal ramifications.  The very people that you firmly believe love you are the very people that are distrustful.  It has also opened my eyes to how important an advanced directive and a will are in order to protect people if they are ever incapacitated from evil people in their lives.  It is certainly impossible to know who to truly trust.",,3LJ7UR74RIZZ2S5DNKOPO6LGEZ34NJ,0.0

I was very surprised that they asked me to do the honor as I didn't know them very well.  I accepted, of course.  The ceremony was held about two months after his birth.  It's about 9 months ago now.  The rite is beautiful (Orthodox Christian).  It's an immersive baptism, three dunks.  Everything went well.  Except that he peed in the font while being baptized.  Embarrassing, but not unheard of.  There were two babies after him to be baptized, unfortunately, in the same water.  It's been great having a godson.  My wife and I have been unable to have children so it really has been a godsend for us.  We've also grown quite close to his parents.

She was on summer break and managed to drive here to stay at my apartment. Without a doubt it was amazing to spend so much time with her again. She lives in a different state while she finishes her schooling, so we don't really get to spend much time together. It's tough sometimes. We have been dating for six years so the long distance aspect hasn't affected our relationship, but we really needed this time to just sit back and enjoy each other's company. You can only get so much of a connection from video chatting with someone for so long. Eventually you want to reach out and give that person a hug. So this was a pretty wonderful time for us. Luckily I was prepared and had nearly a month's long schedule of plans. Over that month we went to concerts, sporting events, and fancy restaurants. We also hung out with tons of old friends and went to numerous graduation parties. I even scheduled a big surprise going away party for her on the second to last day she was in town. I know she was thrilled and completely surprised by all the people I managed to fit in my tiny apartment. All in all we had a blast for that month, and I can't wait until she graduates and we can live together full time.",,3LKC68YZ3BPTTFO9Y5ULYN4CMD7WOW,0.0

We don't have many opportunities to spend lots of time together so this meant a great deal to me. We didn't actually do much of particular interest. He stayed in my apartment with me and my sister. We just enjoyed our time together. We talked about everything under the sun. Watched shows together we had put off so we could do it together. I taught him a new card game. We played other various video games together. Cooked together. He helped dye my hair. I introduced him to my mother and stepfather for the very first time as well.

My supervisor tested positive for cocaine! I would never have guessed that she used drugs of any kind. I'm really shocked and I feel so disappointed. On top of that, nothing happened to her because of it. Management did nothing. Nothing! Drugs are such a non-starter at work for all of us and it's not tolerated at all and for good reason. Everyone is so angry with management and trying to figure out what is going on and why nothing has happened about this. I mean, it's been 2 whole weeks and it's like it never happened. My supervisor is continuing in all of her supervisory roles right now. She's completely acting like a failed drug test never happened. All of us at work are concerned now because it seems like the rules don't matter (at least to some people?!). I'm wondering if someone needs to go to management or leave some sort of anonymous ""suggestion box"" note for someone in management to figure out what's going on and what the rules are for the rest of us.

I have about four classes left which is super exciting and just recently I took my latest pre-practicum. It is essentially a face to face test where you test your counseling skills to see if you are competent in those areas.  I did well but it would a bit of a struggle at the beginning. The main reason for the struggle is that I had not done really any practice on my face to face counseling skills.  I did pass the test and it was a fun trip.  The convention of sorts was held in Phoenix Arizona and I drove there which took about four hours.  It was a fun trip as I went with my wife and we stayed in a hotel close to the area were I would be doing my studying and test.  I enjoyed everything about the event for the most part.  I am very excited to get my degree and begin a new adventure into counseling but I am not done yet.  I will have to complete 1000 hours of internship before I can officially be a licensed counselor.  This is a daunting task that I am not looking forward to because they require you to complete 20-30 hours a week.  Although in theory this doesn't seem like much but when you work a full time job 40 hours a week and have other responsibilities throughout the weeks its something that can really have a huge affect on my life.  I know its going to be hard because essentially I will be working 60-70 hours a week.  The other problems is how will I be able to fit those hours into my work schedule.  This is something that I have thought about and I am confident I can do it but it just seems like a lot of things could go wrong.  I will definitely have to be ready to take action and be able to get a decent amount of sleep throughout this time.  This is going to be very hard but I have a lot of faith in my ability to succeed.,,3LOZAJ85YEZUB84ULCSATTFG5TX2XI,0.0

I was shocked to find that she had things in her history that were so terrible that CPS felt the need to investigate and eventually remove the children from her care. This threw the family into chaos. Three months ago, things really changed. My son had to move in with my husband and I. My infant granddaughter also moved in. Now that she's here, I find myself raising her on my own. I love her dearly and want nothing but the best for her, but it is hard. This poor innocent child now has to suffer the consequences of her parents' actions. Why is it that the good among us always find suffering at the hands of those who choose to do badly?

I realize compared to the risk of riding in a car the chance of a crash happening is statistically lower, but not in my opinion. I do not think something that size has any business being in the air and basically propelled by fire. This is all beside the point because three months ago I had no choice but to get on a plane to attend my company's annual event. This year it was at the state's capitol. I'm glad it doesn't take place at the same location every year, so that's a positive aspect. I rarely visit the capitol so at least a bit of excitement was added to the mandatory plane trip. I would have preferred at least one night's stay in a decent hotel instead of having to fly back on the same day. That is way too much flying for me and maybe even most people. It felt like a waste of resources and there could have been a better, less wasteful alternative to the entire event. It's difficult to say whether or not I had a good time considering I spend the entire day being anxious about traveling on two different airplanes. If the annual event next year is two plane trips in one day, I may have to find a way out of it. I don't think I could handle another stressful travel day like this one. Speaking of stressful, my nerves were so shot from the traveling I decided once I landed I needed a stiff drink or several to take the edge off. Thankfully I arrived home safely and as soon as I got off the plane, I was calling my best friend. I didn't want to go out for a drink alone. Luckily she was considering going out for a few drinks anyway and hadn't found anyone to go with. We met up at our favorite local bar and had quite a few drinks. We eventually became exhausted and it was late anyway, so we shared a cab so we could safely get home. I'm glad she was able to join me. To my surprise the day turned around because my evening with her was so enjoyable.",,3LPW2N6LKUOUT1TMYQJL7TJODS3U5B,0.0

We just got back from a wonderful cruise vacation with our family so we didn't plan anything huge. We found an Italian restaurant nearby that we have never been to and wanted to try. We got dressed up nice and drove there just to find out that this place closes down for a summer break. After 20 years of marriage this is not a big deal. We got back in the car and my husband took me to a Japanese steakhouse. We didn't have a reservation but we got a table in just about 15 min. The food was great. I had ahi tuna steak and my husband had the seafood combo. Our chef was great and cracked some pretty funny jokes. He was amazing with the cutting skills and he did the usual onion volcano thing. We had a lot of fun and had a nice experience to bond over some good entertainment and good food. We had some fun table mates too that I didn't mind sharing the table with. At the end some stuff members came out with a huge drum and wished us happy anniversary along with some nice cupcakes. It was a happy outing that we will remember for a long time.,3LQ8PUHQFME103IH5BVGDNY3NSDHIK,,0.0

The past few weeks had been nothing but a blur; we'd had reading period and exams, and then I went home for two weeks to do basically nothing but visit family. Once I flew back to Boston, it was a few more days of hanging out with friends, making some final memories, and finally beginning that last day. At any rate, around 6 AM, I was down in the dining hall in my cap and gown having mimosas with my roommates (I'd later discover that giving a bunch of hungover college students mimosas and then keeping them away from a bathroom for half a day is a questionable idea). We didn't really talk much; I think we were just tired and overwhelmed. Eventually, we were all called to head outside and get ready to parade from the House to Harvard Yard. We were led by a small brass band that was only slightly better than the Harvard University Band, which isn't exactly a compliment. They directed us to Memorial Chapel, which they somehow packed in the entire class of 2019 into. Fire codes were definitely violated. At Memorial Chapel, the minister gave a short sermon and led the class in a few hymns. I'm not religious at all, but being in that church with that group of incredible people that were going to go on to do amazing things was a really powerful experience. I felt very connected to everyone. I also had to pee, but it was absolutely impossible to get out, haha. Afterwards, we went outside to Harvard Yard to begin the very long procession into Tercentenary Theater, where the commencement exercises are held. My roommates and I were near the front and got to wave and cheer the long line of alumni, faculty, and guests (including Angela Merkel!!!) as they entered. The actual exercises proceeded as they always have. After the sheriff of Middlesex county formally calls the meeting to order and the standard pleasantries are observed, the dean of each school presents his/her class to President Bacow, who would then essentially say ""Poof! You've graduated!"". Afterwards, I and the other Band seniors ran up to the Band as they played the recessional music and we each conducted our favorite fight song. As big and grand as the actual exercises were, they paled in comparison to the feeling of being with the Band, which was the one place at Harvard where I always felt absolutely welcome and included. Band absolutely defined the past four years of my life, and standing in front of them as I conducted Ten Thousand Men of Harvard -- I felt on top of the world. Afterwards, we had the actual degree ceremony back at our House, which my roommate and I were nearly late to. It was a really noticeable contrast from Band as I noticed that of the hundred or so other graduates in my House, I only knew my roommates and perhaps ten others. That night, the Band party provided both closure and countless tears. The next day, I was off to Greece with some friends for a vacation.",3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVR2AFZ2J,3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVR2AFZ2J,0.0

While I myself refrained from drinking too much, my aunt did not follow the same game plan. I looked over a one point and she was dancing with a glass of tequila in her hand. After a few hours of repeating this behavior, she got really sick and threw up all over the table. It was embarrassing, but in our family embarrassing is the norm. Overall, minus the vomit, everyone had a great time. It was such a treat to spend time with some family member and celebrate a new party of life beginning.",3LRKMWOKB63JG349MUGVQEVRUNEZ20,,0.0

I saw a UFO while walking my dog one evening four months ago. It looked like the traditional flying saucer you might be familiar with. The object was spherical in nature and changed colors seamlessly from purple to a deep, full green. I didn't know what it was at first, but ascertained that it wasn't like any flying object I had seen. I didn't think it was of this planet, honestly. It was hard to imagine it being terrestrial. My dog didn't see it, but then again I doubt my dog would care much anyway. I didn't want to share it a lot because people probably would make their own assumptions and not believe this story. But I know what I saw. It was nothing like I had ever seen. I don't remember much of a sound being attached to it. Of course, with these sightings, I wasn't able to grab a picture.

I had to work the day of the date which was fine I would be off work with plenty of time, and it would make it so I didn't overthink what I was doing and make me nervous. I decided to take a shower around an hour and a half before I left so my hair was fully dry and I wouldn't look weird. I brushed my hair after getting out of the shower and got the clothes I was wearing to the date on. I then decided to chill out until it was time to leave, since I didn't want to walk around thinking about what I should do. I wanted to act natural and like I planned everything in advance. It came time to leave and I headed out to the restaurant we were meeting at. I got there pretty much as she got there and we took our seats at the table. We both ordered and then talked while we were waiting for the food to come out. I thought we were at least somewhat making a connection, since we had some similar interests. I learned enough about her that I definitely would have gone on a second date with her if she wanted to. The conversation died down a bit when the food came out because we were both pretty hungry.  As we were both getting down eating I had to use the restroom, so I excused myself. The floors must've been wet in the bathrooms or by our table because as I was walking back I slipped and fell face first into our table. I landed right on the corner and busted my forehead open and started bleeding. As if that wasn't bad enough, I also spilled what was left of our dinners and drinks onto both of us. I started apologizing right away to the girl, but there is only so much apologizing while having a busted open forehead can do. I ended up going to the hospital and getting stitched up. She never responded to if she wanted another date and I don't really blame her for that.",3LS2AMNW5GCO9ISNMWVF6YMQYCQQOM,,0.0

Several months ago my brother passed away.  Since that time I have been searching my soul.  I have felt the need to get my life in order.  I had two or three unresolved issues in my life and I have felt the need to resolve those issues.  Resolving those issues has been a struggle for me, but while on this journey, I have felt and experienced God's amazing love and grace through it all.  I started by taking an intense Bible study that lasted ten weeks.  I have spent time in prayer, pouring my heart out to God.  I have learned that my past mistakes, hurts, and pain does not define who I am, but my life in Christ defines who I am.  While studying the Bible, I have found so many verses about God's unfailing love, His truths and promises, forgiveness, and strongholds that Satan has reminded me of for too many years.  I started writing these verses in a small notebook and when I am having a bad day, I can quickly find what I want. I have learned to forgive and let certain people know that I have forgiven them, and I have learned to ask for forgiveness for things I have done. I am on my way to freedom! Sometimes freedom it is not an instantaneous thing, but a work in progress.  To find it, I must study God's word and apply His truths to my life every day.  God's love and grace is so amazing.  I am glad he did not give up on me! Recently I have been able to share my story with a couple of good friends.  One of them gave me a small card the other day.  One side of the card said something about faith is like a tiny mustard seed that can move mountains.  The other side said ""I have been assigned this mountain to show others it can be done.""",,3LUY3GC630MWO0Z95XZOV7AL2NPP7Q,0.0

All there for the event that was about to take place, of which I would be on stage and having to face these strangers. It was nerve-wracking, but all my dedication had led me to this moment, this sensation of displaying my success in front of these thousands. It was Graduation Day, and nothing could have felt better than owning up to the last four years of my life, and seeing the fruit of that labor. The dean and president began their speeches, lovely poems and quotes about embracing the future making up the bulk. I couldn't see my family, however, I knew they would be looking for me once I am called to receive my diploma. The clapping that took place after the speeches could have triggered an earthquake, or maybe just my senses were heightened on this occasion. The air was crisp and cool, with the overcast sky darkening the ceremony it was very relaxing. I had done it, and now my life is truly ready to begin. What awaited, I did not know, and to be honest, I did not care. In that moment all that mattered was taking in the sights that are once in a lifetime. Only once would I be on this stage that was foretold about for years. Ever since I could remember, College was this distant place that would somehow change my life. However, now I can see that that is the truth; reflecting on the ways I have grown and matured, it really is surreal. All those years of sitting in a classroom validated in a single moment, it was overwhelming. This was a moment that I would reflect on forever, an eternity of waiting to lead up to the rest of my life. How could I not enjoy this?",,3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAI3QVKBD,0.0

Honestly, we ignored him because he tends to be dramatic and he seemed fine. Then one day he started feeling these sharp pains in his chest so he went to the hospital. We all expected he'd be home later, we didn't expect he would be in the hospital for 3 weeks. It turns out my dad had a heart attack a few days before going to the hospital. He has had heart attacks before, he had minor surgeries as a result, and he was fine. This time it wasn't that easy. He had some tests done the next day and it was discovered he had severe blockages in his heart. He needed 5 bypasses performed. To say my family was shocked would be an understatement. I remember I was driving my mom to the hospital to visit him and we still didn't know what was wrong. My dad called and said something about surgery. Emergency surgery, we didn't really understand what he was saying. When we finally got to his bedside it was explained to us how serious the situation was. He might not survive. He might survive but die soon after anyway, due to his age and smoking history. I remember this day so vividly because it was the day I really had to face the reality that my Dad might not live much longer. It was the day his ""Superman"" exterior really started to crack. He was scared. I'd never seen my dad scared. We were all scared, it was the beginning of a very long and emotional month for me and my family.",3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIJJ7BKI,3LYA37P8IR9IFL5J5M6W4SAIJJ7BKI,0.0

I was so nervous the day of surgery. I was fortunate to have a family member with me because you can't have the surgery without someone being there. Everyone at the surgical center was very nice and tries to put you at ease. I had an eye exam before the surgery to confirm the type of lens to be used. I was prepped for surgery with a mild anesthetic. It's a very strange feeling to be awake for the surgery. I was very much aware of what the surgeon was doing which was a big surprise to me. I could feel everything, but there wasn't pain with the actual surgery. I was surprised that I was able to talk to the surgeon and staff.

These are words that caused a fully functioning adult and changed her into a child. A child who has to depend on everyone around her to keep her clean, to keep her healthy , to help her relearn to walk . I had a good life, great job, great coworkers or so I thought. In July of 2018 i started having symptoms of many things, none of which I would ever imagined would be a mass on my ovaries. I knew something was wrong with me, I did not feel like myself but I continued to do my everyday activities, going to my job, working out on my treadmill, occasionally lifting weights with my home gym. I was eating healthy and losing weight everyday, which I had finally gotten under control. One day I was picking up my car from the garage down the street and on my way home I thought I had passed my house. I literally had no idea where I was, and that was pretty f'in scary. I went to my PCP and told her I was no longer comfortable to drive. I had been driving everyday since I was 17 years old. I was able to work at home thanks to my employer but the more I worked, the less focused I was. I initially thought it was due to my vision, so i had my eyes checked. They weren't terrible, but I thought I would give my glasses a try to see if it helped. It didn't. I went on FMLA, never thinking I would have to go through what I went through. After 41 days in the hospital, undergoing a multitude of tests, plasma exchanges, testing for Lyme disease, I went to the rehab inpatient for 7 weeks. I had 4 sets of serial casts, fitted for my braces which I continue to wear everyday thanks to my father. I am finally in outpatient therapy and I should be happy as I am making some progress but negativity around me drags me down. I love my mother and my brother and sister but it seems I am never doing enough for myself. They don't understand that if I could do it I would be. I have started standing at the parallel bars, my knees pay for it later,but they aren't hurting in that moment. I got up on all fours,never thought I would be so happy to be on my knees but I could do it.. and that is what matters. I am focused on getting my legs strong enough to stand. Hoping for some solutions when I have my doctors appointments this week.",,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34DG2SWB9,0.0

I'd been to Saco a few times with some friends and I have always been yearning for another trip. We’re all getting older, so it’s tougher to organize a trip with everyone, but I was committed to going. It was the last thing I wanted to do on my bucket list and I was presented with the perfect time to go about 3 months ago when I had quit my job after being offered a much better paying job in a new city. I took the leap and took the trip to the river on my own in this free time I had. I was nervous since I would be alone, but even if I didn’t make friends, I would be content floating on the river and relaxing in nature for 6 days. Much to my luck, when I got there, I almost instantly found a few people who were in the same situation I was and we bonded instantly. As we floated down the river, swapping stories and kicking back beers, our group grew larger and larger. It got to the point where we were floating in a big group of about a dozen people. We were from all walks of life and we would have never met or interacted in any other setting. Everyone had a unique life experience and we all enjoyed each other’s company and stories. We would stay up all night talking about our lives, what led us here, what we hope the future brings, and shared some of our fondest memories from growing up. This group of people were amazing, and I am so happy I was able to meet them. The weather on the trip was perfect so I was able to relax with my new friends without having to worry about the conditions too much. As it turns out, a few of the people I met were from the city I was moving to, so I made sure to get their contact info. I even met a really cute girl who I made plans with meeting up with once I got to the city and settled in. This trip truly was life changing.",,3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3MK6Z5K,0.0

I began doing dangerous and out of the ordinary things. The nature of manic attacks is that you lose all sense of right and wrong. Your inhibitions are non-existent. I began searching online for random sex partners. I'm particularly attracted to straight men, so that's what I searched for. I found someone who agreed to meet me and I gave him my address. He came over a couple times a day to be serviced, which surprised me. A week later, after the mania had subsided, he contacted me to stop by for another visit. He then asked me if I do cocaine. I said I don't and asked him why. He said he was being drug tested the next morning (which implies that he is either on parole or probation). Red flags went up and I asked him if he was an IV drug user. He said he wasn't but his girlfriend was a heroin IV drug user. I asked him when he had last been tested for HIV. He said it was a month earlier and it was negative. I had noticed through our conversations that he had some anger issues but I ignored them in my mania because the excitement was too overwhelming. After hearing the information, I told him I wasn't comfortable with the arrangement any longer. He became very angry and started harassing me daily, which lasted almost a month until I was forced to change my phone number. I am still concerned about his violent nature because he knows where I live. I have to take extra precautions when leaving the building, and I walk my dog five times a day. I would like to say that I learned my lesson, but I know another mania will strike me at some point, and I almost assuredly will engage in risky behavior again. It is the nature of the illness.",3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3O90Z5U,3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3O90Z5U,0.0

I'm still just so mad about what happened.  I guess I'm just having a hard time moving on.  If only there were a job that pays well and I wouldn't have to deal with people like Tiffany and Josh.  I just don't understand why some people get so much pleasure out of other people's pain.  It wasn't enough for them to call me names everyday and mess with my stuff, they actually wanted me to be fired.  Was I right to just quit?  If I had known it was going to be this hard to find a new job, I guess maybe I would have toughed it out.  You know what?  Now that I think about it, I probably should just walk back in there and let everybody know what was going on.  Rick did say I was the best worker there and he hated to see me go.  I bet he would hire me back.  Not sure why I let those two get the best of me in the first place.  Why should I give up a good job?  If they keep giving me problems, I'll give it right back to them.  I'll let you know how it goes...Dear Diary,Got it!  And in further news,  Tiffany was fired a few days after I left.  Josh is still there, but without Tiffany, he is not so bad. This is gong to work.   I am so happy that I went back.  Steak dinner tonight!",,3M1CVSFP61RZ7EYMCDQX532LAM2AQ6,0.0

She was a small baby herself when I birthed her, but this child of her's, this baby boy was just the cutest you'd ever seen. He was long, lanky and absolutly screaming when he arrived. There were four generations in the room that day. Great grandmom, Grandmom, me and my husband, her parents, her younger brother, husband and her step kids. So many people. But it was so worth the wait of this baby bundle. She was such a trooper, all the pain was taken in stride as we all took turns holding my daughters hand and helping her through it all. I just can't imagine everything that was going through her mind. I know when I was giving birth to her I was thinking about everything I'd teach this precious child. Maybe that was happening throughout the whole ordeal. I know she'll make the best mother ever, and this child will be the luckiest child to have such a loving mother.

The birth of my own children was monumental and shaped my life for the next almost 30 years. As my life went on, so did my comfort with who I was and how things were. After so many years, I knew that there was nothing that was going to change my views on life and me as a person. I was wrong. My daughter, Sarah, recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. This is our first grandchild. Let me tell you, there is nothing in this world that can prepare you for being a grandparent. It is an experience all to itself. The day started like any other, until I got the call. Sarah called to tell me that she was in labor and heading to the local hospital, and she wanted me there. I have never gotten dressed and out the door so fast in all my life. When I arrived at the hospital I found my baby, Sarah, smiling and excited to meet her son. On the way to the hospital I had images in my head of a girl who needed her mom to help her though this painful ordeal but there she was all smiles. As the day, and her labor, progress Sarah was her usual chatty, funny self. Momentary pauses during her contractions were but a semi-colon in her stories. It was hard to believe when the doctor said she was ready to push, Sarah had barely winced from what I know to be tremeandous pain. It seemed to happen in the blink of an eye. Sarah was calm and focused as she brought her son, my grandson, into this world. In that moment of birth I was not longer Mom, I became Grandma. Never did I think I could love any child more than my own, but I was wrong. Sarah was no longer my baby, she was a battle proven mother who I admired more than anyone. Though I was always careful not to spoil my own children, I found a yearning to give this little boy everything his heart desired. I had a new mission in life, to dote over and spoil my new grandson.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA48V36RC,0.0

I can just see his determination to do something without giving up, or you know, crying about it if ever he fails. This morning, I was doing my laundry while I was alone with my son. He just had his breakfast, which was Cheerios. His favorite was the sweet one, not the lame boring Cheerios you get that comes in a yellow box. After, he ate a full kids bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios, I then took my breakfast. I usually do that in order for me to focus on him first before I have my own breakfast. So right after our breakfast, I let him watch some Sesame street, while I do my laundry. Suddenly, after around 10-15 minutes of me getting busy with sorting out my laundry, I hear some little cute grunts while I was bending down sorting clothes. I kind of get to check my little nugget only by my peripheral vision and when I focused on him, he was trying to let go of the small table to get his balance sorted out! I rushed and got my phone for me to record his attempts to walk on his own, gave it my best support to my little guy. He fell a couple of times, and one instance, I guided him towards me, he looked so determined and very excited, he started his first steps, then walked four more steps, just on his own without holding on to anything, then I grabbed him and raised him up so high for him to know that I was very proud of him. I kept telling him that I was very happy and proud, it was a defining moment for me as a father. I realized and almost tore up thinking about if ever my Dad was still here, I would tell him everything about it, let him spend time with my kid. Being a father is definitely one of the greatest roles in life, my father made me realized that.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA4ALIR6U,0.0

For me, my biggest target was definitely Lyme disease. It sounded so hilarious, being named after a fruit! My whole tune changed that one July, however. I got pretty sick, and I thought it was mostly routine until it got worse and worse, and then wouldn't go away. I went to a doctor, and it turned out that I had, you guessed it, Lyme disease. Now admittedly, in spite of me making fun of the name I knew nothing about it. It turns out that I got the disease from an unfortunate tick bite. I didn't even know my house had ticks! I don't own any animals so it was even more surprising. Anyway, I know better now than to make fun of diseases. The symptoms have died down since then due to a combination of rest and medicine. Even so, I'll never make fun of a disease again, no matter how silly it may seem. I also managed to clean up my house and install anti tick measures. I'll never get this horrible disease again.",,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRQJQBQX,0.0

After arriving, we relaxed for a day in the hotel, simply sharing stories and enjoying the restaurants nearby.  However, the day I will remember for a long time came the next day.  Diane was not exaggerating. The day started off on a cruise through the Alaskan waters.   On the cruise was the most fantastic sushi which made me feel regret that it was contained only on the ship.   Afterwards, noticing the pool empty in this cold climate, we took a swim, with a delightful contrast of the cold of the air compared to the warmth of the heated pool.   With some more time to spare before arriving at the grand finale, we enjoyed a game of putt putt, to which I ended with a +35 score due to a mixture of incompetence and alcohol.     Finally, we reached the grand finale, a large shelf of ice which calved before our eyes.   On the way back, we were even treated to the unadvertised sight of passing whales. We flew back the next day.  We will not soon forget our trip to Alaska.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIE55RXNU,0.0

Make sure to practice ahead of time so that you can concentrate on your sister and not on your nerves.......There are two different ways to go with your speech. You can either be sentimental or funny..... To decide which is best, consider the bride and what she would likely prefer. It can depend on the tone of the wedding as well. Edit the templates using Adobe Reader. Fill your own information in with the details requested between the brackets to personalize the speech you select. A funny speech, like the one in the template to the right, is perfect if the bride has a great sense of humor and some cute quirks she wouldn't mind you sharing with everyone. For example, you could share a couple silly stories about how the bride likes cheese snacks dipped in dressing or that as a child, she tried to make toast in a VCR. The silliness continues as you share a couple impersonal dating tidbits and how you knew it was different with the groom. Pick this speech template if you know the bride wouldn't mind a few chuckles at her expense..........    This speech is written from the perspective of a sister who has a strong bond with the bride. The speech discusses their upbringing, recalls a childhood story or two, and talks about how growing up with this sister is entirely unique. The groom is casually mentioned and included as an integral part of the speech. His part in this speech is being welcomed to the family and the chaos you often go through.

A longtime friend of my wife was getting married to a French woman that he met in the US.  We had booked our flights and an AirBnB in advance and gotten a good deal on both. In return for a good price on our flights, they involved a couple of layovers. We thought everything would be great because we should have arrived in Paris the day before the wedding, with plenty of time to check into our AirBnB, relax for a bit, then go to the rehearsal dinner. We ran into problems on one of our layovers in Spain. We were in the Bilbao airport, eating at a Burger King, when we got notice that our flight to Paris was cancelled.  We hurried to the airline's customer service desk to see what was going on and to get a new flight. There was already a long line of angry people when we got to the service desk. We had to wait almost two hours before we had our turn and it was obvious that everyone wanted the situation to be over. The airline's customer service workers had no idea what was happening, why it was happening and they had no clear direction about how to fix the problem. They had been trying their best to reroute people to where they had to go and in our case, we had to take a 10 hour bus ride to the Barcelona airport. We crammed into the bus with about 50 other people. Once we arrived at the airport, the bus driver had no idea where to take us and generally had no idea about anything. We did about 10 laps around the perimeter of the airport, stalling and waiting for the bus driver to be told what to do. Eventually he just dropped us off at a terminal and immediately left once we were all unloaded. We went inside to find more airline employees who had no clue what was going on. They weren't expecting us, despite having 10 hours to be told that we were coming. There was another cancelled flight from another airport that they were dealing with and it look like they all wanted to slap someone and go home. We waited another 2 hours in line to get the earliest available flight to get us to Paris. The flight was at 6:30am, which by that point was just a couple hours away. We found an isolated spot in the airport to sleep and got about an hour of sleep before security woke us up and told us to move. We were able to get the flight we had scheduled this time and we got to Paris. We got to our AirBnB in time to shower, change and rush to the ceremony. We made it to the ceremony 20 minutes before it started and ended up having a blast, despite being sleep deprived zombies.",3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEWMONX6,,0.0

I think that to me, the event that was the most memorable was able to help a friend achieve one of his dreams. My friend has always wanted to be able to move out and live on his own since he graduated high school. I always love to help out friends whenever it is possible, but this situation was tougher than normal. I frequently would help him search for apartments for rent that were within his price range, but most of the time it was unsuccessful. Around 4 months ago, we had finally started seeing potential options. Once he finally found the potential one, we went and toured the complex. Everything had seemed to be going great, but we eventually found out that he would not be able to rent the apartment due to having no renters history. Now I already live in a different state than he does and I live on my own, so this gave me an idea. After giving it a lot of thought, I decided that I would offer to have him come live with me. At first, he had declined because he is not the type of person to accept handouts and he still would not technically be living on his own. I talked it over with him, and after a long conversation he accepted my offer. I've never seen him as happy as he was in that moment which really touched me. Since moving in with me, his quality of live and overall happiness have drastically improved. Even thinking back on that moment makes me emotional because i love seeing people extremely happy. Helping him out and having him move in with me has been one of the best decisions that either of us have made.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6NFOPKLO,0.0

Throughout the years we haven't had the best relationship at all. So during this time of being together we were able to get things back on track. to have a good father and daughther relationship. We spent a lot of time hanging out just to try and get comfortable with each other. That seemed to work out pretty well. being that eventuallly we started cracking jokes on each other. the most memorable part was when I told a joke that was true of something that he did in the past. No one seemed to be offended and that was great. We spent a lot of time out shopping and riding around in his car. I was able to get anything I wanted from the store we went to. We went out to dinner and ate seafood together. Overall it was a wonderful trip where we go to talk about the past. Times he wasn't always there for me and how he plans to not continue the same path. I really enjoyed hanging out and getting to know my father.,,3MD9PLUKKJ0F5PT28DEFI2YPD56NZY,0.0

I drove in tears to a local coffee shop, the warmth of coffee and the color of the pastries soothed me a little, I wanted somewhere quiet to draw. I was walking and looking at the menu, not looking where I was going and oomph! I ran into this big hulking mass of man. He was so tall with broad shoulders and a beautiful smirk as he said ""I'm sorry, I wasn't watching where I was going."" I lightly chuckled and said ""Ditto, like lemmings"". He laughed and we made small talk in line.  We paid for our things and sat down at our respective tables. I started sketching and he walked by with the pretense of throwing away a napkin and asked about my drawing. He then, asked if I wanted to go to this Italian place next door. I hadn't ate all day and honestly, I was all about the spaghetti from this place.  We sit down and start sharing things about ourselves and our food arrives.,  He asked, ""Do you want part of mine?"". He ordered the chicken marsala.  He smirked and said, ""because yours looks tempting."" In the act of picking up my plate to slide him some noodles, I drop the entire of spaghetti in his lap. I could've melted into the floor. and he just picked up a meatball and popped it into his mouth and looked me dead in the eye and said delicious. I laughed so hard, I almost cried . It melted all that sadness away, a few months later...I see that I finally have found the man of my dreams and am engaged!",3MD9PLUKKJ0F5PT28DEFI2YPESPNZS,,0.0

I couldn't concentrate and just broke down when anything could even be slightly related to a baby. Thankfully, she was kind enough to allow me the time off. She even had flowers sent to my home. My boss isn't the only one that has been kind. Mom and dad drove down to take care of the house. Dad's been fixing up some parts of the house that we were being renovated when we were still expecting a baby. Mom has been cooking meals for us and cleaning up the house. I am so thankful to have them here. Growing up, mom and dad always knew how to comfort me and make me smile. My friend Janine organized a lady's night out with the other girlfriends. We got manicures and pedicures. I had my hair done. Janine paid for everything for me. It's been nice to get pampered and to pretend like things are normal for once.

It’s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom’s side — granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it’s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around. It’s not that we’re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It’s that my cousin’s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai. Most of my mom’s family is still in Shanghai, and my cousin who is getting married lives with my aunt and my uncle and my grandmother in the same house that my mother grew up in as a child. My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak. Instead of focusing on re-learning the language in the year I had, I shoved it to the bottom of my mental to-do list. By the time December 2012 rolled around, I was no better at remembering how to say “Where is the bathroom?” than 12 months earlier. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, the reality of being in China’s largest city began to settle in. On the streets, taxis weaved in and out of lanes, miraculously avoiding crashes by near inches. People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn’t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese. My family had been assigned a big table together, and we could enjoy the w",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQAD31HUGT,0.0

Jessica and I have been dating for over six years now, with today being the seven year anniversary of the first time we met. She didn't know what was coming when I invited her to meet me after work at a restaurant a few blocks away from the park we met at. I made it seem like it was just going to be a fancy dinner. But, when she got there I acted like the place was full and we had to go somewhere else to eat. Jessica even got a little annoyed with me for not making a reservation. But I led her over to our park, the bench where we had met and my friend had the picnic basket there, just like I prepared. We sat on the bench and ate and drank champagne, watching the sun set. Finally, I got down on one knee and reminded Jessica that this was the same spot we'd met 7 years before. I asked her to marry me and my heart stopped when there was a second of silence. But then she yelled yes! It was so amazing and the best part is she wasn't expecting it. Then, to top it all off, I took her to my apartment where all our family and friends were waiting to celebrate with us. Jessica told everyone all night long how happy she was and how even though we'd talked about marriage, she didn't think I'd propose soon. Or remember the park bench.

She and her best friend were there when I arrived and had narrowed it down to 2 choices. She was both nervous and excited. The dresses were within her budget, which was great. It was especially great for me because I decided secretly to buy the dress for her. After looking at the 2 dresses, it was easy to see that one suited her much better than the other. She gathered up all the layers and went into the dressing room. When she came out she was beaming. She's petite, so it dragged on the floor, but otherwise, it was perfect. The bodice was modest, yet feminine. The dress was not too formal, not too casual, which was something we had worried about finding. The shop assistant helped to arrange the drape of the dress and to hold up the back to demonstrate what the bustle would look like on her. We all loved it. She also showed how the alterations would eliminate some wrinkling at the bodice that looked a little odd. We also looked at a few veils but my daughter decided she didn't want a veil. She saw some hair combs she thought she might like instead, but we didn't make a decision about that. They were rather expensive for just a fancy comb and we were concerned abut how well they would stay in her hair. We took pictures and they had my daughter ring a bell, which was some kind of bridal tradition I didn't know about, but was cute. She then met with the alterations person briefly and made an appointment for the measuring. While her friend distracted her, I went to the counter and paid for the dress. My daughter was surprised and happy to find the dress paid for. We all left happy and relieved that the big decision had been made and the dress was so perfect for her. I drove home alone, wondering how it would feel when I would drive home alone from the wedding to an empty nest. I was relieved-happy-sad-happy like a yoyo all the way home.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00GU5,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC00GU5,0.0

My mother was driving my friend, me, and my brothers back home because the wedding was over. My youngest brother, my friend, and I, were in the backseat and my eldest brother was in the passenger seat. Every one was tips and we all lost controls in so many things at the wedding before we left but my mum insisted we leave because she had to o to work early the next dayAll of a sudden, the world went black. I opened my eyes moments later only to see my mother crying helplessly and weakly for help. I looked to my left, where my friend was, she was calling for her mother, saying “I want my mom, where is my mom?” and complaining that her shoulder hurt. I then looked to my right, and saw my little brother crying, and breathing harshly. My eldest brother, surprisingly was fine. He asked me if I was alright, and I responded by saying, my head hurts. My brother suddenly looked at the side of my face, and said “Jade put your gloves on your face.”I saw strange faces telling us to be calm and was helping us out of the car, When we were fully out of the car, my mom was still trapped inside. Her door had been caved in and she was unable to move. I shed a tear, then quickly ran and looked for help so i could reach 911 and luckily I got and the quickly arrived. I watched as the ambulance rushed her away, began to cry, and then realized that my little brother was standing right next to me. He was not breathing well and his face was beat red. My little brother is an asthmatic, so I immediately alerted a medic. We all followed them to the  hospital where we were each assigned a room, my friend and I were in a room together, and my brothers were each in their own rooms. At thatat point  I realized that you don’t know how much you love someone, until they are fighting for their life just so they can live to see your face everyday. My mom is my idol. She has fought for her life in order to stay in mine and my siblings’. She has dumped guys she really liked, because she knows that when things are real bad, we are the ones that help her get through it the most. She has even gone days without eating so that we could eat. I look to my mom for everything, and am hoping she will be around for a long time. Death, can sweep you away in an instant. Some people just let it happen, but others are just too stubborn to give up.",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC0FGUK,0.0

It was a real scare for me and my family. At the time that it happened I didn't know how to react or feel about what was going on. I just couldn't get a grasp of it. being that my mom was badly sickend and she didn't have much time to live. we had asked the doctors if there was anything extra they could do. we wanted to pay top dollar for anything that could maybe save or even prolong her life. Unfortanetly there wasn't anything they could further do to try and help her. It was devastating to hear that. we just couldn't get over all the times we've spent together. everyone was very sad at the hospital. It was bad some of was going through it emotionally and physcially that made things even scarier. It made me think to my self about being strong and doing that benefits my life and body. I decided to be on the healthy side of things for the rest of my life. That situation really made me decide to change my life.,,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTLRIMV0,0.0

I am still in shock and awe at how this all happened and how quickly things went so so bad. This morning I was pondering on my life as it was several months ago. Work was my life and I was completely dominating in my field and felt like I was dominating in life as well. It's been a hard and long road since I first got sick and I'm worse now than when it all started. I remember the day I started to not feel right. I remember I kept pushing myself and wouldn't allow myself to slow down even though I could totally tell something was very very off. Being bedridden has been the absolute biggest shock of all of this. I could not have fathomed how horrible this would be. I can't even make myself food or use the bathroom without having someone to help me with every single step. I feel like such a burden. I was always on the move until one day I just wasn't. My family has been incredibly helpful although most days I feel so ashamed that I seem to not even be able to look them in the eyes. My doctors aren't carrying much hope. My age is preventing a lot of healing that might have come easier many years ago. I'm fearful that this is just now going to be my forever. I'm trying so hard to keep my mind busy, I hope my next entry will bring better news and more positivity.",,3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4A48P3MW,0.0

Two weeks ago, we started arguing about why I never want to be around her friends. I find them annoying, so I told her that. I think its pretty common for the boyfriend to not what to hang out with his girlfriend and her friends. She took it as a bit of an insult, though. She said insulting who she likes is an insult to her character. The whole thing was blown out of proportion. She tried to trap me with stupid questions like ""so if I get along with annoying people, you find me annoying?"" and things like that. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this was going to be a bad argument. I didn't realize just how bad until later in the night, though. We were supposed to go to dinner at my parent's house, but she said she wasn't coming. She loves my parents, and my mom's cooking, so that was a sign of just how mad she was. Still, though, it was such a stupid argument, so I didn't apologize. I went to dinner and then came back. She wasn't there. She decided to stay at her friend's house. I was shocked that she was so offended at this. We didn't talk for 2 days. We sort of made up after that, but its never really been the same.

For me it was memorable because alot of nice stuff happened. I was able to meet one of the voice actors that I adored growing up. I got to buy art and items of stuff that I enjoyed. Meeting people in lines was nice and getting to know them a bit. Spending time with family and just having fun together made it good for us. I also got to get some of my comics signed by some of my favorite creators. It was one of the happiest moments that I can remember because it was something that I cared about. It was something that I could do for myself and gave me the excitement that I had missed. Whenever I went up in line and walking into the convention center seeing cosplay and vendors it made me feel like I was at home. To be able to be around people who had the same interest as me. To be able to express myself without feeling weird or different. To know that I had family there with me that cared about me and what I wanted. Seeing the panels I wanted to see and be around a good environment. It was positive for me and pulled me out of a slump I was it. It gave me sense of belonging and made it worth the wait. It made me think that it was one of those small moments that I will remember forever. It made me feel one with myself and just getting to experience it was an adventure. It was an adventure that I felt I wanted to take again and again.,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXKSWLDV,3MRNMEIQW6SMEOLL4I93EIBXKSWLDV,0.0

His friends share a house and there was a room spare so he decided to move in. It was quite sad to help him pack, thinking that he wouldn't be living at home anymore.   That said, I was excited for him to start a new adventure in life. The most surprising part was helping him to go through his belongings to decide what to take with him. We found old books and toys from his childhood. We also found old homework assignments dating from 1st grade to 12th grade. It was a lot of fun reading them. Packing his belongings and furniture into a van took most of the day. My son was very excited but he also seemed a bit nervous. It was difficult to hug him goodbye but he promised to come back and visit very soon. He actually came back the next day! It turned out that he had forgotten quite a few things that he would need at the new house. He also found out that the washing machine didn't work so he would be coming home quite often! That made me happy even though it meant I would be doing his laundry again!",3MTMREQS4W44RBU8OMP3XSK7PPIWAQ,3MTMREQS4W44RBU8OMP3XSK7PPIWAQ,0.0

To our horror, a car rode past us so fast that we knew something way wrong straight away. The driver had a seizure, we were told later. The car ran into a fast food truck as we were watching. I can still hear that noise when i close my eyes. The car hit the truck real bad. When we got there, we saw the horror. The fast food vendor was lying there, in a giant pool of blood. he was gone.

He was involved in a fatal car crash.  And I remember every detail like it was yesterday.  It was 4 days before her first birthday - April 4, 2019. We were excitedly planning her birthday party, and hoping the nice weather would hold so we could rent a bounce house and host a bbq.   He had a tattoo that he wanted to have finished before the party so he could show it off to our friends and family.  It was a nice piece with her name on it and just needed some final touches.  He went with his sister because she wanted some work done too.  It was getting late, and no one was home.  I couldn't get either of them on the phone and I was getting worried.   I eventually fell asleep on the couch and was awakened by someone pounding on the door.  It scared the crap out of me because I had left the door unlocked, so I knew it wasn't Matt.  I opened the door at 4am to be greeted by 4 police officers to tell me that Matt had hit some black ice and slid across the highway and crashed into another vehicle head on.  He, his sister, and the other driver died instantly.  They felt it necessary to tell me that he must have been distracted because he had a handful of CDs in his hand.  I knew that the passenger was ALWAYS his DJ and he only did it himself when he was mad at the passenger.  He and his sister fought a lot - I have always blamed her for it.   It has taken us many much time, but we have slowly moved is on and made a nice life for ourselves.  My daughter is still dealing with it, but has shown great strength in dealing with it.  It took me a little longer to get past my sorrow and guilt (I should've went along and drove) but we are doing okay now.  I know he is watching over us.",3MTMREQS4W44RBU8OMP3XSK7RG8AWE,3MTMREQS4W44RBU8OMP3XSK7RG8AWE,0.0

I couldn't believe how beautiful both of them were on their wedding day. It was very influential, as one day I'd like to get married too, especially after seeing their wedding. Everyone dance, sang, and laughed during the wedding, as it was a very nice occasion. My friends asked me to give a speech at the wedding, which is something I'm not really good at doing. Although it made me a bit nervous I went ahead and gave a speech, as my friends requested. I talked about how great both of them are and how they've inspired me in so many ways just by getting married to each other. I let them know how much I cared about them and how perfect they are for each other. After the wedding was done we all went outside and talked for about an hour before everyone started getting ready to go to the reception. My mother was there and even she asked me ""when are you going to get married?"". I let her know that I would be getting married one day but I wouldn't be rushing it. I've always heard that rushing things never work out in the long run. This was a great day and I'm so proud of my friends and wish them the best in the future.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJ2BM4GH,0.0

We saw lots of animals and nature. It was so beautiful. There were lots of places to stop and take pictures. I think my husband started getting a little bored though. He started trying to entertain himself. My husband thought it would be funny to pretend to be Sasquatch and give me a scare! I however, did not think that was funny. We stopped hiking for awhile and had a picnic lunch. My husband brought all my favorite food which was really sweet. It made me forgive him for trying to scare me earlier. When we finished lunch, we packed up our things. Our our way back to the car we hear a noise behind us. I turned around, and started telling my husband not to try and scare me again. But it wasn't him. It was a bear. We stayed as still as possible and luckily to bear moved on to more interesting things. That was our anniversary adventure.",,3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJAUD4GI,0.0

It was the first time in my life that I had ever suffered any kind of major injury before. I was at home and walked from the living room into the kitchen to go and get a glass of water. I tripped on the tile floor and fell. I ended up hitting my head really badly. Apparently there was a decent amount of blood and I was knocked out cold for a few minutes. Luckily, my parents were home at the time and called 911. I was taken to the hospital via ambulance. When I came to my parents and other family members were there. Luckily, I ended up being fine outside of just being a bit out of out and being really lightheaded. I did not have any broken bones or a concussion or anything like that. I did have to stay in the hospital overnight, just to make sure that everything was okay. I ended up going home the next morning. It took me about two weeks to recover in terms of not feeling lightheaded and to take all the pills I was given for the pain. I also had some short terms memory issues for a bit but those subsided in that time frame also.

Basically you meet up for drinks and then get on a bus and go somewhere with this group of people. It was a warm evening and I decided to give it a go, and if I didnt feel like the bus I would stay behind on the bar patio. I got to the bar and ordered a pint of guiness and made some idle chit chat with people. I met up with an old friend and we decided to try this bus. We ended up at a local casino for an outdoor concert. The night was amazing, the food was great, and the booze was free. All in all I think I would do something like this again. As I said, it was at a casino so after the concert we got some vouchers for free play. I was a little tipsy so was looking for the perfect slot. I love the frog emoji on iphone so I wanted to find a frog slot. I found one called money frog and sat down. I downloaded my free play and started spinning. It was pretty uneventful until all of a sudden the screen flashed after a losing spin. It said Random jackpot awarded! I ended up winning $292 on a 40 cent bet. The next day I took the money over to my moms house to give it to her as a thank you for everything she has done for me. It was a great moment.

It was one of the craziest weekends of my life so far. It was a Saturday afternoon, and I went to an all day CHIRP radio station event at the House of Vans in Chicago, CHIRP stands for the Chicago Independent Radio Project, Nikki does some volunteering there. Anyway she was working a table and there were a few bands and DJs playing. I was off dancing and watching the music while she was handing out information for the radio station and selling some records. Apparently there was a drunk guy who kept sitting on the table she was working, right on top of the records Nikki tried to ask him to move but he wasn’t listening so she yelled at him, the guy turned around and slapped her in the face and ran off laughing. Nikki was absolutely beside herself so she came to find me and she pointed him out, I told her to go get security while I kept an eye on him and called the police. The guy tried to make a break for it when we approached him but we were able to block his exit long enough for the police to get ahold of him. We spent a long time filing a police report and winding down. Nikki didn’t want to be in Chicago anymore at that point, she needed a break and was shaken up, so we made the hour and a half drive north to Milwaukee. It was starting to get later into the evening and I asked if she wanted to just relax and watch TV. She said she wanted to be around people but someplace bright and not at a bar. We went to a nice bright sushi restaurant and had dinner but after that I wasn’t really sure where to take her, I usually hang out in dark places. On a whim I suggested we go to the Potawatomi casino thinking she wouldn’t go for it as neither of us are big gamblers, but surprisingly Nikki was up for it and we went. We gave ourselves a $20 limit each and lost all that money disturbingly fast, I suppose that’s how it usually goes. So we decided to get another $10 and just play the penny slot machines to kill time. We were chatting away and playing slots, getting the weirdness of the day behind us. I was getting down to my last few pennies and I wasn’t really paying attention to what I was doing when the slot machine started going nuts — I had won the jackpot! $79,502! Well half that after I split the jackpot with Nikki. We had some drinks at the bar and went home to crash and In the morning I took Nikki to the train station to catch the Hiawatha train back to Chicago and then met my Mom downtown for lunch at the Comet Cafe. I told her about my crazy day and in typical Mom fashion she told me that gambling is dangerous and I shouldn’t do it. Oh well, she didn’t complain when I paid for lunch though.",,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19M0VW4DW,0.0

I believed that just because you looked different from me and or liked different things than me didn't mean that we couldn't find a way to connect on a common ground. With all that being said, I remember even finding a way to communicate with kids who were in ESOL. I would talk to the ones who knew some English to kids who didn't know English at all. I felt as though just because there is a language barrier doesn't mean that you can't find a way to communicate with them. Forwarding to January of this year, I was working in retail and I just felt like I wasn't fulfilling my life purpose. I also felt like wanted to get more out of life especially when it comes to helping people. I decided to enroll into a course to get my TEFL certification because there are many kids and adults who really want to learn English and I wanted to be the one to help them accomplish that. When I started my course I realized how much harder it was especially since I was juggling work, coursework, papers I had to write, demonstrations I had to perform, as well as tests/assessments. I also realized how gratifying it would be when I did finish schooling. A month ago I found out that not only did I pass my final exam but I also passed my course with honors. As soon as I received my certification I immediately started applying to TEFL jobs. I heard back from about five jobs but decided to move forward with one of them. I don't know very many people who can honestly say that they love their job or their career and I am grateful enough to be able to say that I do. The decision I made to get my TEFL certification has been the absolute best decision of my life.",,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19M9PKD4Q,0.0

I had put on my work clothes and went downstairs to let my dog out to go to the bathroom. Upon walking downstairs, I smell this horrible smell. When I get to my dogs crate I see that she has vomited and has had diarrhea multiple spots throughout her cage. She is also covered in her own vomit and feces. I immediately get her out of her crate and wipe her down while I am trying to figure out how I am going to clean up the mess. As I go to wipe her down, she vomits all over me and the floor again. I put her in a kennel so that I can take care of the mess without her adding to the problem. I clean up her crate and throw everything in the washing machine to be cleaned. Meanwhile, she has thrown up about four more times and, by this point, I am extremely worried for my dog. I call out of work and rush my dog over to the vet hospital to be evaluated. My dog was given IV fluids because she was severely dehydrated from the vomiting and diarrhea. She was also given nausea medications, two different types of antibiotics and medications for her gut, as well as Immodium. In addition to all of this, she was placed on a prescription diet to evaluate if she was allergic to the food that i had been giving her for the past few months. Approximately $500, two days called out of work, and a new pair of scrubs later, I still do not know exactly what happened to my dog to make her so sick.",,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCID4M,0.0

Speaking of, our oldest child, Will, gave us quite the news this weekend! He is getting married to his long time girlfriend Stacy AND they are pregnant, due in March! AHHH! We couldn't believe it! I am so excited for him but at the same time I kinda wish they had waited on the baby until they had gotten married. Anyways, I want to be supportive and I really am elated for them.

My fifth (and final!) baby was born in June. I am divorced from my oldest son's father and waited a long time to remarry. So, there is a twelve year age gap between my oldest and the rest of my children. My children's ages are 20, 8, 5, 3, and 5 months. My oldest child got married in August, after meeting his wife at AIT in San Antonio. They were both training to be Combat Medics when they met. She is a Reserve and he is active duty. She lives in Oregon and his First Duty Station is in Washington, so they continued dating after they graduated AIT. They dated for a year and got married at a courthouse in Oregon. They decided to come home to Alabama to have a ""real wedding"". The outside ceremony was amazing, but HOT (August in Alabama is MISERABLE)! After the ceremony, my son gave me a present. It was a tee shirt that said ""Mom"". The word ""mom"" was crossed out and underneath that said, ""Grandma"". It took me a few seconds to process what my son was trying to tell me--when I figured it out, I started crying. I am so happy for my son but still in shock that I am going to be a grandma. I have always lied about my age and even jokingly introduced myself at my son's wedding as his aunt. I definitely don't feel old enough to have a grandchild. Since the announcement, I have gotten tons of ultrasound pictures, baby bump pics, and have found out the baby is a boy. There will be nine months age difference between my daughter and my grandson! Yikes! Even though I am beyond excited, I am sad that they live 3,000 miles away, which means I'll only see my grandson once or twice a year. It still doesn't feel real!",3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KCR7HMY,,0.0

I traveled there with my brother and a close friend and we spent the whole time relishing the change in scenery and culture. While staying there, I got in touch with a friend of mine on social media that had been my best friend throughout my entire youth. Through our back-and-forth chats, I discovered that she was visiting her sister in a small city rather near where we were staying. Immediately, we were both enthused about the possibility of reconnecting and didn't want to miss such a surprising opportunity. The vacation was nearing its end, but I decided to extend my stay there by five days since I didn't need to return to work for another week and I could spare the expenses. My brother and friend returned home on a flight the next day. The following day, we decided to meet at a local cafe. The cafe was a beautiful little countryside shop that was surrounded by some stunning scenery. I arrived first, but only had to wait for five minutes or so. We picked a table outside, which made for a very pleasant experience due to the lovely weather and tranquility. Somehow, despite having hardly spoken for eight years aside from a message or two, we reconnected so easily. Our conversation wasn't the least bit awkward or stilted even at the beginning and we fell back into a sort of easygoing, lighthearted rhythm remarkably naturally. After a small lunch, we spent the rest of the day traveling by train through the countryside. We talked and laughed and shared numerous stories about our lives over the years. Nothing felt difficult to talk about and the depth of our friendship seemed to have never left, as though it would be able to survive anything. We said goodbye to each other that night, but met up again two days afterward and spent the majority of my remaining time there together. Aside from the reformation of a wonderful friendship, the whole experience was one of the most transformative of my life. It reawakened my creativity and love of life to an extent that few other things ever had. It also emphasized the importance of maintaining my relationships throughout life. We parted in great spirits and have kept in contact regularly ever since.",,3N2BF7Y2VRGNWM88QQT85G5KN8WHMW,0.0

I was so mad that the next day I refused to accept his apology, which is unlike me. I normally am a very forgiving person. But I had had enough. I vented to my friends about it the next day.

She had lived a very active, long life.  We spent our free time going to the park and hiking along the shady paths along the lake.  For sixteen years, we had been inseparable, enjoying weekend excursions.  She loved to run along the quiet paths where we hiked.  She would bark at butterflies and chase falling leaves! I knew she loved the outdoors, so I helped her and carried her outside to lay on her favorite cushion on our sunny deck to take in the morning breeze.  She wagged her tail and laid her tired head on my kneee as I sat beside her.  She did not want to eat anything that I offered.  I had called before we went outside and had an appointment at her vet.  I carried her to the car and placed her on her favorite blanket.  I knew that she would not be coming home again, and I wanted this to be as easy on her as possible.  Although it made me sad to say goodbye, I knew it was time for her suffering to be over.  Although this was a sad morning for me, I am so thankful that we had our time together. Arwen, I will never forget you!  You made a huge impact on my life!",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26GYBKU1,0.0

I remember the day vividly, as I spent time with my boyfriend, friends, and family for my birthday, and my dad was there. We all went out to eat at one of my favorite restaurants, a typical tradition in our family. Boy, did dad eat a lot that day. He was so happy and was laughing the entire time. When we got home, I remember watching a movie and how he fell asleep on the couch, something he always did. I remember saying goodbye and giving the family a huge hug when I went to go see friends. It was interesting that he gave me an extra hug and told me how much he loved me. He usually never does that, I wonder if he knew he wouldn't be around much longer. The next day, he was in an accident and just like that, he was gone. I always knew he needed to take care of himself. Maybe I could have encouraged him more to eat better and workout more. Maybe I could have helped by cooking for him, or talking to him more. I hope he's resting now, and fishing and enjoying himself without pain or discomfort. I hope he's at peace.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26IGCKU4,0.0

This is an event that we have attended regularly for the last 5 years. We were joined by a close friend, who came in from out of state. This year was different, because we finally lived close enough to the event that we didn't have to camp the entire weekend; we could go home each night, shower, and sleep in an actual bed. This was great because it gave us a chance to start each day refreshed, as opposed to previous years, when the camping would leave us grimy and sore. I also could get a full night's sleep because we didn't have campers nearby keeping us up with their assorted activities. The acts announced this year were not nearly as exciting as previous years, save for a few big names. However, we were still excited at the prospect of finding new bands to enjoy. In the week leading up to the festival, the weather was mostly rain and storms, which started to worry me; even though we weren't camping, we would still be outdoors all day, and I didn't want to spend the weekend standing in rain and mud. However, the rain let up going into the weekend, and save for a few light showers one or two days, the weather was perfect the whole weekend. The music was great, as always, and it was nice to be able to spend a weekend with my girlfriend and our friends, without having to worry about work or other responsibilities. After everything was over, I was very tired and a little bit unhappy at the prospect of having to go back to work the following day, but overall, I was happy to have had a good weekend out. I don't get to take vacations too often, so small events like this are what I rely on to keep me refreshed and ready to take on the next challenge. I look forward to attending it or a similar event next year. In the meantime, I will look back fondly on the festivals I have attended previously, and will find smaller events to keep me excited until the next big one.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26HSMKU1,0.0

Now she is on dialysis and I am still wondering if I made the best choice for her, sometimes it seems like she is a money making machine for the dialysis center. Every time I take her to the center and I look around I doubt the doctor decision. The other day there were a social worker who works there said the same thing.

I have been diagnosed with end-stage renal disease and have been on dialysis for almost two years. When I look into my mirror, I don’t just see a failing pancreas and two kidneys that have been laid off. I don’t just see a very sickly person who might die. I see a woman and a mother whose life and personality have many different dimensions. A woman with a family that needs her more than ever. It wasn’t always that way. In the beginning, when I was going through hemodialysis and had more than 15 graft surgeries and 17 tunneled catheter procedures, I felt like my illness was stamped across my forehead and imprinted on my heart. End-stage renal disease and hemodialysis seemed to have taken over my whole life. I was a patient. I barely remembered who I was before the disease. Eventually, I’d finally had enough of being defined by my disease. I needed to take charge of my life. The first time I spoke up about what I wanted in regard to my treatment, my doctors were stunned. I took control and it was the best choice I had ever made--I think it may have saved my life. For the first time since I began dialysis, my doctors saw me as a whole person--a mother, an individual--and not just as a patient. Even more importantly, I was seeing myself as more than just my disease. Gaining my voice gave me back the parts of my life that I had missed. I was Cortney again, not just the lady with ESRD on dialysis.  My disease no longer consumed my whole life.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26SCUUKY,0.0

I decided to log into Facebook while I had my coffee. While scrolling through my feed I saw an update that my old work colleague had made. I worked with him at my previous job and considered him one of my closer friends that I left there. I had definitely fallen out of touch and had not seen or heard much from him. His post was about his weekend with his kids and how much his family meant to him. at the time I was leaving that job he had just welcomed his new baby girl and was very excited for this chapter of his life. I decided to shoot him a message to let him know it looks like things are going well. He responded quickly and told me everything is going very well but that's he was at the end of his rope with his job. He was interested to know how I was liking my new workplace so I told him I couldn't be happier with the move, I just wished I could have taken some of my team with me. Later that day when I was talking to my boss, the topic of new projects was brought up. It look like for the next year our calendar was full of new work. I said, ""Are these projects going to increase our headcount at all? This is quite a bit of work our small team."" She said we'd be looking to hire at most one to two more people for full-time positions. The timing of these events seemed serendipitous.

After all this time of not seeing him and barely even communicating with each other, he actually traveled all the way over here. It was so lovely to see my big brother and give him a hug. We joked and goofed off, just like we did when we were kids, and Paul would sneak into our bedroom, hide himself under the bed, then jump out yelling ""boo!"" so that my sister and I screamed with fright! I was not sure how well he felt, as he had recently recovered from a bout with cancer. He assured us he was fitter than ever, and so we did all the fun things families do when they live close to Disney World. We went to Epcot and Universal and rode many scary rides, ate lots of unhealthy food, and generally had a great time. Although, he kept insisting he was fine, I could tell Paul was getting tired quickly. But we continued on our exciting day, just glad to be in each other's company. When we were back at home, we would sit in the kitchen, each of us with a cup of tea, and reminisce about our childhood. The stories went well into the late hours, and we both were exhausted the next day from staying up too long the previous evening. Those days, I would not bother waking him till late morning, and I could tell he was grateful for the extra rest. I can't believe it's almost time for him to leave. What can I do to make his last few days with us the best ever? I think I will dig out some old board games we used to play and see if he remembers how to play them! He always could beat me though, I will have to try to outwit him! Paul went back home today, I really miss him.  We promised we would visit more often, I sure hope it works out.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26SESKUQ,0.0

She was due near the end of the month, and was still a couple of weeks from that point, but her contractions were getting more and more intense as the days went by. At the time, I was with her and her husband at my parent's house playing some board games, unaware of what was going to happen next. Suddenly, my sister starts reeling in pain and having difficulty catching her breath. The contraction went away but it didn't take long for the next one to come. My brother-in-law looked at me and asked if I could drive them to the hospital. I agreed. They grabbed their hospital bag and we went on our way. It was stressful the whole way since my sister was letting out mini-screams. We finally arrived at the hospital, and I asked my brother-in-law if I should just go home. We needed to figure out a vehicle situation, but for now he told me to just wait around. My sister was quickly rushed into the labor and delivery room and I was on the outside while I could hear her screaming. It took a few hours of labor, but she finally was able to get the baby out (it was a girl)! I went in when the baby was born and was able to hold her. I told her I was relieved all that was over, and offered to help any way I can. Everything was so unexpected since things went much differently than expected, but I was glad to be a support.

I don't think there will be legal trouble. Most everyone is understanding that it was accident. Hopefully everything keeps going smoothly and he gets his job back. My boyfriend said he was going to get a little side work with his dad at construction until he gets his job back though, and refuses the gig jobs. His dad hasn't had any work for him yet so I keep pushing the idea but he just won't do it. I asked what happened with the dog and he just burst into tears.

He's been really into those movies and toys lately and so we thought we would surprise him with seeing the movie. My wife and I don't ever really go to the movies together, nothing good has come out lately and it's been a long time since we were teenagers going every friday. Nowadays, you can actually reserve seats and order food; you can get there 30 seconds before the movie starts, have your seats and have your food delivered to you. It cost almost $75 for the three of us, but it was worth it for him to have a fun day out. He really enjoyed seeing the movie with us, and had a blast seeing all the characters. In addition to the movie, I decided to have a surprise for him. He's been saying he wanted a buzz lightyear for himself, so I ordered one off amazon and hid it in the car. When we got into the movie, my wife told him someone wanted to see the movie with him. His eyes really lit up when she took the buzz out. He held him and sat with him through the whole movie. I think I even, at one point, saw him talking to buzz, telling him something about the movie. It was really one of my favorite moments. We have a younger daughter who wouldn't do well at the movies yet, but it really makes me think about how much fun the two of them will be together.

He even talked to them once in a while about the movie as it was going on. We also had food brought to the seats, which he thought was awesome. My daughter enjoyed the popcorn, which blew my mind. My son is quite particular about food, but they had macaroni and cheese, which he loves. He really enjoyed sitting back in the electronic reclining chairs and watching the movie with us. At a few parts he got a little loud, but he's only three so we were not expecting too much from him, honestly. We went during a matinee so we were some of the only people in the theater.

I went back inside, felt tired enough to go back to bed, but I still had to change out of my wet clothes. Then I got a phone call from you know who. I got so excited that I didn’t care that I was naked, tired, and there was a puddle on the floor. We are going on a date this Friday. I don’t know how I’m going to sleep.

So I wrote the best note from the heart I could.  And I sent it, thinking nothing would come of it.  Well, guess what?  Today she wrote me back and said she loved my profile too and wanted to meet for dinner!  I am still in shock!  I've never gotten such a positive response from someone before!  And the thing is I like her so much too.  So now I'm waiting for her to call me.  She said she would when she got off work tonight and we'd meet.  I'm very nervous of course but excited too.

Since both of my parents passed away I got myself my own apartment, a new job, a new partner. Things have been hard to adjust but I have made things work. Financial struggles have been a norm for me. While I am able to have small things like a few video games, some DVDs and stuff I really don't get to have much fun with all I work. My birthday was this past August. To my surprise I had several packages delivered that day. All of them were gifts from various friends and family! One package was some brand new clothes. Another package had a really cool Figma statue of Link from the Legend of Zelda. A new cell phone was in a box, cheap, pre-paid, but exactly what I needed as my old one had seen better days. Another box had a couple new Switch games in it. However the big box is what surprised me the most...it was a brand new X Box and a new laptop for work! I had never had an X Box before and was really surprised someone would spend that much on me. My friends all chipped in together and got me  these things as a big cheer up/ birthday surprise. They all knew how hard I had been having it of late and really came through and made my day special. I felt so loved and so accepted by everyone and I don't know if I can ever repay them for their kindness. Getting the laptop makes doing mTurk so much better for me now s it is one of my income sources. I love my friends and I hope I can do nice things for them soon.",,3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZIC2TYOFK,0.0

I worked tirelessly for my family and tried to make sense of this task.  Mark, my partner at the firm was tasked with a different project section.

I had so many ideas floating in my head, but finally pin pointed the one that makes the most sense yet.  This company needs to grow and to do that we need an excellent strategy and proposal to get this client to trust us. When the day came to present to presentation everything fell into place.

To be honest I was scared to think that I was going to leave my bright and peppy twenties to enter the dreaded thirties and that my life was going to change drastically. Its like those scenarios you build up in your mind where you could imagine the worst possible thing happening to you and then it does. I didn't like that I would let myself think like that because intellectually I knew that turning one year more shouldn't really effect my overall out look on life but as with everything that involves a human being with emotions and sentiments; I found myself agonizing over the fact that I would be a thirty year old. The day finally came where my birthday was here and I had told all my loved ones to not make a big deal since it was a day I wanted to let pass quickly. But as always. my family is not one to take head on my requests especially when they know that down the line I would regret not making my thirtieth memorable. So they planned a surprise event for me and my close family members that live in another state flew to come to my birthday party. It was a memorable day that i will never forget because I saw my closed loved ones that I haven't seen in a couple of years come to see me on my birthday. More than the gifts I was given and the age that I was turning that I dreaded so much; I was able to make a memory that is going to last me a lifetime. I felt celebrated in the most perfect way and that was being surrounded by all the people that I love and cherish. One thing that surprised me the most  is that my family was able to keep it a secret from me for so long. They are usually bad at keeping secrets and the fact that they managed to do so was impressive. Plus the day got even better when I received a personalized gift that would be the physical memory of the day. It was a day that I will keep with me and tell to my children at one point. Fast forward a few months later, I have had time to assimilate that I am a thirty year old. to which now I can boldly say that I am proud to be the age that I am because all the life experience I have cannot be given to me but is only earned through tim.",3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICTZHOF6,3NC5L260MP8RIT2E8GKLUZICTZHOF6,0.0

When I took the lead on a presentation, I didn't realize it would change my career.  I've been used to taking charge in group tasks as I need control.  I like to know when things will be done and when.  Uncertainty eats at me, so it's just easier to lead.  As a result, the presentation was put together in detail, and I went over everything with a fine toothed comb.  Upper management noticed and called me into their office the next day.  They had talked with my co-worker and teammates.  They all agreed that I showed initiative a desire to lead.  With the success of the presentation, which brought a high-end client to our company, they promoted me to supervisor.  Our next presentation is next week and things have been going great.

I spotted someone interesting during the ceremony.  He had kind eyes and a great smile.  After the ceremony, the gentleman approached me at the bar and introuced himself.  He was the groom's cousin, Otto.    We spent the rest of the reception laughing, talking and getting to know each other.   We had so much in common!

What a roller coaster these intervening weeks have been. For the last 3 months I've had intermittant swelling and pain in my leg. Joe finally convinced me to see the doctor, after my usual fuss about useless tests. Well, turns out (after several rounds of all those ""useless"" tests), they found a blood clot! So the good news and the bad news. They can't operate (well, I guess that is both good and bad, since surgery is not on my bucket list!.) They can treat it with medicine (ugh, but I should be, and kind of am, grateful for that.) But the real killer (bad choice of words!) is that I have had to make some dramatic changes in my life style. That's good and bad too I suppose. I needed to make some changes anyway, as I know since retiring I have been way too sedentary. But the tricky part is: I need to walk daily, but not too much. And, I can sit and stand, but not for long periods of time. (Guess I will scratch off my bucket list flying to Australia...or any flights longer than 2 hours.) On the one hand, I am so grateful that this is treatable, and honestly, probably NOT what I will end up dying from. On the other hand, it is one more thing that I have to think about... a lot. Seeing that my besetting sin is worrying and anxiety, this does NOT help. But, I do see that this trauma (okay, maybe that is a bit dramatic) no longer shakes my faith like such things used to. That sign of spiritual growth is encouraging. Joe and other family members have been really supportive, as has our church and our friends. And, as is always the case, I'm praying and reading Scripture more. And, walking more and going to the gym. The most annoying thing is that I've had to set my alarm to make sure I don't sit for more than 1/2 an hour at a time...and of course, I have to remember to set my alarm! And each day slips by so quickly that sometimes I forget (Joe calls it motivated forgetfulness...ha) to go take my twice daily walks. But, making progress, so a good, or at least, okay thing in the long run.",,3ND9UOO81LOLNULCLDET660ISWMLW1,0.0

Religion has had such an effect on me, powerful and loving, that I want to spread the message to others. A couple of months ago I decided that I might even be comfortable enough with the teachings that maybe I could teach a class. I decide the best step for me would be to teach to adults, not to children. So, I signed up to teach a class this fall. Last week, I was preparing for the first lesson. I wanted to be extra prepared for next week, which is the first class, so I started early. Well wouldn't you know, I encountered a passage that really touched me deep down. I had read it before, but it didn't affect me the way it did a week ago. It was really touching, and really moved me. It said that I must adorn myself with righteousness. Righteousness, what's that supposed to mean, and why does it matter? Well, to be righteous tells us that we have to do the right thing ... to have good behavior. It does not mean that you have to be perfect. I caught myself crying, because for my journey so far, I have been so fixated on speaking the word of the Lord exactly as he said it. I was worried that if it wasn't exactly right, my students wouldn't buy into the story. But I was wrong... It's not about being perfect and just like the Lord. Only He can do that. It's about doing my best to teach others so that they can receive His love too, by following his teachings.",,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GEB0P8R,0.0

I lost him about 3 months ago. I have had him since I was 11 years old and I am 23 years old now. He was my best friend. So without getting into too many details he got into an accident with another dog. He seemed to by okay after it. We cleaned him up and checked for any bites that needed to be taken care of. Nothing major was found by my family and even my oldest brother who happens to be a veterinarian technician. But to make sure he gets better my brother gives us a list of medications to buy. We go get the medication the next day and begin giving it to. He still seems relatively ok at this point in time. We thought maybe he was just a bit tired which was thought to have been because of the accident. We knew it would take a couple of days so we wait. A couple of days later we see he isn't getting better. And his symptoms are getting worse. We take him to the vet and we get the news. He is really not doing well even with the medicine. The infection was getting worse. And because of his age our really option is to put him to sleep. We end up doing that and I watch as my best friend passes away. I still miss him and wished it never happened. I felt he still had a good couple of years of love to give me and my family.,,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GP2KP84,0.0

Life teaches many lessons. Each lesson has interesting story. For few, life is very easy. Such people are born with luck. But for the rest, life is real struggle. To them, life poses very difficult challenges for their own survival. Sometimes people come into your life and you know right away that they were meant to be there, to serve some sort of purpose, teach you a lesson, or to help you figure out who you are or who you want to become. You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, coworker, long lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger) but when you lock eyes with them, you know at that very moment that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those obstacles you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower, or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of luck. Illness, injury, love, lost moments of true greatness, and sheer stupidity all occur to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smoothly paved, straight, flat road to nowhere. It would be safe and comfortable, but dull and utterly pointless. The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience help to create who you become. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most poignant and important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being cautious when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back unconditionally, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things.",,3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ805UP17,0.0

Julie and her kids came to visit us today. This creaky home of ours always come alive when the grandkids come along. My daughter came over to give us our set of photos from the disposable cameras we had on our trip to California two or three months ago.    The photos turned out beautiful! John and I went to a few theme parks with the grandkids while my wife and my daughter went shopping at Rodeo Drive. Remind me never to say yes to Disney ever again or I'll end up 6 feet under by 65! Thank god I had my son-in-law to help keep the twins in check. I might've lost the kids one too many times but let's not let the missus find out. The twins made me wear a Mickey ears headband and got me joining them in the face painting queue. I never knew I'd look good with a tiger painted on my right side. Might have to bring that up to my wife and maybe get myself a new tattoo hah! It's unfortunate that the pictures we took at the beach did not turn out as good. It's probably because of the Sun exposure. Still, there's a good handful of photos of the twins messing around with me. Those rascals buried me in the sand and made me look like a mermaid when I was asleep! We had our annual sandcastle building competition. It was the twins and I versus Julie and John. It was obvious that we were going to win.... until the waves crashed into our castle. The girls cried but then John ""accidentally"" tripped and fell over their castle. We ended that day with a draw and spent the rest of the day swimming. I'm glad that I have these photos to look back on when things get rough. I don't have that many years left to my life but god, I only wish for safety and happiness for my family. Look over them for me when I'm gone.",,3NGI5ARFTURIDEK7GHIFUXJ81SE1PE,0.0

We love going to California anyway, but it was so much more fun with those little grandkids. My oldest grandchild is my granddaughter, and she is five years old. Her little brother is three years old. It was so much fun to see them having fun at Disneyland, and then at Universal Studios. It was even more fun to spend 10 days with them in a condominium right on the beach. Each day we spent playing in the sun, sand, and ocean. In addition, they loved swimming in the pool. Even though the kids are very young, we took lots of pictures so they should remember throughout their lives. I know that my wife and I will treasure it for the rest of our lives.

I filed for disability three years ago when I could no longer function in the workplace due to a chronic, progressive medical condition. I did not want to retire. My body did not agree with my wishes. My condition was deteriorating as I went through the three year legal process. I hired an attorney to help me understand the process and to ensure I was following the procedure correctly. Not only has it been frustrating not to be able to be employed financially, but it has taken a toll on mentally as well. I did finally qualify for my disability.  The entire process was very taxing on me. I was in a constant state of worry while going through it. I wondered what would become of me if I was denied my disability? I wondered how I would be able to receive any kind of medical attention if  I was denied. I wondered if I would lose my house when my savings ran out if I didn't get it.  I lost sleep during the three years because of the stress. The stress affected my physical condition as well.

He was saying things that didn't seem to match the way that he portrayed himself with her. She had met him at a bar, so she had no idea about any of this. She didn't even have a profile on any dating apps. I thought about the situation for a couple of weeks. I also asked for advice from some mutual friends.

I invited her out for drinks, and then I told her what I had found. She listened pretty patiently, but then she exploded on me. She didn't understand why I needed to bring this up.

We spent quite a bit of time apart, angry at one another. At least, I was angry at her. I don't know if she was angry at me, because she wrote me a message recently. Actually, she tried to call me a few times and then wrote a message asking me if I was alright. I wrote back and let her know that I'm feeling alright. We talked for quiet a while and she did her best to mitigate any angry feelings we may have between us. We talked about the time that we have been apart and we even touched on the fact that we had disagreed at one point. We didn't talk, at all, about the situation that led to the hurt feelings in the first place. Instead, we talked about what we intend to do going forward. We talked as though we are going forward separately, not together. She was very nice about the whole thing, and didn't say anything nasty. I didn't say anything nasty either. We both just talked as though nothing had ever happened. We talked as though we were no longer friends, but that we now have a history together. We talked like we knew each other very well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but I know that it was some kind of an evolution in our relationship. We now operate as two separate individuals, not nearly as close as before, but with a history that binds us together. Throughout the conversation, I kept trying to find some common ground. I desperately wanted to feel as though I were as close to her as I once was. She didn't reciprocate on that. She made a point to tell me that she still considers me a 'good friend' but never offered any new personal conversation that would support that idea. Instead, she made a point to ask me some very general questions, being careful not to get too personal or specific. She didn't ask anything specific, but I could tell that she cared how I was doing. That made if fell like there is hope that we can still be friends.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GO0ZDUG,,0.0

I didn't have the chance to really until just recently. About four months ago I took the plunge. I decided to visit a friend who I had known for a while and felt comfortable flying across the Atlantic for. I traveled from the US all the way to London, England. Traveling this distance was a bit nerve-wracking, but at no point did the nerves outweigh the excitement I had for this event. I seriously just was so excited and I couldn't imagine backing out now. After a lengthy flight, I met the friend and even though I had nerves meeting them too, I was still really excited to hang out with them. I wanted to hang out with them for a long time. I just couldn't believe it was happening. When we met, it was exciting and fresh and new. I couldn't believe I was so fortunate to be in the position that I was in. I got to see all of the sights, experience the food, and just spend some time in a culture that is different than mine. I encourage everyone to go through this if they can. It's an experience not soon forgotten.",,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GQ91UDJ,0.0

We were supposed to go out and do something and instead she ended up calling, for the third time, to cancel. I just unloaded on her, told her that I am tired of being the only active participant in this friendship. She gave me a sob story about how she's just been too busy to spend time with me.  I don't know if that's true, but I don't care.  She kept coming up with excuses and never even bothered to call me and ask how I was doing. So we had a huge argument and we have been angry at one another ever since. I haven't really spoken to her, other than just to say hi in passing, for over a month. She doesn't even seem to care, which hurts even more.  I regret that we had such a horrible fight, but I don't think it was my fault. I think that she could have easily spent some time at least writing me. She didn't even bother to do that, she just ignored me. I don't know if we will ever be good friends again. The fight was bad, but the time since has been even worse. She hasn't even bothered to try to clear the air or talk to me. I did try to talk to her a couple of times but she never responded.

When we finally landed and I saw my friend I knew the effort was worth it. I ran over and gave him a massive hug. I told him how much I missed him and he told me the same. When we got to his place I passed out almost immediately, due to not sleeping during the entire trip. I was incredibly exhausted from the whole experience, but I finally felt safe at his place. Afterwards we spent a lot of time talking and we spent the next few weeks seeing the sights of London. He told me all about his life there and I enjoyed listening to him talk. It was scary being in a new country but with him everything became easier. When it was time to go home he took me to the airport and gave me a big hug.

He drove us back to his place and my exhaustion finally caught up with me and after we spoke for a bit I passed out on his couch for a few hours. Luckily he was understanding of this. When I got back up we spent a lot of time talking. It was so refreshing to hear his voice again and listening to him tell me about how his life was in London brought me a lot of joy. I stayed at his place for over a week while we saw all the sights together. I was nervous a lot of the time being in a new country and so far away from home. I also felt a little isolated being around so many people from a different country than I. All of those feelings paled in how happy I felt being around him though.

The decorations I can still imagine in my head were perfect. The white theme and white hallway was breathtaking. The food was also amazing even though we didn't have much time to eat it. The rituals were also amazing since I got to see how they were performed  and the meaning behind it. The best moment was when I found the ring before her and won the game. The whole event kept a great smile in my face and was one of the most memorable events in my life. I got to marry the love of my life. She was also beautiful looking and breathtaking. I can see her nervousness and excitement through her eyes. We both had a blast in this wedding and can say was our best moment. The decorations, rituals, and customs made it even more beautiful.

We always wanted to go there. It was as nice as we expected. The water was warm and the colors were gorgeous. The atmosphere where we stayed was exciting. It was a romantic setting. The trip rekindled our sexual explorations. We decided to take a boat trip to an island where you swim and tan naked. We had always wanted to try this. We wanted the feel of being naked in the hot son and warm water. When we arrived there was around 25 people there. Some were couples while some were single. It was a small island so there was no hiding or privacy. We stripped naked after about 15 minutes. It was so exciting. The warm tropical breeze in the hot son aroused us completely. I almost instantly became fully erect. We waded into the beautiful water. There were people in the water already and i noticed a couple staring at my erect penis and my wife's beautiful ass and breasts. Her nipples were big to begin with but i have never seen them so erect and stiff as they were now. I came up from behind my wife and grabbed her breasts and started pinching her right nipple. Her right nipple is very sensitive and this immediately made my wife moan. I guided my hard penis into her from behind,we did not care who was watching. My wife grinded her ass against me and within minutes we both came hard. The orgasm was one of the most intense ones we ever had.",,3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GXJPDUH,0.0

We rented a car and to our surprise we got a good SUV, in fact they upgraded us so the trip was already starting on a good note. This trip was magical, unlike any other past trips we've been to. This was all nature and every scenery was different. It left strong impression on both of us. Further more my dad was super proud of how I planned the trip and that we managed to be in all the places we wanted (and then some!). We enjoy the restaurants and specifically a Chinese restaurant in Vegas - we kept going there for the days we stayed in Vegas. We took nearly 3K pictures and sadly the video we thought we took didn't work. Apparently the camera had a malfunction and even though it indicated it was recording, it didn't so all but two days of videos are gone. However, as I said, 3K photos are more then enough to conserve the memory of the trip. Some key highlights of the trip was when we walked in Monument Valley and encountered a snake, luckily we weren't in its path but both of use dislike snakes - we do respect them though. Another ""unfriendly"" incident was also in the Monument Valley are, next to our hotel there was a restaurant - I think it was called the Three Amigos but can't be sure. There was a centipede that my dad almost step on as well as street dogs which were super scary, reminded me of the movie Cujo by a book of Stephen King. Speaking of that restaurant - it was super good! So ""homey"" and my dad really loved the food style. In fact he was positively surprised by it.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GY6FDUI,,0.0

It was a gorgeous ride over and we enjoyed the view. As we hit the island, we rented bikes and got a map. We spoke to a couple of locals to get ideas what would be good to see. We headed toward Edgartown to see the Lighthouse. We rode the beaches we Jaws was filmed. We also happened upon an oceanside restaurant. We had a late lunch on the patio overlooking the water. It had great seafood. On our way back to our port town, we walked through the historic Victorian cottages that were built in the 1800s. The village is adorable and some have been in families for generations. It is much like the Mel Gibson movie, The Man Without a Face. Families spend all summer on the island. We shopped a bit and headed back to Cape Cod. It was a wonderful time with family.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CIH0K4K,,0.0

My aunt was trying the best she could to deal with her grief but had a mental break due to the stress. This was actually the best thing that could have happened to her. My aunt lost her only child tragically and suddenly a few years ago after losing her mother (my grandmother) 4 months before. She thought she was dealing with her grief and she probably was the best way she could at that time, but she really was not. She let grief take her over. It was extremely painful for me and our other family members to witness this. At one point she hit rock bottom and had a complete mental break. This ended up being the best thing for her and made her realize that she wasn't and hadn't been dealing with her grief. So she started making steps to start dealing with her grief and emotions surrounding my cousin's death. She seems to be on the mend now, but I still remain cautiously optimistic. She has made herself more stable both emotionally and physically and is taking good risks now. She is showing a bravery that I knew she had in her all along, she had just allowed the grief to take over. I was very close to my cousin. We were only 18 months apart and she was my only female cousin on both sides of the family. The loss of her hit me very hard as well and I tried very hard to not let grief take me over. Grief changed me. I'm not the same person and I don't necessarily have the same outlook on life anymore but I realize how difficult it can be to fight grief from overtaking you after such heavy losses and I'm so proud of my aunt for clawing her way back and starting to live her life again.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CIHBK4V,,0.0

She is excelling at school and meeting the demands of living in an apartment versus our house or a dorm with maturity.  She is so enjoying having a kitchen at any hour of the day or night.  She is branching out with her kitchen skills and making candy.  This is one of the ways that she manages her stress.  She is extraordinarily shy but is handling dealing with the leasing office with questions that have arisen and navigating an inconsiderate room mate issue. She is doing very well with her budgeting, paying bills on time, grocery shopping and preparing her meals.  She is fascinatingly frugal. It has now been 2.5 months since we have seen her.  Looking at the calendar with her because I miss her and want to visit she is firmly but kindly letting me know she has a lot of responsibility and a visit will set her behind and mess with her routine she has established.  She thrives on routines and a visit would throw hers off and be a source of stress.  Even though she misses us, she is self advocating for what she knows is best for her.  With Thanksgiving approaching I expressed concern about her being alone for the holiday weekend.  She let me know she is reaching out to a friend group to see who is around and making plans.  Then let me know she will be home for a month two weeks after Thanksgiving which is not far off. I am very proud of her and love seeing her mature on a weekly basis.  She is growing into be even more responsible and independent than I thought she would at this stage of her life.  And she's right.  She's got this.  She's been on the Dean's List each semester in a major so demanding the Advisors for it do not cheer them on but rather question their commitment since  most classes will not transfer to a different major.  Her tenacity and determination are awe-inspiring.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CJ2IK49,,0.0

Although it was something I knew was coming. It hit me very hard because I was far away in New York and I felt devastated not being able to say goodbye. It was and is the most shocking and painful experience in my life, mostly because I was told he had a few more months to live. Ever since I was little, my dad meant the world to me and I'm unsure how to cope with the loss. Adding to the event my abusive mother was around all the time abusing him and myself till the very last day. I've been trying to cope with this emotional moment with professional help. Distracting myself with other things that can help me move on. He had metastatic cancer diagnosed when it was already stage 4. I think this was too shocking but also gave me time to say sorry for anything I ever did and say I love you as many times per day as it was possible making sure he passed knowing how much he meant to me. At the moment he passed I was in New York for business. I wish I could go back in time and refuse to travel, I regret not being there the last day. Thankfully I have a brother who was there for him and made him felt loved. Now all I have left are the memories I built in the last months and sadness. Death is an event I have a hard time dealing with and is tougher this time more than ever.",,3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CK5CK4A,0.0

He has been hard working on this degree for the past three years. He really wanted his family to be there to see him walk across the stage and receive his diploma and celebrate with him. We all woke up pretty early that morning, around 6am, so that we could all go to his graduation. My son had to go ahead of us to prepare for the graduation with his classmates. So he got his robe, hat and tassel, and drove to the school ahead of us around 7am because the school was about 2 hours away. Me and my husband wanted to leave at 8am to make it to the 10am graduation. However, because of a ""bathroom incident"", we didn't end up leaving until 8:30am. On the way to the graduation, the traffic was okay and smooth. My husband drove a bit over the speed limit, but luckily there was no issue. We actually got to the school with 10 minutes to spare, but there was no more parking in the school's lot. We searched around for about 5 minutes and found a spot a couple blocks away. I grabbed my purse with the tickets and ended up having to run all the way to the school. We got there just in time to hear my son's name being called, and told my husband to quickly take out his camera so we could record the moment.

Well, the plan started out well and I got him ready and dropped him off at the venue. Just about that time, two  other nearby graduations were getting out and I was in gridlock. All of the stop lights were turned off and the police were directing pedestrian traffic. An hour later, I am no further than a half a mile where I dropped him off. I had no choice but to wait it out. I had to pick up his aunt and uncle. When I finally got out of the gridlock I just sped as fast as I could go! See, I never ever ever speed. I've being driving for 40 years without a single ticket. I was in a complete panic that there would be no time to get back. I zipped home in no time.

I watched a friend play DDR. And we just generally hung out and dicked around. It was a great night. We got back home and then as a giant group played some Jackbox. It was a helluva day overall where we all just hung out and did cool stuff. I'll look back fondly, because I don't get to hang out with people in person very often.

I had been spending a lot of nights over at his apartment already, so it made sense from that level.  But I just was afraid to give up my own space. I've been living on my own since college and it was tough to commit to living with someone.  I feel kind of bad because Bob actually had to work to convince me.  He said it was the right time to make that kind of committment.  And he also said that if we didn't jump in and try it we'd never know if it would work out or not.  He had a point.  I think that sometimes my fear of the unknown meant that I never took any risks.  So after giving it a lot of thought I decided he was right.  I need to just take this risk and give it a try.

Immediately, I made plans that I could do with my parents during my stay. I purchased gifts for my mom on the same day of leave approval. On my way to my mom's place, I witnessed an interesting event. I was on the highway. I saw something on the road a few hundred feet ahead. So, I slowed down. When I approached the scene of interest; it was a gang of deers crossing the road. The funny thing was there was a tiny deer moving slowly and others were surrounding it while moving forward in order to cross. I took the video of the event to share with my mom. After, 7 hours of driving I reached my destination. I hugged my mom who was extremely excited to see me after a long time. We talked about everything.

I talked with them and they told me some things about my grandmother that I had no clue about. She was so much more adventurous and daring than I had thought.

As a volunteer at the animal shelter, I was eager to attend the installation celebration event. I have been volunteering for the past five years. In the past, the animals played on a playground at the animal shelter that was covered with gravel. Although the animals had a good time playing in the secure playground, they often experienced discomfort when playing at the playground. Gravel would become lodged in the pets paws and often would create problems such as tender, sore paws. Also, gravel would be tracked indoors and created the need to do extra cleaning and facility maintenance. Even though the gravel posed some problems, the animals loved the playground just the same. Even though the animals did not mind playing in the gravel, shelter volunteers often expressed concerns about the gravel. When I heard about the plans to install green turf at the playground, I was beyond excited as I looked forward to saying goodbye to gravel. The green turf would make the playground better as the turf was more like the surrounding that the animals who were sheltered would play in if they were living in a loving home. When the day came the install the turf, I was super excited as I watched the gravel being removed and replaced with soft turf. After the turf was installed, the time came to let the animals out to explore their new playground. The excitement that the animals showed when they rolled around on soft turf was heartwarming. It was apparent that they preferred the green turf instead of the rough gravel. The turf was a welcome addition that the animals were ecstatic to enjoy. I thoroughly enjoyed the turf installation event. I enjoyed it just as much as the animals.",,3NPFYT4IZDQKQ2C1KRDZVX9HFE5GXM,0.0

I talked to several friends of my grandmother and they shared various stories and humorous interactions about my grandmother I never knew. I learned things about my grandmother from her friends that made me feel closer to my grandmother.

I hope I make my grandmother proud in how I carry myself as a person and my actions through life.

It was determined that one of the babies did not have enough amniotic fluid and her heart beat was indicating some stress with the mild contractions I was having. I began to panic thinking about all the things I had not completed that I desired to complete before the arrival of our twins. I was admitted to the hospital within the hour. I was hooked up to multiple machines and given medication to make labor move along more quickly. The pain became quite intense about 6 hours into this and I was given the option for n epidural, which my doctor stated was the best option in the event I needed and emergency csection. I opted for the epidural and when I was given the medication My blood pressure dropped so low instantly I passed out. When I woke I was surrounded by hospital staff and being given multiple medications. A few hours after this it was time for delivery and I succesfully and safely delivered 2 babies with no surgical intervention. We stayed in the hospital for several days. The twins needed a little extra help to ensure they were going to be ok with eating and gaining weight. Even though baby B was a footling breech delivery she was perfect and healthy. The hospital staff treated them like little celebrities because there had never been a natural twin birth in that hospital before and they were all in awe of the babes. The babies gather nuch attention every where we go. This has been quite a challenge for me as an introvert with a fear of small talk. Maybe someday when I have gotten a decent nights sleep it will come easier.",3NPFYT4IZDQKQ2C1KRDZVX9HXJ0XGQ,,0.0

It was a girls trip, so my husband and children were at home. This was the first time I had been on the West Coast and the first time in a long time that I had been away by myself without anyone from my family with me. The weather was amazing and I saw a lot of great things. We went on two tours, a Hollywood tour and a WB Studios Tour. It was really cool to see the back lots of WB Studios and even get to step foot on the stage of the Ellen show. I also got to see some of my favorite shows' sets and also got to see famous people's houses on the other tour. I also had some of the best food while there. We went to a restaurant that was part of LA restaurant week and I wasn't even sure what I was ordering, even with the descriptions. We went to another restaurant that wouldn't allow you to take pictures on your cellphones. That was really different, but great because it made us all focus on each other instead of technology. We also went to the beach and to an art museum. The beach was a great experience and it was the most diverse part of the city I saw. That was my first time stepping foot in the Pacific Ocean. I will never forget this trip because it reminded me that I'm still a person outside of work and family. I get lost in the daily grind and forget how to enjoy life. This trip made me so happy and I don't think I'll ever forget it.",,3NPI0JQDAPRJMYWGI02P0323K03TPI,0.0

I don't think God would mind if I missed one day, but I would certainly feel something was wrong if I did. Thankfully I saw the framed scripture I have on the wall and it reminded me.

It's at a nice company and I love my coworkers so far. I'm still working on amazon mturk as well on the side. I'm not doing as much as I was before but it's still a nice bit of extra income. I also thanked God for the family I have left. My brother stopped by the other day to check on me. I'm always glad to see him, I know he's having a hard time too and we can support each other. I bet mom and dad would be proud of us. Really though I think the Church is the biggest support system for both of us. They welcomed us in no questions asked and have been great for us. I think God really wanted us to find that Church.

We went on a camping trip to south Texas, by the Nueces river. My girlfriends family was able to get a tow-able camper for us to stay in, which ended up being a great thing because the weather hit over 100 degrees several times. I had brought a tent for my girlfriend and I to use, but I was glad that we were able to sleep in the camper instead because of the heat and humidity. During the trip we went fishing, canoeing, kayaking, and floating down the river. The water was pretty fast at times, but that made it even more exciting for us. Even though the weather was a little too hot, I was thrilled to spend some time with my girlfriend and her family. We have been together for two years, and our relationship has been a long distance one for the majority of that time. Because of this, I do not get to see her as often as I would like. We enjoyed the trip so much that we are thinking about going back to the same place some time in the near future. I would love to go in the fall (because it wouldn't be as hot), but if we want to go back when the weather is warm, I think we would have to go about a month earlier than we did. Overall, it was a great bonding experience for us all. My girlfriend and I cannot wait to go back. We had so much fun. In fact, we may plan a trip of our own next time.",3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRHWEM3YG,3NVC2EB65RL8WVQNU8SHVHRHWEM3YG,0.0

Their kids came with them, and everyone stayed at our beach house for the week. We had a great time together. We went to a lot of restaurants - ones they do not have access to in Alaska, where they live. They got to try fresh mahi mahi and other fish from warm, southern waters. They most they get is cod and salmon, although they get them fresh as well. My sister in law also wanted to do a lot of shopping. She loves the Florida beach look, so we did a lot of shopping in nice gift shops and such. She bought a lot of decor and gifts for people, stuff that really represents the beach look and sand and surf. They have ocean in Alaska, obviously, but definitely not the white sand and warm beach waters that we have here!  She also bought a lot of beach-type clothing, but since not is really appropriate for cold and snowy weather, she bought a lot of sweatshirts that said ""Florida"" on them. We spent a lot of time at the beach, which is my favorite thing to do. We showed them how to surf cast and fish for whiting and pompano and bluefish and sheepshead. We also took out our boat several times, and my sister in law caught a small black-tip shark! They really had a fun time, as did we. My brother in law even got me jogging again, since he is a competitive mountain runner and had to keep running while with us. He said the soft sand gave him a great workout! It was a really busy week, and it was a bit exhausting toward the end, but that's how it should be when friends and family come to visit. It was relaxing at times and harried at others, but all in all we had a fantastic time and can't wait to visit them in Alaska and continue our adventures. There is nothing like being with family and we want to continue to do this every year.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6P4M97S,,0.0

It was really early in the morning, maybe 6:30am. I stopped at a gas station I don't normally go to to pick up an energy drink before I went to work. Out the corner of my eye I saw someone vaguely familiar but just kind of dismissed it. As I rounded the aisles I saw him again, but a bit clearer. I was almost sure it was a friend I hadn't seen in over a decade. The last time we saw each other was in my hometown, and we hadn't spoken in many years. As I got a bit closer I could see it was him, so I called out his name. He looked up and immediately recognized me. Straight away he walked towards me for a hug and asked how I was. It was so weird - he'd moved here a few years before and me only a few weeks before, and he worked nights. Normally he was still at work at this time, so it was even stranger for us to bump into each other. We briefly caught up and then went our separate ways. We promised to  to meet up and hang out in the near future. It still kind of blows my mind that it even happened - I don't believe in fate, but things like that make me question it a little.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6PZ4970,,0.0

I have noticed that for the last several years, hotels have come around sniffing for locations. WHen you stand outside my village the view is breathtaking, and the spray from the waterfalls you can feel against your face. We live modestly in our village, everyone has a function. We also import things that we need and we have good trade with people on the outside. THe older people are not sure that the hotel chain is a good idea. Some villagers think that it will allow us to expand and take on more money from the outside. Others think that we will just be employed by the hotel and lose our way of life as we turn into servants. They also think that the natural beauty of the place will be destroyed and that is a shame just to bow down to corporate interests. I think that it would be a good idea and that nothing lives forever in the form that it is in. I walk through the forests of my village and hear the crunching sound of things underfoot. I wonder how much of the natural beauty of this place will dissappear. I then come to the conclusion that this place will be for the most part destroyed by a big hotel in this place. If we want to expand we can find things or manufacture things to sell on the open market instead of being hotel workers. I went back to my village and organized a meeting. After a day or two I think that I swayed the decision makers opinons that we should do something else and tell the hotel no, they cannot build here. After the meeting, we all went outside and looked at the natural wonders all around us. We watched the sun coming up through the trees as we heard the waterfall splashing off to our left. We heard the wildlife calling to each other through the trees, as the leaves rustled. We saw birds moving from tree to tree. As we took a deep natural breath collectively as a group, I decided that we made the right decision.",,3O6CYIULEENO6K86UR6UXTW1FJ2WUV,0.0

I said what are they looking at and then my daughter and I both realized my pants were torn and you could see my underwear. I am so glad I always wear clean underwear and thankfully they were the full size undies. I was so embarrassed. We rushed home and my daughter tried to walk behind me close so people could not see it.",3O6CYIULEENO6K86UR6UXTW1XP7WUU,3O6CYIULEENO6K86UR6UXTW1XP7WUU,0.0

One day I was watching TV and a beer commercial came on. It showed people relaxing and enjoying a nice cold beer. I had the thought that I missed being able to do that and thought that it had been long enough that I could handle a beer or glass of wine every now and then. I purchased a beer and handled it fine the first few occasions. However, soon my drinking became an issue. It got to the point where I had to have it daily and was drinking a lot quite regularly. My drinking quickly began to effect my family and work life. Within a few months, it got to the point where I knew it was unmanageable. That's when I reached out for help because I knew I couldn't quit on my own. I told me friends, family, and employers what was happening and told them I wanted to get help. I found a local detox center that I could check into for four days. I arranged for childcare for my children and put in for some PTO at work. I checked into the detox center and stayed for the full four days. They helped me with medications and counseling and gave me enough time to get all of the alcohol out of my system.

In January, I decided that I had been sober for long enough and was mature and responsible enough now that I could have a drink every once in a while in social situations. It all started with a beer commercial. I was watching everyone relax with a drink and they seemed so happy and carefree. I am a mother of five with a high stress full time job. I loved the thought of coming home and relaxing with a glass of wine. I went to the store and bought a small bottle. I had a few glasses and it was lovely. I didn't drink again for several days but when Friday came around, I bought another small bottle. I followed this pattern of drinking twice a week for about a month but things got worse really fast. Within a couple months, I was drinking daily. I started drinking so much that I would get the shakes during the day until I got home and could have a drink. It got to the point where I really wanted to stop, but I physically couldn't. Once I realized that I couldn't stop on my own, I reached out to my family and the owners of the Company I work for. After getting honest with everyone including myself, I decided to check myself into a detox center. It took me three tries to find one that would take me due to the fact that most detox centers are for low income people without medical insurance. For once, having medical insurance was actually a bad thing. Eventually, I found a treatment center that would work with me. I checked myself in immediately and stayed for 4 days. It was the best decision I've ever made. I learned that I can never tell myself the lie that I can have ""just one."" I am an addict and the only way to stay sober is to have none. I am happy to say that I have two and a half months alcohol free now and am happier than ever.",3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5PHEIX,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5PHEIX,0.0

I went to bed late last night since I could not get my mine off the big day tomorrow. I woke up in the morning feeling a bit tired, and at the same time I was a bit nervous. I was extra careful to select the proper clothing to wear. I made my cup of coffee and headed out the house. I arrived to work about 10 minutes early. I checked in with my supervisor and she was surprise that I showed up to work today. She instructed me to head to the break room to wait for her, and so I did. After sitting there for about 15 minutes, the supervisor came back to the break room and asked if I had received an email couple days before. She then told me that I was actually rescheduled to start tomorrow instead of today. I was quite disappointed and awkward that I actually went to work on the wrong day. I immediately checked my email with my phone and there it was, the email was there unread. The world began to feel it was collapsing on me. How can I make a mistake on my first day of work. I apologized to my supervisor and headed home.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QEJJEIW,0.0

Without warning, there were times I was hit with the sudden urge to pee and ended up holding it too long.  I knew that I probably had an infection, and I did.  I remember while I was waiting in the office thing that with my luck, it was quite possible that I would just wet my pants right there and then.  Holding my pee had become a regular habit for me.  It all started six months prior when I saw a family friend that I hadn't seen in awhile.  As soon as I saw him, my heart started pounding.  My stomach dropped to the floor and, of course, I had to pee right away.  All of the bad memories assaulted my mind in a matter of seconds.  The way he had sexually assaulted me those many years ago.  All of a sudden, it seemed like it had happened just seconds before.  So that was the day that holding my pee became a problem.  I wet myself and left in quite a hurry.  It was positively humiliating to me but I'm pretty sure no one else noticed because I left so quickly.  So now, it's a common problem.  I never know when it's going to hit me, but as soon as the flashbacks happen, the urge to pee always follows and I feel frozen in place trying to hold my pee.  I thought maybe it would stop after a few times but it seems to be going strong 6 months later and I'm at my wits end as to what to do.  The doctor had treated my infection but I suspected that I needed a therapist at this point.  Even though I'm feeling defeated, I'm also feeling oddly hopeful too.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QUCVEIA,0.0

We were really thrilled to head, earlier this year. We planned ahead, had everything booked and then set off. The weather was good, no snow was forecast which made for a pretty simple and direct trip. I really loved the drive heading to the apartment we were staying at. It was clean and pretty and had a lovely view. I guess what made the trip so special was celebrating being together, and living this life side by side, mutually. After a lot of moving around and seeing things we went on a nice hike. We saw some moose, and that was really special. They were enormous and they moved slowly and gracefully. We kept our distance of course! We went to a really awesome brewery, with a tour and we ended up winning a prize for knowing the answer to some question they had. After that we had arguably the best dinner we've ever had at a really beautiful, wood fired restaurant. Sleeping together as the snow came down outside made everything so special. Returning home wasn't all that bad because we had these huge, gorgeous memories to ourselves. It was a great experience and one I won't soon forget simply because of how it impacted me, how it drew us closer and made us happy to be together and to be able to share memories only the two of us have.

I asked her out to dinner and she said no, that her main and primary focus was on church. I then asked her about god, if she believed in everything the bible said and if maybe she would like to go out with me on a date to bible study and she actually said yes to both questions. A week later we met up at bible study and  after the lesson we had the type to sit and talk to each other about life, love and god. She told me that god is her first love and that she will always believe in and put God above everyone else in her life. I told her that was sweet and that I actually do the same, once she saw that I actually had the same beliefs as her she wanted to get to know more of me. It was sweet and romantic and we continued to meet up at church and bible study and we learned a lot about each other while also learning about each other. We would discuss God, the bible and our beliefs. We would talk about how the earth came to be, how we came to be and  the things that made us and the people around us similar. We both decided to join the church choir together and it was the best decision I have ever made in my life. Not only did it make her very happy but it made our relationship so much stronger, singing, learning and loving god together has truly been a blessing in my entire life. I never would have thought I would form such an amazing bond with someone and share the same views so much with someone like I do with her. I feel like she is my soulmate and our entire  relationship revolves around our religion and our love for christianity and the bible and I think that this is a beautiful thing. The bond we have created is amazing. I love her and God and they will always be very important aspects of my life. We still continue to go to church and bible study and sing in the choir to this day.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QXK0EIY,0.0

After we sparked up a conversation everything just happened. It just happened. We went from one topic to another and just couldn't get enough of each other. Eventually I quit my job and just ran off with her, we would talk for something like 7-10 hours a day. Religion played such a large role in our experiences. It was like everything in the world was speaking to us, through us, through the world, and through others. The biggest thing was music. We both experienced it, the music was just speaking directly to us. Not just interpreting it that way but like, everything was relevant to our moments together. Everything just flowed perfectly in perfect synchronicity, Everything was perfect. It was like, yea we had been waiting all our lives for this. And God just temporarily removed our blindness and we all celebrated our coming together. It was all just about love and harmony. Everything was just perfect.",3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1QXK0EIY,,0.0

It was like nothing seen here in living memory and no one was prepared for it. It came upon us suddenly with an unexpected snowfall. And it kept snowing, and snowing. That evening, we lost power. But we weren't concerned just yet. Around midnight, we were a little surprised that the power hadn't been restored. We were even more surprised that it was STILL snowing. And then came the cracking noises. We live in a forested area, so we are no strangers to the noise that trees make when they fall. It's a terrible sound. There are creaking and cracking noises, ripping and tearing; it's so loud, and it echoes. You don't know if a tree is falling at your neighbor's place, or right onto your own roof. Then comes the crashing thud as the tree hits the ground. Sometimes it takes out other trees on the way down and sometimes it takes out a structure or some utility lines. Trees cracked and fell all night and the snow piled up. More snow than we had ever seen here in our 16 years at this place-far more.  In the morning we were able to assess the damage. We lost dozens of trees and large limbs. All roads were impassable. Power and phone lines were down everywhere. We were stranded and had no means of communicating with the outside world. We hiked to our two closest neighbors to check on them. And then we waited. And it continued to snow.",3OB0CAO74IBNQ3XM9THJZBSRMNYYHR,,0.0

It was a surprise, though it had been coming for a long time. He did not, as one would say, go peacefully. But at least I can say he went into peace. It had been a long, slow slide down, with his claws dug into the side of the cliff, and he may have thought he was climbing some of the time. Since losing the use of his legs some twenty years ago, his life had become a daily struggle to perform even the simplest of tasks. The life that had become drudgery, with us, his daughters, the only bright spot, he'd somehow still wanted to keep. He'd dug his teeth in like a stray dog into a scrap of bone. Then, he had a heart attack while going into an MRI machine. He was dead for twelve minutes. But God sent him back from Hell, and not only that, but woke him up. That doesn't happen after twelve minutes. He was able to talk and respond to questions. Perhaps dying had killed the stubborn part of him. He was able to accept the peace of God, speak to his daughters for a whole week, and say goodbye. And then he pried his fingers off the side of the cliff so suddenly that I was the only one there to observe his fall.",,3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1ABA3XK6,0.0

It had been a lot of years since I had been in college. I was well out of my forties and into my fifties and decided to get my graduate degree. I applied and was accepted. I am so excited to be  in graduate school. I am loving every many of it.  My children are all grown up. My son graduated college. My daughter also graduated college also. They are both adults.

We knew he was sick - he had been sick for about five months, diagnosed with a rare case of bladder cancer. However, we didn't know how bad it was. On that dreadful morning, two weeks ago, his passing took us completely by surprise. Spot was acting his usual self, other than a lack of appetite and energy. He was still happy, friendly, and full of life. The doctor told us he had about a year to live, if he didn't make a full recovery. Our hopes were high, and we were hoping for the best. So was Spot. He knew he could over come it. But then the worst happened. Spot threw up about 3 or 4 times that morning. We knew something was up, so we took him to the vet. He spent his last waking moments on the vet bed. The doctor examined Spot, and told us that the cancer had spread throughout his body. Spot would not make it much longer. With heavy hearts, we decided to put Spot out of his misery, and let him go on to a better place. The doctor put Spot down, with all of us surrounding him for his last moments.",,3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1AMWEXK0,0.0

We have had several pets over the years. I loved them all but none affected me the way London did. She was a beautiful, blue pit bull terrier. We took turns walking her because our home is a beautiful mountainous area overlooking a huge lake and she especially loved meeting the neighbors on our walks. At first some of the neighbors were scared of her, pit bulls have a bad reputation. But London was special, she could capture the heart of anyone and everyone. She quickly because the neighborhood pet, as we would go on our walks the neighbors would stop to talk, not to us so much but to her and she would eat it up. She was beautiful, healthy, happy and energetic. So when we notice blood in her urine when walking one day, it was the last thing I expected the doctor to tell us that she had cancer. He prescribe her some medicine to give her that had a slim chance of curing her; it stopped the bleeding so we hopeful. She was full of energy, play in the water when my husband turned on the water hose she was all into it, jumping around in the water playing like a puppy again and whenever we would go anywhere she was right there with us bounding up into the car. Then about a month ago she started leaking and we had to get up in the middle of the night to take her out. Up until the day before she passed away, she was still playing in the water and bounding in to the car to go places with us. That same day she started throwing up and got to where she couldn't hardly walk. We knew she wasn't going to make it but still thought we had more time with her. The next day she passed away. At this time I am working on a project that keeps me occupied. At times I didn't even think about her but when it is time to take her walking or give her her medicine or feed her, she wasn't there. We needed to go to the store and as we drove away I looked in the back seat to see how she was doing but she wasn't there. It hit me then that she wasn't there anymore and never will be. I never want another dog. She was irreplaceable, one of a kind.",,3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1AMWEXK0,0.0

In the months prior to Kisses' passing I noticed she had become lethargic and wasn't her usual spunky self. She'd lost interest in playing. She stopped hanging out on her usual perches. Eventually stopped jumping on to the couch and even on to my bed. I was worried. Then, I began to notice her breathing become labored and wheezy. I made an appointment to have her checked out by her long time veterinarian and expected that he would give Kisses some antibiotics and tell me she'd be fine in no time. But, that's not what happened and I had my heartbroken to learn Kisses had lung cancer. The treatment she would have needed to survive was more than I could afford and I felt like I had failed her. I couldn't let her suffer. Watching Kisses struggle and not enjoy the things she used to was crushing and I knew it was because I couldn't afford to help her. At that point it felt cruel and selfish make her keep living in this condition, so I took her back to the vet and had her put down. I regretted it instantly. I wished I could take it back.

I have a thorough enjoyment of the bluegrass genre of music.  I even go online to catch videos of my favorite artists that performed at the festival I attended. That is how excellent the musicians were. Even revisiting some of the artists through a sometimes less than stellar audio and video, ie: uploaded amateur recordings, is still worth another listen! Any time I have the opportunity I look for other venues in my area that offer the genre. I am blessed to live in an area where the opportunities are abundant. What has really been exciting is finding out that many of the artists I admired for their talents are often performing in areas of the country close enough that I can both financially and physically attend some of the venues. I have continued learning guitar. I practice regularly.  I have discovered that playing is very therapeutic and a definite way to relax. I find an inner peace no matter what kind of day I have had. I have yet to find an opportunity to plan a musical vacation with my granddaughter. She is a busy young lady, college is on the horizon. But we now have another special reason to stay connected. We can talk about what we are learning and techniques we use to improve and progress in our abilities as 'guitarist's'.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LL6WAO6,,0.0

I had wanted to go for years but never was in time for tickets. They always sold out. This past year I watched carefully for when tickets became available and I bought them early! I anxiously waited for the concert day. When the event arrived I was at the front of the line. The performers were top notch and it was a night of first class music. The vocals were melodic and the playing ability of the musicians was the best you would find anywhere. Even though the tickets were rather expensive for my budget it was money well spent. I would do it again in a minute. As a matter of fact, I am keeping an eye out for the next concert! Also, my love of music has caused me to recently decide to purchase a guitar. My goal was to become capable enough to surprise my granddaughter. She has taken up playing the guitar and I wanted to be able to bond with her through music. She is now a teenager and communication is not as easy. Well, I have been practicing very hard for the past few months. So recently on her birthday, I surprised her with a birthday song. She was shocked and excited.  I hope to soon get her to attend some concerts with me as well as we both have a love of music.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LL6WAO6,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LL6WAO6,0.0

I didn't know her very well at all, just enough to see her and waive from across the street, but outside of initial greetings when we moved into the neighborhood earlier in the year, I had almost no interaction with her. But we were desperate, my wife's been sick but doing okay until her negative reaction to that chemotherapy. In that kind of bind, the offer to help with watching the dog since great. Sadie's a very friendly golden lab, I figured she wouldn't be much trouble for our neighbor Leslie to take care of and I'd give her some money to get the dog food while we were at the hospital. Well, it took a turn I wasn't expecting and I'm not sure what to do next. My wife is doing a bit better, but her time in the hospital has been tough on us both and she's not totally out of the woods. I go home almost every day, but I basically live at the hospital. And we still don't know many people in town who could help with the dog. But the neighbor is really becoming difficult and I'm afraid I need to get Sadie back from her right now and consider a new option. She's clearly taken to Sadie a bit too much and I think she might try to keep her once we get back. But this is our dog, we've had her since she was a puppy, she's a member of the family. We can't even imagine throwing away the last 10 years with her. She's like our daughter. But I can't just leave her with the neighbor any longer since I think the attachment she's formed is a bit too great. Last time I was home and I stopped over to see Sadie, Leslie had her dressed in a matching outfit to her. And there were pictures of the two of them up in the house. After speaking with another neighbor last week, I now realize that Leslie is widowed in the last two years and been on her own since. I think she might be lonely and Sadie has been great for her. But really, a bit too great. So I'm not sure what to do, but I'm certain leaving her there is no longer an option. I'm going to ask some people at the hospital if there are options for bringing her in with me or a kennel. Or maybe even a house sitter? I'm not sure about a house sitter because I'm not clear on how Leslie will respond to seeing someone else with Sadie. Quite a pickle we're in, but Sadie is part of the family and she's staying with us regardless, she can't become someone else's pet long term no matter how helpful it's been the last few months.",,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LUUNAOI,0.0

She also suffers from Fibromyalgia which was going to make the treatment much worse than it already is. She started the first round of chemo on a Monday and we spent 4 hours and 30 minutes in the infusion center. She was sent home with a battery operated pack that pumped chemo into her port 24 hours per day. Two days later (Wednesday) she woke and was very weak and very sick and a bit delusional. I had to leave for about 30 minutes to get her some medicine and when I got home she was so sick and in and out delusional that I decided to call 911 to take her to the hospital. Our bedroom is upstairs and I tried to help her out of bed to make it easier for the EMT's but she was dead weight even though she only weighs 128lbs. They arrived in about 10 minutes. Our little 3 month old puppy was downstairs in her kennel and was very nervous at everything that was going on. It was all so sudden but I tried to stay calm and figure out everything I had to do even though my first concern was my wife. Everything had to be moved out of the way so they could get the stretcher in the from door and up the steps. I had called my wife's daughter and she was on her way to our house and got there just about the same time as the ambulance. By this time my wife was quite delusional and had no idea what was going on or where she was. It was frantic. Three of them loaded her on the stretcher while I was giving a fourth all the pertinent information to be entered into a computer. I said I wanted to ride in the ambulance but they told me it was against regulations. They drove off with her with her daughter following in her car. I said I'd be right there. All of a sudden it hit me that I had to to something with our puppy. I heard a voice behind me saying ""sir, sir"". I turned around and there was a woman with a young boy and she said ""we live 2 doors down and if there's anything we can do to help, just let us know."" I explained to her a little of what was happening and asked if there was any way she could watch our puppy. I didn't know what time I'd be coming home from the hospital. She said they would be happy to, not to worry and they would take care of the puppy for as long as I needed. I gave her the keys to my house and thanked her profusely. As it turned out they took care of our sweet little girl for 5 days.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LUUNAOI,,0.0

I finally had a few days vacation and I was looking forward to spending the weekend at the beach with my girlfriend.  I had been spending a lot of times stressing about how I was going to look in my bathing suit and thought that maybe a good workout would provide the necessary motivation and confidence needed to feel better. After calling my girlfriend and making further plans to go out and to dinner and see a movie I grabbed my gym bag and headed out the door. I called my best friend to meet me at the gym. We had both made a commitment to get healthy a few months ago and tried to be each others personal trainer and cheerleader. I arrived at the gym first and sat in my car imagining all the fun stuff would would be doing on out vacation. When my friend finally arrived we got going quickly. My friend jumped on the treadmill and, after stretching I started with the weight bench.  I was in a great mood. I felt stronger than ever and so proud of how hard I had worked at the gym over the last few months. I noticed my friend jump o the treadmill and signal it was time to leave. As they opened a water bottle I decided to push myself had in the last couple minutes. As my friend stood watching I head a small pop. It didn't hurt at first but I was curious what it was. Immediately  The pop was followed immediately with the most extreme pain I had ever felt in my leg. I knew I had made a mistake. I knew I had pushed myself to hard.  I saw the concern in my friends face as they tried to help me up. Why had I been so stressed about how I would look in a bathing suit? As my friend helped me into her car on the way to the doctor, I realized my vacation would be ruined all because of my lack of self-confidence.",,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1,0.0

The 6 of us made a pact to take a cruise to commemorate the 10th anniversary of a cruise we took in school, and it did not disappoint. We decided on the Carribbean as a destination, and embarked on our journey, which provided several blasts from the past, and maybe even some glimpses at the future. Some of these guys I hadn't seen since school, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that many had gone on to exactly the kind of success we saw for each other. Some had become captains of industry. Others founded families. Some had seen unfathomable heartache. Some had achieved happiness beyond their wildest dreams. We reveled in each other's stories as we sailed into the tropics. The sights were incomparable, as was the company. There was a bittersweetness, as the passing of time was made ever apparent by the lines in our faces, yet it felt as though we'd never left one another. The memories came flooding back. Tears mixed with laughter which melted into tears again. We ate, drank and danced the days away until they became just too short. It's a journey I hope to make again whether it's 5, 10 or 20 years from now.",,3OLQQLKKNTBLB4BLXS8A4LGQRYCJEH,0.0

The most interesting woman was sitting and talking to my grandmother when I arrived. My grandmother introduce her as Edith and she moved here from Estonia shortly after the war.  She told me about how she been in some of the pride rallies back then. That she had seen Hitler speak before he came to power and liked him. It was interesting to listen to someone who was welcoming of the Nazi party when they invaded her country. But after learning of the crimes the Nazi's did feels sad about ever liking Hitler. We spoke for about an hour and she told me all about her family life during the war. I stayed until after lunch and took the same bus home.

I think all the time about how much of an impact it had. I have been able to stick to my goals for learning new skills, and I work through online courses every day. Right now, I am a few hours into a new Udemy course, which has been challenging. I feel concerned about the challenges that lay ahead but am just taking things one day at a time. While my goals have shifted a little bit since the internship (I have decided to focus on a different path than the Excel stuff I had been working on), the motivation and perspective have stayed. My life is changing rapidly in the wake of this. I have put my love of video games and music on the backburner, because they were getting in the way. It seems like sometimes you can't dip your toes into life - if I want to succeed in this career change, I will have to devote myself to it. Knowing that someone believed in my potential has helped me believe in myself and this is just the first step. I've begun networking outside of my company to find other opportunities. I got my library card so I could check out books about the subject matter. I've made a few difficult financial decisions, knowing that I will need savings and stability in case anything comes up. I guess you just never know what is going to happen in life... just a couple of years ago, programming and data analysis seemed like a form of magic that I would never comprehend. Now, it makes more sense every day. I hope one day to look back on these diary entries and know that I'm still pursuing this. Maybe the internship itself wasn't the path that I wanted but it certainly opened other doors for me.",3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY7Z644WP,,0.0

So Avengers it is? hahaha. After the movie, It got dark out, and I wandered around town and got lost. I was trying to find a way back to the hotel, but Legazpi was a bit difficult to navigate by foot. This guy in his motorcycle-sidecar taxi/tuk-tuk zooms up to me, and asks if I'm lost. I say I'm ok, that I don't need a taxi. But he insisted I enter his tuk-tuk; that he'd take me to the town festival that was going on for free. I obliged, and he sped off with me inside. He goes, ""my friend, you were about to get mugged by those dozen squatters.""He may have been fishing for a fare, or maybe he wasn't. To me though, his face and demeanor genuinely came off as a hardworking super nice guy. If he didn't, well.. then I applaud him for being an amazing actor and he's in the wrong line of work. And yes, he took me to his tiny friggin shack of a house near the ocean for dinner. His wife was cooking, and he had two tiny kids running around happy their daddy is back home. We ate a great meal, and he dropped me off back at the hotel. No charge. What the hell!! Take my $20!!! Nope. Ok fine, how about $40, and you show me the Mayan Volcano and all the cool stuff around here tomorrow? He accepted. Next morning comes around, he shows up at my hotel. We take off and he takes me to these Dutch church ruins that got decimated by a volcanic eruption in the 1600's or 1700's, hiked all around these awesome caves, and strolled around the black sand beaches. We had a hell of a time. I give him $60 USD (hid another $20 behind another $20 lol; as the bills were crisp enough that you can kind of make it seem like one bill).",3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RR344BOL,3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RR344BOL,0.0

He had to be put to sleep because he just turned 3 and they had to have him stay still and quiet for about an hour to be able to get accurate results.  We had to drive about an hour and a half away to have this test done because not just every place does them.  We had to go to a specialty children's hospital.  I was very nervous because he had never been put to sleep before and actually hadn't even ever been in the hospital since he was born.  I was upsetting to me when I walked in the room and it looked just like a regular operating room.  They gave us all the information about the procedure and then it was time to get started.  We laid him on the table and had to hold him down while they put the mask with anesthesia on him.  He was trying to scream but nothing would come out.  It was a horrible experience and he was stating up at as wondering why we were helping them do this to him.  It was absolutely heartbreaking.  After about 30 seconds he was asleep and they put the IV drip in to keep him sleeping while they preformed the test.  We were unable to stay in there for the test but it didn't last as long as they thought it would, only about 40 minutes.  They called us back in and gave us the results that his hearing is fine and then we just had to wait for him to wake up.  That took about 15 minutes for the anesthesia to wear off and him to awaken but once he did they gave him some just and we were able to take him home.",3OS46CRSLGLQPKI08Z3VVLZ7WT66VI,3OS46CRSLGLQPKI08Z3VVLZ7WT66VI,0.0

It starts with a husband who made it terrible mistake by having an affair. It's about a wife who found out and obviously was devastated. Unfortunately it's the kids who suffer the most, as they have to deal what's the consequences that are outside of their control. This is about a husband who has sought counseling, has apologized constantly and has tried to show that he has changed. This is also about a wife who cannot bring herself to forgive. So then what happens to the family? The wife states that she is going to divorce him, yet can't bring herself to actually do it. You have a husband who is stuck in no man's land. The husband will not file for divorce. Which puts the family in a trap that no one can seem to get out of. The parents are separated, the family is separated, do they still do things together. No one can seem to move forwards together or a part. It is a family in crisis, that they can't seem to get out of. So where does this family go from here? And how can this family move on, when 1 person wants nothing but reconciliation and the other person can't make up their mind. And in the middle of this, are two kid's who just want their family back together.",3OS4RQUCRA17ZZD54BFZOFIDM1EBF7,,0.0

We connect together, have great times, and get along fairly well. However, I noticed that he likes to drink alcohol and when he drinks and he's stressed he becomes belligerent and just flat out mean. One night it got so bad that he was forehead to forehead with me screaming in my face. Talk about how little I felt. He began kicking furniture and throwing stuff. He was even screaming and slamming doors while my 4 year old was asleep in the next room. This was just disgusting to me. Someone that I learned to love and care for was treating me like a dog for no reason. It really sucked because I do everything for everyone in my household except myself. I cook, clean, do the laundry, shop for them the clothes that they need, and run the errands. I never ask for anyone to do anything for me. For someone who I seen as so good-hearted and loving to treat me like that was astonishing. It really made me question my decision to be with him and wonder if it was the right thing for my son. We had just made announcements with an engagement shoot to put on Facebook too. I hated to tell the whole world that we had broke up after just being engaged.

We knew that Jeff has always had a deep interest in airplanes since he always tells us how he wants to be a pilot when he grows up, and Todd really enjoys being lazy on the beach. After my wife and I took off work for a couple weeks during the month of July (before the boy's birthdays), we both thought it would be a great idea to make this whole trip a complete surprise. We planned to travel to a beach for Todd's sake and that it be far away enough from home so that we'd be able to board an airplane for Jeff's sake. So, after endlessly searching for the best prices and deals for airline tickets and hotel rooms, we finally landed (no pun intended) on really cheap tickets that were about $350 each round trip with a hotel room included in the package deal. My wife and I were very excited to reveal the plans to our kids when their birthday came around, but at that point in time, we were just hoping that neither of us ""spilled the beans"". Two weeks later, it finally was time to reveal the big secret. As soon as Jeff and Todd woke up in the morning, we happily wished them both a happy birthday. After seeing the loving smiles on their faces my wife and I knew it was time to make their day even better. This was the most memorable moment that I could remember, when we told the boys about the trip we had planned they both leaped out of bed and hugged each other and yelled out of excitement. Neither of the boys had been on an airplane before so this was going to be a brand new experience for them. Seeing them so overwhelmed with joy brought so much love to my heart that day. I also remember the way that the kids packed up their suitcases the day before we left for vacation, it was surely a sight to see. They were so full of energy that they piled all of their clothes and toys mindlessly in one large heap in the middle of the suitcase, they wanted to leave as soon as possible no matter how disorganized they were! My wife and I sighed with relief that neither of us ruined the surprise for them as we both watched our children prepare for one of the most exciting trips of their lives at the time.",,3OVHNO1VE7N6JD2PJJ0CMXMVZ15ZDT,0.0

A Fed-Ex truck drifted into the far right lane, slammed into a semi-trailer, careened to the other side of the highway, and flipped over in a loud crash in the center lane. Everyone screamed when it happened. Luckily for us, we were at least a half a mile or so back, so our vehicle wasn't involved in the accident, but a mid-sized sedan was completely crushed on impact. We were all shaking at what we just witnessed. Everyone, including the floor manager was in complete shock. We couldn't decide if we should stay put, or get out and try to help, but for certain, we all called for help on our phones. We were trapped behind  the wreckage, as there was no exit on this stretch of highway, and we certainly couldn't go backwards. So we stayed put and watched as everything unfolded in front of us. We couldn't hear what was going on, but we saw the people who were closer to the carnage, get out and try as much as they could to help. The Fed-Ex driver was dragged from his vehicle, and we say many people try to lift the carriage of the crashed truck off of the mid-sided sedan. The semi-trailer driver emerged from his vehicle, very shaken but otherwise seemingly unharmed.  The contents of the Fed-Ex truck were all over the highway, littering the stretch of road with tons of boxes.  Everyone was afraid for the people in the mid-sided sedan, and praying that, whoever they were, they were ok. It was one of the worst things I had ever witnessed, and I will never forget it.",,3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GL8YPQ4S,0.0

She was in an assisted living facility where she had been for two years due to increasing dementia and heart related health issues. One week we went to go to an event that was held at her facility that was supposed to be a family dinner and celebration. My grandma would not get out of bed to attend. This was very unlike her and from that moment on for the next three weeks she gradually stopped getting up at all, eating, and finally drinking. A few weeks before her death she was put on end of life care, hospice, and I made it a point to be at her home every day for several hours a day helping to care for her. This was both heartbreaking and beautiful all at the same time. To be able to care for someone who cared for me almost my whole life was very eye opening and humbling and extremely emotional. This was the woman who I thought walked on water and here she was now unable to do even the most menial of daily living tasks. How the tables had turned. A few days before she passed she became sort of comatose as she stopped drinking water and responding to anything other than pain, and a lot of pain she had. It was such an honor to be a comfort to her while she was in the transition from life to death.  The most memorable part of this was the day before she died, where she had been no responsive for several days, I started to talk to her about my childhood and what a huge influence she was on me and how much I loved her and wanted to model my life after hers. I told something funny that happened when I was a child. I knew she heard me because she fluttered her eyes and she made a half grin. I will forever be grateful for these last moments with her and I will remember them as long as I live.",,3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLS6Y4QF,0.0

I asked him if he knew why black people even wore some of those hairstyles, (they're protective hairstyles). My dad said something that disgusted me to my core. He said, ""To keep the bugs out?""

All of my kids were very impressed.  The birthday boy decided that the roaring was for him. The Grizzly Bears were also a hit with the kids.  We got to see the zoo staff feeding the bears. My children all laughed at the way the bears would go ""bobbing"" for apples when the staff threw them in the wate.   After the zoo we came home and my son got to open his presents.

Since he was diagnosed, his condition has progressively gotten worse over time: he has difficulty controlling his bowels, suffers from poor energy levels, has difficulty keeping food down, etc.. He has gone to numerous doctors and has had several procedures performed, but his health has continued to decline. Still, he managed to remain mostly independent until sometime this year. Approximately 2 months ago, he had his first incident which required a 2-3 week stay at the hospital. He fell ill while at home and 911 was called to bring him to a local hospital. When I found out about the incident, I was basically forced to pick up responsibilities around my parent's home. This included picking up and helping drive my mother to and from the hospital on a daily basis so that she could see my father. It also included having to handle grocery shopping and basic household chores, such as doing the laundry, taking out the trash, and general housekeeping since my mother was frequently at my father's bedside in the hospital. All these sudden and additional tasks were a heavy burden on me because I had to juggle them in addition to my own normal everyday tasks. The incident also added an emotional burden because I now had to worry about my father's physical well-being while at work. I couldn't plan too far ahead in advance because I knew I had to be on call and be available whenever my parents needed my help. I was no longer taking care of my own affairs and I had to refocus my energies on helping my parents get through their difficulties before I could attend to my own. Since then, my father's condition hasn't really improved. Although he has returned home, I'm still on call at all hours in case he has another incident. I have had to take him to the hospital again on multiple occasions and his doctors say that he should be brought back anytime he feels unable to resume his daily activities.",3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWFNDLOR,,0.0

I finally decided to cash in some stock that I had and set up the trip for our 25 wedding anniversary.  I thought about it and chose the islands that I thought my wife would enjoy.  And I had one special island for me.  On Rangiroa 27 years ago I took many pictures of the black tip reef sharks, a very few with mine and many more with another person's camera.  I only had one that came out ok.  So I wanted my shark pictures.  We went to the airport early and took our first plane to Los Angeles and got on an afternoon flight to Papeete.  Our first island stop was Moorea, where we spent 7 days in an over water bungalow.  The Moorea of today saddened me because 27 years ago it was pristine and uncrowded.  Not now.  Next we went to Huahine, where we found the French Polynesia of 27 years ago.  Few cars and few people and absolutely beautiful.  I actually stayed in the same hotel that I had stayed in 27 years ago.  We had a great time there and rented a car to drive around the island. Bora Bora was our next stop and it was pretty much the same as it was 27 years ago.  It looks really nice flying in, but not so much on the ground.  We had decided not to get an over water bungalow there because it was too expensive.  But when we got there, we were moved into an over water bungalow at no additional charge.  We left after 3 days to my ultimate destination, Rangiroa.  We were staying a very nice hotel with our beach bungalow facing out to the crystal clear blue water.   Then on Sunday we went out to the Blue Lagoon where not only did I get shark pictures, I got shark videos.  I had tears in my eyes on the ride out because after 27 years I was finally going to get my shark pictures.  It was a rough ride, but we got to the blue lagoon and I was overjoyed. This was the trip of a lifetime and I only hope we can make it back one more time before we get too old.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,0.0

It's amazing how people can get into completely avoidable accidents. It is some coincidence that we were at the right time and the right place to see the accident happen. I can't recall the last time I saw an accident happen as it must have been many years ago. However, I am glad that we were there so that we could offer help. One of the driver's was in bad shape and needed help. Being aware of the fear and panic that can cause bystanders from stepping in and helping during a crisis, we decided to get out to see if we could help save the driver. We are not sure if the person that came up to us for help was with the driver when the accident happened, but apparently she was a friend of the driver. She was noticeably panicking and losing control. Based on experience during a emergency, I knew the best thing for her to do was to be calm and rational. I tried to ease her nerves and offer her reassurance. She was grateful and wanted to contact us later. That ended up not happening as there wasn't anything in return that we were in need of. I wonder what happened to the driver and the driver's friend. I hope that they are okay and that they can avoid getting into accidents in the future.",,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB,0.0

We decided to go the back way since it has less traffic and we can avoid the highway since we were pulling the trailer. It was a 2 lane road with a few sharp turns. When we were driving near the one big sharp turn, we saw a SUV flying around the corner and I thought ""this is awful fast for the SUV to drive like that"". Right about 2 secs after we saw the SUV, it lost control and rolled off the road. IT was horrible because that was my first time saw a real accident like that happened. The SUV rolled into the bushes, and we were the only two people there at the time. We parked the car off the road, called 911 and ran over. The guy passed out, we couldn't really pull him out that easy since the SUV was on the side, so we had to climb to the top of the car and lift to open the door and try to lift him up. Meanwhile there was something in the back of the car that was making the hissing sound, like a gas tank. I was so scared and my friend told me to stay away from the car while he was still trying to get the driver out. Finally after about 5mins, there were some other cars drove by and saw what happened, they stopped and started to help my friend. I went to check on what was making the noise and it was a tank but not has tank. I told the guys who were helping there that to remove the tank first to make sure it is safe. Then I was there try to direct the traffic. Then there was this car drove up, stopped, and a woman ran out of the car and started to scream and cry. She came to me and I held her and she was crying so hard and she was telling me ""I told him he shouldn't be driving"". Then I knew it was someone she knows. I was really sad but I tried to calm her down and I told her that ""he looked ok, he had safety belt on, probably just passed out, he will be fine. Trust me"". I was really calm at the time, I didn't know how did I do that, I guess I was trying to calm her down.  Then later the cops were there, they thanked us, we gave them our contact information in case they need more information about what happened and then we left. Later that day we saw the woman on local news and she thanked us on the news and she wanted us to call her but we never did, we thought we just did what we should do and we don't need anything in return.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS72ABBB,0.0

I am trying to find the positive in this very stressful time. We thankfully have insured the house for the damages of the tornado...and all 40 of our rescued cats are recovering from this traumatic event.  Trying to find cats in a large home (when the power is out) is a very daunting task. Most of our feline friends instinctually sought refuge in the basement, which was a great help. A handful had to located and dragged from the smallest hiding spots. I went around with a flashlight looking everywhere I could think of...only receiving a few scratches (...which reminds me I need I trim Mr. Sprinkles nails today). I am so thankful for the radio and cell towers that still allowed me to communicate with others during those stressful moments crowed in the basement with stressed-out kitties. Hours later after the tornado left, our sister-cat rescue arrived with salvation. What a blessing! They able to help up transport our cats to their location while we rebuild our own rescue. Their timely aide left us forever grateful. Hoping to rebuild our place with the insurance money and aide from the community. Or we try to find a new vacant house all together. In a way, this may be a much needed way for us to expand our cat rescue with new ideas. Lots to think about and a lot to be grateful from this tornado experience.",,3P4RDNWND6SXR9D7TBY1P0EI0KHJIR,0.0

Her cardiologist came to see her that evening at the hospital and decided to do a heart catherization. As a result of the procedure, the major artery in her leg became blocked, and she lost feeling in her leg as it began turning blue. The cardiologist injected her with a large amount of blood thinner which helped get some circulation to the leg and sent her over to a different hospital which had a vascular surgeon. The surgeon had to do a somewhat radical procedure of cutting deeply down both sides of her lower leg, as well as locating the blockage and removing it. The leg had been without circulation long enough that swelling was going to be severe, and without the cutting, the swelling would have killed the nerve in the leg. It took 4 to 5 months for her to recover enough to walk without aid of a wheelchair or walker. In that time I had to take care of her in between nurse visits, including all home maintenance (cleaning, cooking, laundry, etc). I was confined to home as well as she was because she couldn't be left alone. It was a tragic experience for her, and a shocking one for me to see the extent of the surgical damage and the slow healing process. The process for my wife was excruciating. Nurses came by every day for 2 weeks to change the dressing on her leg. Then for months after, twice per week. Also, once a week for months my wife had to go to a clinic to be evaluated by a wound specialist. At times the treatment was very hard to endure, especially the wound vac which seemed to cause as much damage as it did good.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIW5CLF6,0.0

Baby Kitty could usually be found in our daughter's presence.   Whenever she would get upset, Baby Kitty would help calm her down.  When we finally found her she couldn't even stand up.  We got her to an emergency vet right away.  He told us we were lucky we got to her when we did.  With the snowstorm coming, it wouldn't have been good if she got caught in it.  The vet made a splint for her hind leg, apparently Baby Kitty broke it, we don't know how.  The vet believes a car might have nicked her.  My daughter brought in a notepad to the vet so she could take down notes for Baby Kitty's recovery.  At home, my daughter declared that she will take care of Baby Kitty to make sure she gets better.  Two weeks have gone by since the incident, and Baby Kitty is doing a lot better.  The vet wants to see us in another two weeks to take some x-rays to make sure the bones are healing well.  True to my daughter's words, she has taken care of Baby Kitty and sees to her every need, when Baby Kitty lets her.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIYUGLFQ,0.0

Instead he told me that Joan was leaving and I was the best candidate for her replacment! He asked me if I would accept the job. Of course I did.  This is so wonderful! I didn't expect to be doing so well this early on in my career! I've only been working there for almost a  year. This puts me so far ahead of my plans of buying my own house.

It was back to school season and time to go get things for that. When we came out of the store, we heard a whimpering coming from a car. There was a small dog looking back at us. The poor thing was so thin and looked like it hadn't had a good meal in months. We took the dog home with us and cleaned him up. The next day, I took him to the vet to see if he was micro chipped or anything like that. Turns out, someone had brought in the dog's brother. Someone had dumped both of these poor things and left them to starve. You know I hate people like that and it just pissed me off that someone could do that! I ended up asking to adopt them both. I wanted to give them both the best life that I could! Thankfully, I was able to do that since they both were not chipped. Spanky and Muttons are doing really well now.

This happened at the street.  this has happened to me so many times but this one time had a big difference ill specify later in my writing. I was walking around with my son it was sunny and a little bit windy we were eating an ice cream and sharing some jokes.  All of sudden i saw a tail from underneath a car , I told my son to help me see what that was , he told me not to move and he went to look for whatver it was moving. I was so nervous because I was so sure it was an animal and it was probably hurt so I felt scared and sad at the same time. I heard my son saying something I couldnt understand followed by the winning of this tiny little white thing , it was the most beautiful thing , a tiny white ball of fur. I felt so in love and scared for him , it was a boy. my son and I took him to the vet and after he got all the shots and a full check up and we were told that he was in perfect shape we decided to took him with us to our home. we made the decission to call him Max it sounded powerful but with a lot of character just like i think his personality is. he ate so much the first 3 days it seemed like he wasnt eating much the time he spent at the streets. After 2 days we got a phonecall from the vet , they told us that they found the brother of the dog we found , we couldnt believe it , so now we didnt know what to do. We had a long conversation about separation and what damage that could do to anyone and that includes pets , so we decided to adopt the brother as well . We now live in a house with 2 lovely dogs. we instead walking alone we walk with both of them , they are so protective of us, and like to play a lot, we are so blessed we got the posibilities of taking care of them.",3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHGX2TE,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHGX2TE,0.0

Just try to get here as soon as you can.”All of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic. My hands were shaking as I quickly removed my daughter’s car seat from the shopping basket and hurried toward the car. I was amazed at the superhuman strength I had in that moment. You don’t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you’ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter’s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn’t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . “Mark! My dad… My dad died.” Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment. Nobody else really loves you as much as they did. It’s a really difficult thing to come to terms with. It seems inconceivable that someone who’s been there for us since day one can suddenly be — gone.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAS5ET2B,0.0

It's in one of the roughest parts of my state and it's always nerve-wrecking going there. After drive twenty minutes I finally arrived to sit in a pool of jurors and wait for instructions. During this time I was doing work on my laptop and after hearing my number called I went to the courtroom with the other jurors to see if we were going to be called. After getting dismissed and sent back downstairs, I decided to purchase a muffin. It happened to be a banana nut muffin, unknown to myself. Instead of eating the muffin at the courthouse I waited until i was dismissed completely and on my way home to eat it. Luckily. As I arrived home I decided to eat the muffin, but after taking a few bites I noticed something crunchy. I thought I purchased a banana muffin, and soon after realized it was a banana nut muffin. I happened to be allergic to walnuts and didn't think twice about how bad it would affect me. After trying multiple solutions to get the nut out of my system, it was to no avail and I ended up calling my mom and having her take me to the hospital. My vision was blurry, my throat was closing, and I felt like I was dying and I was so dizzy. Once I finally arrived, they new to take me to get treated right away, and I was lucky enough to book a room at the hospital. They injected me with a few drugs and I was able to sleep better.",3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT16O7GA,,0.0

When I drove down there, there happened to be a long line just to get in. While waiting in line I was talking to a really nice lady and she was telling me about the business she owned and how she didn't want to get called in because she was going on vacation soon. When once we were all inside and the announcer told us which rooms to attend we waited for our names to be called over the intercom. As the called our names, mine happened to get called and I was so nervous. We walked to the courthouse and waited to be called in. Once we were called in we heard about the criminal case with the criminal standing right there with his lawyer. Then we had to fill out a survey to see if we would get called in. Once we filled out the survey we were dismissed for about 2 hours. I went to purchase a banana muffin. After that I hung around until we were called back into the courthouse. After being called back in, I was dismissed and not need for the case. I went back to the waiting area and after about two hours we were dismissed altogether. I was so elated. As soon as I got home, I decided to eat the muffin as I was too nervous to eat it in the courthouse. After I bit into the muffin, I notice there was something crunchy in it. It turns out it was a banana nut muffin. NOT just a banana muffin. Which would be fine if I wasn't allergic to nuts. Well, after I realized that there were walnuts in the muffin, my throat started to close which landed me in the ER room as I was on the verge of suffocating. About 5 or 6 hours later I was release and grateful to be alive.",3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT16O7GA,3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT16O7GA,0.0

Every day I am worried about climate change, but I haven't been sure what to do about it. At the beginning of this year, I got involved with Extinction Rebellion. It seemed like a group that was treating the climate crisis with the urgency it deserved, but in the end, they were struggling to gain traction and find a direction. I left the group because it was stressing me out even more. I had heard about Sunrise Movement, seen them on social media, but really got intrigued when I saw they were organizing a summit and protest in Detroit to encourage the DNC to hold a presidential debate focused solely on climate change. I signed up to attend the summit, rented a car, and drove four others 300 miles to Detroit. The summit was amazing! I met hundreds of people, most younger than me, well informed on the climate issue and enthusiastic about doing something. Participating in the training and protest was incredibly uplifting. It has given me hope that we can make an impact in this fight. Back home, I've become involved with my own Sunrise hub, even giving a short speech at a recent event. We went to occupy our local DNC office, but nobody was even there. They were downstate at the state fair. I was discouraged, but the others were not. They called it a success. I am enamored with their optimism. I can't wait to keep organizing with these people.",,3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT22C7GR,0.0

The message was very generic and random telling us that she had some important news about daycare moving forward. She ended the paragraph with a sad face and sent it around noon that day. My wife and I went into an immediate panic and started texting each other. Unable to wait and wanting to know what the issue was, my wife texted immediately. She let us know that we would be needing to find new daycare and that she is closing down. We would have 2 weeks to find something new including over the holiday weekend which drastically limiting the time we had. This was terrible unexpected after roughly 4 years of watching our daughter. Really wish we had month or more and not right as school is about to begin. We immediately began reaching out to daycare providers and to no avail they have all been full. So far that was an entire day while working trying everything from social media to find a safe place for our daughter to be while we work. This drove both of our stress levels out the rough and has made the day very difficult. This is just one of those things that happens unexpectedly but I truly hope for the best.

I loved getting to know her friends and her fiance better. The next day we spent most of the day getting ready for the wedding. We went and got our nails done. We went to lunch together. We went to the church and began setting up for the wedding. The day of the wedding we went to the church early so that we could get ready and relax as well. We had so much fun watching each other get our hair and makeup done. When it was time for the actual wedding we got a lot of great pictures. We told a lot of jokes to try to keep our nerves calm! The actual wedding was beautiful. Everything went smoothly and not one thing went wrong. After the wedding we had a beautiful reception with great food, a picture booth, and lots of great friends getting to chat. It was one of the best events I have been to in a long time. This story is significant to me because my friend has risen above her circumstances to find happiness, and I love that.",3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K,3PDJHANYK62L7JNG3AMRGK8YLVHH6K,0.0

I appreciate that a lot as a woman who is not knowledgeable about cars and who always is afraid that mechanics are going to take advantage of me. The only thing I don't like about this auto shop is their parking lot and location in general is very cramped. There is not a lot of space to pull out or move. So I go to pick my car up and as I'm trying to back out of the parking space I left it in, I hit the dumpster behind. Immediately my car starts making a horrible noise. I can't believe it...I got into an accident right after fixing my car, before I even leave the mechanic shop! I go back inside in tears and tell them what happened. Get this...they look at what happened and fixed it for me, for free! I was shocked and amazed at their kindness and generosity. I wanted to pay them back, but I had to borrow a small amount of money for it, so I went home and talked to my sister to ask her to borrow money. I went back the next day with cash for the mechanic who fixed it, because I hate to be a damsel in distress. I was so touched by their kindness and the fact that they helped me when they didn't need to.

It was the most electrifying and captivating moments of the year. On the day of the game, I was trying to participate in an event that was hosted by my city. I wanted to meet one of the players on the American league's team. Yet, it can be very difficult to navigate in this section of the city. Also, it is safer and more enjoyable to experience this moment with someone else. Thus, I asked my mom to attend this event with me. Unfortunately, she was not feeling well and we could not attend.  Although I was really disappointed, I continued to look at the site to see the price for discounted tickets for the event. In the corner of my computer screen, I saw an ad for memorabilia. Initially, I was cautious but I wanted to click on it to see where it would lead. When I clicked on the ad, I was taken to the website for Major League Baseball. They were promoting free shipping on all-star game memorabilia. Since I know some baseball fanatics, I knew it would be nice to purchase one of those items. Therefore, I picked out a nice gift and sent it to one of my relatives who is a baseball fan.

Though it was no easy road and she admitted to all of us many times that she wanted to give up, she didn't. She kept pushing, sometimes missing nights of sleep and fun times to obtain a major accomplishment. She was convinced that the party was actually to celebrate the life of her stepfather, since he is old and not sure of how much time he had left to spend with his family. To her surprise, she drove an hour and a half away to be celebrated for her own accomplishments. The look on her face when she walked through the door with her cousin and heard everyone yell, ""SURPRISE!,"" was priceless. She broke down into tears of joy and was greeted by my two year old son who ran to her with open arms. She was greeted with hugs, cheers of congratulations. The program led celebration also consisted of opening and closing statements from family, friends, professors and a surprise facetime call from a classmate that was amplified on the microphone for everyone to hear. One her professors boasted about how she was the most quiet person in her class but one of the smartest.   My mother in law had her own photo backdrop with her name and school logo on it, a custom cake with her school's name, colors, mascot, and a graduation cap and degree. We also presented her with two custom made glass awards. We all ate, danced, cried, and had a good time in celebration of her achievements.

I made coffee and psyched myself up. As I came back to the site, I received more messages from the person--impatient and passive-aggressive in tone, admonishing me for taken long to reply. I apologized, and did my best to get in touch with their people and set-up the interview. I received some interruptions from my grandfather, who was going through a tough time, and I helped him as best I could, as quickly as I could, and apologized to the person. They continued to push me along in a brusque manner, but I was grateful for the opportunity. I began the interview, and for the most part, things went off without a hitch. While I could've used more occupational experience in some of the job's aspects, I was otherwise qualified. However, I noticed that the person's grammar was somewhat odd. As they claimed to be from France, it was not something that I could judge. That being said, once they seemed clueless about my specific posting, and offered more than twice the amount that I had put in for, I became extremely skeptical. As they waited for me to answer a variety of questions, I took the time to search the name of the company and my general predicament. I was met with several warnings to immediately shut down the interview and walk away: my interviewer an apparent scammer. My heart sank, and I quickly poured over every bit of information I'd shared. It was nothing more than my business e-mail and phone, but still things that I do not want bothered. I blocked the interviewer, as well as the people that had directed me to them, and kept an eye out on strange contacts from phone or e-mail. I've been lucky not to have received too much harassment, but I still feel uneasy. This has been a learning experience, and has given me a healthy skepticism in things that may seem too good to be true.",3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG86DZWK,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG86DZWK,0.0

It was our 50th reunion and Jerry was there; my first love. I introduced him to Jack but that didn't go so well. It was awkward and some intense feelings were showing. I think maybe Jerry misses me. He shouldnt've did what he did to me back in high school. He would be my husband instead, but so much for that. Molly was there and she was beautiful as ever. Even at such an old age. Beautiful white hair, curled, shoulder length; a blue polkadot dress on a surprisingly tight figure. Like Marilyn Monroe. We talked and caught up on so many things. It's a wonder why Jerry would be so enamored over me and Jack. He has such a wonderful woman by his side; and I know how faithful and dedicated Molly can be. I wonder when those two met. My best friend and first love getting together. What a marvelous and happy thought! Although, now that I think of it, they were friends back in high school. Very close actually. Sometimes I would see Molly there. One time I saw her sneaking out the door when I came for a surprise visit at Jerry's house(I did surprise visits on occasion). That's how I caught Jerry cheating on me. Now that I think of it, the slut he was with had the same figure. Oh my god! That sleaze bag of a friend!",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBGH21ZW9,0.0

They live a bit farther away, as do I, but my sister lives in Boston. Now, we are not a tight-knit family. We are usually pretty independent and like doing our own thing. However, we like to make time to get together for special occasions like this. Since my mother's birthday is also close to Mother's day in general, we decided to have a nice lunch in a relatively fancy Italian restaurant and market in Boston. We met up during Sunday afternoon. I had to run some errands and my sister was doing her own work related tasks. Now, this was the first time we had all been in the same area since the holidays, so it had been well over five months. We are not that sentimental as a family, but I could tell that my parents were really happy that we both could make it. We didn't really discuss too many emotional things, instead we strayed towards things like relatives, job talk, and diet talk. However, it never got contentious and everyone seemed like they were having a good time. I think the most memorable part of the event was just going shopping afterwords with my Mom to pick out different pastas and chocolate. I've gotten into cooking more in the past year, so I think my Mom was happy to discuss different ingredients with me. Overall, I had a good time, and it was a productive use of my day. Even though I can get self-centered, and wrapped in my own head, sometimes I do have to just step back and appreciate the things I have like my family.",3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIF7LJJ0,3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIF7LJJ0,0.0

She is involved in musical theater. She was hoping to get a lead role that would involve singing for the first time. She has had lead roles previously, but they have always been based completely on her acting and facial expressions, not singing. By the time her audition came she had improved her voice a lot and did very well. I helped her practice her songs and lines every day. She got called back for the role she wanted, along with a few other kids. She made it to the last round of the audition, but then did not get the role she was hoping for. She got yet another role that is all acting, no lines or singing. She was very upset and cried for more than an hour. I tried to help her understand that it is not because her singing is bad, it is because she has a special talent for a certain type of acting that is difficult for most people. She really just wants to sing. As the days have gone by since then, she has started to feel better. I hope that she will still have fun with the show.

This was the second time I'd been sentenced to prison time, and hopefully the last! It was a bitter experience, but my day of release was liberating - pun intended - to say the least! I was sentenced to 2 years, 9 months due to an altercation I had with a Milwaukee police officer. I was extremely inebriated during the altercation - from a consecutive days of high DXM abuse - and barely recall any of it. Having been convicted of a same or similar charge in 2013 under identical circumstances, I knew upon sobering up that prison time was guaranteed. It was an awful experience, especially in the beginning. In short, I spent 5 months between the County Jail and the House of Corrections, then a few months in an intake prison, followed by about 6 months at a medium security location, and, finally, the remainder in Racine, where I completed the Earned Release Program to save myself about 9 months of incarceration. My release was exciting, though. G and R picked me up, we went to a dollar store, then to their house to eat and relax. It was endearing and pleasant; they are great friends. This experience has taught me about friendship and integrity, and I feel as though I've become a much better - and more complete - person, as a result. The bus ride from Milwaukee to Charlotte followed; I'd been looking forward to it for over two years! Chicago was my favorite stop, of course, but the mountains in West Virginia and Tennessee are beautiful. It was a long but relaxing bus ride, and this time around I knew that I didn't need to use drugs, as I'd felt in the past. I was allowed to stay sober and to enjoy the experience for what my brain found it to be under normal circumstances.",3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A,0.0

I was 21 years old then, after that my dad brung me, my two younger brothers and two sisters were still in school. I was just going into college and was misbehaving at a lot. I just didn’t care, had very poor performance and I got excluded a lot and when I was turning 23 I got kicked out of school for good; so then all I did was sit about the house all day ‘til my friends graduates. I started drinking and smoking hash nearly every day. I pushed drugs to earn a living. Then when I got a bit older, about 24/25, I started taking ecto’s (ecstacy) and coke, only really when I was drinking and mostly at the weekends. Then one day somebody asked me and my friend if we wanted to try smack! At first we were saying no, I hated that stuff, I had seen what it had done to people. Then we both decided we would try it, just once, and never again. So we took it. We had a good few hits each and it took all our worries, all the bad stuff that had happened in our pasts, away. So we started taking it every day. One day I woke up and felt really ill. My stomach was in so much pain, I had cramps and my legs were sore when I would be sitting. I was always fidgeting, I couldn’t stay still. My bones were aching, I thought I had the flu. My nose kept running and one minute I would be cold, 2 minutes later I’d be really hot. That’s when I realised I never had the flu, I was rattling. I had £10, so I went and got a bag of smack. I started smoking it, and straight away I felt normal again. It was like I needed smack to feel normal again ‘cos I had a habit now. I started pushing drugs and coke till I got arrested for itI was in prison for 2years and turned a new leaf in there and on the day i was released my friends and family waited for me and when I say them I knew how importand friendship was and how it was a good thing to have integrity.",,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JTXQI19A,0.0

I could not keep her, unfortunately. So, after a lot of research and time, I was able to locate a rescue that was willing to take her in to a foster family. Before bringing her to the rescue, or looking for one, the real owners came forward. They were using her to breed as a puppy mill dog, basically. So, I spoke with my vet and go to get the dog in foster care anyway. I just found out a few days ago this puppy was put into a new home. I was told she is perfectly happy now. This pleases me to no end. I knew nothing good would come if the puppy was given back to the original owners. I was thrilled, and always will be, that I was able to change another creature's life for the better. I never thought I would be able to have such an impact on a creature's life. I realized after the fact that had I not intervened, she may not be here today. I was told by my vet she was not well too. I reported all of this to the rescue, and all of her health problems were detected and fixed.

I spent two weeks there with my parents and my boyfriend. First we went to France, where I was immersed in the most gloriously romantic places I have ever seen in my life. It was here that I was shocked to find that the stereotypes I had always heard about France smelling foul and the French being rude were completely incorrect. I found the French to be polite and impossibly chic. They know how to live! I don't think anybody in France works; everyone just lounges at cafes enthralled in deep conversation over a glass of wine and great food. Needless to say, we were easily able to acclimate to that way of life. Highlights of France were trying escargot in a Parisian bistro, canoeing down a river in Bordeaux, and lounging on a beach in Marseille. Next, we moved on to Italy; Or shall I say EATaly! There, we engorged on the best food that the world has to offer, like pasta, pizza, bread, gelato, and more. When we weren't shoving food in our mouths, we were gawking at the finest art that has ever been created. It was a culture overload, and it was amazing. The best parts of Italy were seeing La Traviata at an exquisite opera house in Bologna, walking through ancient architectural marvels, and sipping prosecco on the gorgeous Amalfi Coast. This trip has transformed my perspective on life. Seeing new cultures has broadened my outlook in such a way that I have tried to incorporate European habits into my life. For example, I noticed that the French were very present and engaged with each other, not like us Americans who are always on our phones. This is a valuable souvenir that I have brought home with me, and I can't wait to return and experience more!",,3PM8NZGV8Z2B3R6FNNIBPBDJB4DQXM,0.0

My wife and I were finally moving out of the apartment we shared for over 7 years and were ready to make a change. We had an extremely small place we were going to move into on some families lot just to hold us over. We planned on living there for a bit, saving a bunch of money, and doing other things like travel and a search for long term housing options in the meantime. Well, the option on the families lot fell through with less than a month to move out from our apartment. The next day, a young woman who had recently moved into our complex was having a party outside. 1 of her male friends came to visit and partake in the party. He offered my wife and I a place to park a travel trailer on his lot, for incredibly cheap and also have access to a house. This is where everything started to go downhill. My wife started to disappear, sometimes for 2 days at a time during the move out process, leaving me feeling responsible for it all. So, it's the end of April, our lease is up April 31st, and we're finally moving out after purchasing a travel trailer. We end up on the lot, it's in a very seedy neighborhood, but it's nice enough. We have full access to a home, our trailer, and now a yard. I slowly but surely start to see my wife starting to form an emotional affair right before my eyes with the male roommate. We were in a bit of a rough patch, but nothing unworkable in my eyes. She's still disappearing with him in his car, sleeping away from me, becoming extremely distant, indifferent, and all around completely out of her character. To cut the story short as it honestly is deeply upsetting me, June 2nd rolls around and as she's getting out of the shower after avoiding me like a plague, she tells me she no longer wants to try in our relationship. 8.5 years treated like a tissue that can just be thrown away. The betrayal I have felt since then has been unimaginable. Our court date is set for dissolution and my heart hurts every second of every day.",3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KQFD9CL,3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KQFD9CL,0.0

It takes a lot of time and love to do a job that you do not get paid for. We had the event about a month ago. It was a huge success and we made a lot of money for the two charities we give to. It was an emotional weekend where everyone was working all day throughout the weekend. It is very draining to be working that much through a whole weekend. When the weekend was over, everyone was so happy about what we had accomplished. We are a small group of people putting on this event for the community.

Turns out her car had been hit. She looked okay as she ran up to me at least. I asked her what had happened. She told me that she had been at the night club up the road, when this  guy started harassing her. She didn't want to deal with it anymore so she left. Well the guy who I just saw getting arrested was the guy from the club. Turns out he was following her. He signaled for her to pull over and when she refused he rammed into her car and caused a pretty bad accident. Amber was just glad to see me because she was pretty shaken up.

This is the first time where she is doing a majority of her school tasks by herself. She rides the bus, brings her own lunch, and gathers her backpack with belongings to bring home. What surprises us the most is how mature and excited she is about the entire thing! It makes us happy because my wife and I both remember dreading school in our early years. Fortunately she has been very social since preschool and is always looking forward to the next day with all of her friends and teachers. Also, unlike her parents, she is a morning person and is usually the first one awake asking to get ready to go to school. Her friends also seem to enjoy school as much as she does so that probably helps with her attitude. Just after the first week of school we are noticing improvements in several areas. She has been typically stubborn with reading every night, but she has been doing better at sounding out words. She also seems more motivated to write and practice her numbers and math. Her teachers have told us they believe she is a very smart girl, and she will very likely excel in school. We absolutely believe she will. Now just hoping she stays this interested in the years to come. Fingers crossed!",,3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NG5DEAAE,0.0

I felt completely out of place, but Grandma seemed happy. She was friends with all of the servers and other customers. It was nice to see her in her element.

I got to meet some really interesting people at the party that I had never interacted with before. Most notably was my sister in law's friend, who was full of energy.

I was adamant about there being vegetarian options, because I know a lot of people who might attend were vegetarian. Sometimes you go to parties with food and it's all meat, or just really boring stuff. But this caterer was particularly fancy, and we got a great deal because the lady who owns the business is a friend of mine. I overheard a lot of people talking about how great the food was.

She lives a couple of states away and I hadn't seen her in many years. Last October grandpa died and by his request he was cremated and had a memorial in the spring. We didn't get to go because we couldn't get time off work. While we were up there though we went to his grave site, which is in a veterans memorial cemetery. It's a nice place and looks well taken care of.  I was nervous about seeing grandma for the first time in over a decade. I just never got the chance to go up there. My parents took a couple of trips but I couldn't get off work and stayed behind to watch the house and dogs. Anyway I was worried that I wouldn't remember much about her or the house but it all came back to me when I got there. They have a basement with loads of neat stuff. Grandma still does a lot of craft type things. It turned out she remembered less of me being there and didn't think I had been there for an even longer time. We went to see her brother and had a formal dinner which I was not prepared for. I was under dressed and felt out of place, which was a little awkward. But they were nice and it was a decent time.",3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NGXPOAA4,3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NGXPOAA4,0.0

He is an incredibly good player, good student, and is well-liked.  However, some kids have taken affront to the fact that he is an all around good kid and good guy.  They are jealous of his popularity and his alleged perfection.   Before practice 4 kids circled him up and pushed him around while taunting him with emotionally scarring words that effected his game play during practice.  He didn't want to turn the kids in because he felt that that would cause more problems, but he did choose to share his concerns with me -as a way to vent.  He and I went for a long run to get it out of our systems.   I couldn't sleep that night, I was angry at the kids and upset for my son.  Even though he said he was ok, I knew that he wasn't and I could see the hurt and frustration in his eyes.  The next day, I called the coach and took it upon myself to report the situation.  He was surprised because everyone likes my son, and was concerned that he opted not to say anything to him about it.  The coach wound up looking at the security footage from the field for that day, and though he couldn't hear what was being said, he was able to determine who it was, and what was happening.  He showed the whole team the footage at practice the next day.   The entire team -except those kids of course - voted to have the brats kicked off the team for bullying and harassment.  They were also suspended from school for their behavior.  I know it was wrong, but I couldn't help but feel a little pleasure in the how this was handled.",3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIUP6II3,0.0

How I'm always thinking about food to the point where I can't concentrate. How I feel so guilty after eating. She listened to me and asked me some questions, then pulled up a little questionnaire. There were some questions about my feelings about food. There were also some about how often I binge-eat. I was embarrassed to answer those ones. I felt humiliated when she read my answers. I didn't want to talk about it, but I knew I needed to. After reading all of my answers, she said she had a new diagnoses for me. Binge eating disorder.

It was a mad scramble with the family and I knew more than anybody that you was ready for her last days.  We assembled as a team and took shifts to be with her.  She was there probably about 14 days in a row by now.  The nurses that were coming in and out of the room had this look on their face like they knew what was about to happen.  The background was very serene and quiet and there was momentos of the family all over the place - family pictures, fresh flowers, trinkets.  My grandmother was laying there quietly.  She was laying on her side and had her eyes closed but she was still breathing. The blankets were laying on top of her.  Her hands were cold and turning dark.  The last few times I tried to talk to her, she could barely open her eyes but I knew she was there.  She had spoken of you times and I was always sitting by her side just waiting for her to say something to me.  She was extremely drugged and incoherent and barely able to speak.  I leaned over to brush her hair aside, and I whispered in her ear ""Grandma, I'm here.  We're not going to leave you""  I touched her hand and she closed her fingers around mine.  She opened her eyes barely and said these words to me ""Don't worry I'll see you again"" As I began to cry, she took a last gasp and passed away.

I run a small business fro home baking cakes, cookies, cupcakes and the like, until this all of my orders had been relatively small orders. It was for a dear friends brother's wedding, it was a large three tier cake, and I was nervous but I felt like I should take it on. The cake design its self was one that was difficult, square, which is difficult for me because in needs crisp edges, covered in handmade flowers, and wrapped in a black ribbon. The act of getting it to the wedding venue its self was gong to be stressful because it had to be transported in the heat of the summer in the south. I also felt that their wedding was a little unorganized but I felt that they were a great couple to do my first wedding cake fo rdue to the fact that they were laid back and very understanding people. I was so nervous, I started working as far ahead as I could and researched the best ways to transport and stack the cake. The day before I prepared the cake and had everything ready, and my nerves were a wreck. My husband and I laid down to go to bed, at three in the morning we got a phone call. My father in lay had a heart attack and was in critical conditions, my husband rushed to get his things together and make the drive 2 states away. So now I had to figure out how to pack me and 2 children and my husband enough stuff to last however long we might need to be there and deliver a wedding cake with 2 small children in tow. I was now officially a nervous wreck, I called the lady who was planning the wedding, and told her I needed to deliver the cake as early as I could, I packed all of our clothes, and the cake in the car with my 2 and 6 year old and headed towards the church. I managed to set up the cake and prepare it for the bride in 20 minutes and head towards my father in law. I had to leave the church before the bride was even able to come see the cake. I then drove 4 hours with two little kids to meet my husband. Thankful my father in law is on the mend but that was an extremely stressful day. The bride ended up being very happy with the cake as well and the wedding has gotten me several other orders.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFPWF12B,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFPWF12B,0.0

In the evening, My son called me and told me he is sending a big amount of money to me for the celebration. I was happy and that was a great relief to me. After some times I receive credit notification, that was from my son. I called him to appreciate him. Bout Five minute later, another credit notification, this time, it was my friends. I was not expecting that much from them. At first, don't know all the details about the money, it was when one of the called me that he explained everything to me. I was speechless but extremely happy. At this moment, I have more than enough to spend for the anniversary. The following day, we got all we needed and make all the necessary preparations.

Some of the highlights included eating a couple nice meals at a steak house and an Italian place. We hung out at the Wynn's pool for one day. That was pretty cool. I don't frequent the Wynn much, as I am pretty loyal to Caesar's properties, since I have status with them, and they give me free rooms. However, I will have to go to the Wynn more. Especially, since their poker room is good, and I play poker for a good portion of my income. We watched a lot of the games at Venetian, since they have a pretty good sports book. I didn't bet on the games as much as I usually do, though we all did put some money on random games here and there. I kind of felt bad because I was a bit over served at times (alcohol wise). Though, tbh, we all may have been at times. The time went really fast. It was great getting to see him away from our family, since those are usually the only times I see him. Him and his friends are also corporate guys, so I'm sure it was great for all of them. I think they do it every year. Hopefully, I'll take a similar trip in the future. It was nice seeing family in Vegas. I am always with friends or women that I am hooking up with, so this was a nice change of pace.",3PXX5PX6LYKC38WXTVT7AE7MECVBAV,,0.0

I was very proud though and pleased with the gift. It helps relieve some of the student debt I incurred. My wife also returned to school around the same time I did.

I've known him since middle school and we have always been very close. He has supported me through many dark times in my life and has always been a source of positive energy. He has had to deal with a series of unfortunate events recently such as his father suddenly passing away and breaking up with his girlfriend of 4 years. About a month ago he called me in the middle of the night and told me that he was planning on taking his own life. When I arrived at his place he was just sitting in the dark in his living room with a pistol on the table. It really surprised me because my friend had never touched a gun before in his life. It was heartbreaking to see someone who has done so much for me in so much pain, knowing that there was little I could do to fix the situation. There were times during that evening where I felt helpless and that nothing I was saying was making it through to him. I even got upset myself because I felt that he wasn't willing to listen to me despite our relationship and decades of friendship. That was a very taxing evening and there were moments where our friendship felt extremely strained but I knew I couldn't just abandon him when he was at his lowest. I spent the entire night trying to talk him out of it and eventually succeeded but knew that I had to do more. The next day I convinced him to look into therapy and even considered having him temporarily committed to protect him from harming himself but ultimately decided that something like that would probably ruin our friendship for good, despite it being done with the best intentions. Fortunately my friend responded to therapy and medication very well and has made a lot of progress dealing with his mental issues.

However, after much consideration, I decided to stay. About three months ago, my direct manager reprimanded me in front of my entire office for something very petty. The incident led me to seriously consider leaving again, as she does have a habit of doing this to my team. I spoke about leaving my job with my husband for a month, I started my resignation letter, I started to look for other part time work, and created a pro/con list of why I should stay or leave. After weeks of tears, I finally decided to announce that I will be leaving. It took my manager by surprise. I was heartbroken because I love my job and the people I serve on a day to day basis. My manager asked me to stay for one more quarter, and as I continue working, day by day, I keep getting affirmations on my decision. I also wanted to leave on good terms, and continue to serve my Members well. In the last few weeks, I've received many compliments and awards at work. I was even recognized with a Challenge Coin from the local Police Department because I prevented someone from getting scammed. I also kept reading articles that reminded me it's OK to temporarily leave the work force. My Mother, however, was not very supportive. She called me weak for wanting to leave and be a stay at home parent. My Mother-in-Law is excited for me and is happy that I'll be able to spend more time serving my family.",,3PZDLQMM0U768ATZUGWNFGU6TSUC2Y,0.0

The night that he died, I was at work, and had I realized he was going to pass so soon I would have gone to the hospital to see him. I had seen him earlier in the week multiple times; he had varying states of lucidity, as he was in a lot of pain. However, we did get to communicate a fair amount. He knew I was there, and he knew that I loved him. But I work kind of a weird schedule, and I had to leave. It was hard to see him suffer. He had always been a very healthy person, even through his five-year battle with lung cancer. However, his health had declined rapidly, and he now had pneumonia. The most memorable event, sad to say, was likely when I received the text message from my mother telling me that he had passed. She had tried calling, but my phone was charging elsewhere. Once, a great-uncle had died and I found out on Facebook before anyone told me. I was very hurt by that, and she had tried to avoid something like that since. But she texted my brother and I as she couldn't get ahold of us by phone. I was at work, and I went to my desk and cried for a bit. Then I talked to my boss and asked for the next few days off as bereavement leave. I really did not expect him to go that soon, and I was so sad that I couldn't be there to say goodbye.",,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRER8BB15Q,0.0

My brother recenly came to visit and it was an odd dynamic for him to visit and stay with our mother while I am a permanent resident of her place. It felt a little ackward. He is coming from out of state where he is happily living his life and visiting me, who felt like he needed to move in with our mother for her sake. He never said anything derogatory or tried to make me feel bad for living with her, but I felt it anyway. I know it was all in my head, but I just kind of felt like the loser that is living with mom. He stayed for a long weekend. We would hang our around the house and go out to eat a lot. We would watch movies at home and play Scrabble. He fixed a few things around the house, because he is good at that sort of thing. The visit was fun and it was good to see him, it just reminded me of the status of my life and how I am sort of tied down to my mother. It is all my choosing and I think my brother is glad I am here, but I still feel jealous of his freedom and that's probably where a lot of the negativity that I feel stems from. Even though I had the negative feelings while he was out here, I just pushed those to the side when he was here and acted like all was well. I love my brother and his coming out meant a lot to both my mother and myself. I know he will always be there for me when I need him, but right now I am concentrating on being there for my mother.",3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRERBUQ51E,,0.0

I was trying to find work but I just never could. I had to start living on savings. I lived on saving for about 3 months. Still unable to find more than a few odd jobs, I could no longer pay my rent. Because of this my landlord started an eviction process. Unfortunately this turned into a fiasco that I'll never forget. He went completely insane. My landlord started beating on my door threatening to kick it down and to attack me physically. This was way outside of the normal legal process of eviction. We eventually had an altercation and I had to call the police on him. They arrested him and I continued to live in the residence until he got out of jail about a month later. After he got out he started the formal eviction process. By that time luckily I had found work and just decided to leave ASAP and find another place to live.

It was such a long journey, but really this is just the beginning.  After my husband moved to America and we went through that whole ordeal of getting his green card I knew it what it would be like getting my visa, I'm glad that's finally over.  Eleven long months of applications and waiting to finally get my visa, but it was worth the wait.  I can't believe that we're actually moving to Australia.  I know it seems weird that my husband would move to America, just for us to both move over to Australia a year later.  Honestly it just seems like the whole situation will be better once we get over there as long as we don't get burned up by the fires, lol.  We began shopping for houses a few weeks ago when we felt like my visa would be approved, but we're still not quite sure where we're going to move to exactly.  I think somewhere along the east coast, because I'm pretty sure there's not much else west of that.  Speaking of learning I might need to get a book or something.  I don't even know what kind of money they use, and I just realized I'll have to learn to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road.  This whole move seems like a daunting task but I know it'll be worth it.  Even the kids are excited to go.  They think they'll get to have a crocodile as a pet!

I looked at my phone and saw on my calendar that today was the big day I had been waiting for, after the past 4 years of responsible studying and grueling all night cram sessions. I was to receive my diploma, my B.A. in Computer Science, officially today on stage. I quickly got up, took a shower, brushed my teeth, got dressed and skipped to the kitchen to have breakfast. I lived alone, with just my dog, in a small apartment. So we enjoyed a lovely and quiet breakfast together. I later went for a walk with my best friend around the block, it helped to calm my nerves and expel the butterflies in my stomach, as well as calm down my furry friend. After our morning routine, I arranged my gown and cap, made sure to press them down, wrinkle free, and folded and packed them neatly to wear for later. I got in my car and drove to the graduation ceremony location, a large auditorium on campus that was usually reserved for putting on plays and concerts. I greeted my two best friends, Jared and Jake, and my scarce family there as well ; at the school. My family and I were a smaller than average bunch, with me being an only child and my father passing away at a early age, it was only my mom and my uncle there to cheer me on. I gave them both great big hugs and we took some pictures together with great big smiles. I left to get dressed up and ready for the ceremony. After getting dressed, we took our seats next everyone else in the large auditorium. The usual mandatory, long winded speeches were given, with our special guest speaker a famous vocalist who I cannot recall the name of, someone from American Idol I think. When the time finally came for us to walk up one by one to receive our diploma, I was a bit nervous and weary, as everyone before me had received such large applause and cheer from the crowd. With only two of my family members attending, I thought it might be a bit embarrassing to not have any sort of uproarious applause for my name being called. I got in line, and slowly proceeded to walk on stage, with our names being alphabetically announced, I was soon to be next. When my name was heard over the speakers, I was quite surprised and excited. What I thought would be a few claps, turned out to be an enthusiastic and encouraging applause of a multitude of people. I was humbled by the support and it gave me the confidence boost I needed to stride on stage and shake hands with my teachers with pride. I couldn't remove the large smile on my face for that entire day because of how nice everyone was to me and because of this moment, I will never forget the sense of exhilarated bliss that I experienced from not only the culmination of my 4 years of hard work, but the positive support of strangers, friends and family.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6S2C5P,0.0

My boss had given us 7 days off due to low level of work load to everyone. I decided that I would travel by road and spend sometime with my family. I had been visiting them after an year almost after I had moved out to a different city. When I entered my home, I could not describe the feeling it gave me. The smell of my home is truly unique. I found my mother working in the kitchen, cooking the lunch and expecting me. I hugged her, and went to my room to unload. This time I had money in my pocket and as I laid down on my bed, I realized that how lucky I am. I have a good job, and loving parents. I realized that not many people in this world are truly blessed like that. We could always complain about the luxuries we do not have in life, but at the end of the day, you do not need them anyway because they give just temporary pleasures. I called up my friends in the town to meet-up. We all sat down on the weekend and caught by the latest events happening with everyone of us. There is a lot of joy in little things, and sometimes we should take some time out to appreciate those little things.",,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6S2C5P,0.0

Finally at 12:15 am, he made his arrival. My mother and sister came over just in time to meet him, straight from my brother's wedding reception.

I was still trying to figure out what college was the best for me but also still affordable.  I had my heart set on this college from Sophomore year, with the cost that far exceeded what my family could afford.  I had applied to many other colleges; I was awaiting final offers to see what I would get.  One day, I received a financial aid letter from another school, which was just as prestigious as the first college I had my heart set on.  I saw that letter and was amazed at the level of generosity of the financial aid department, but I needed more to be able to attend.  I had been sending financial aid appeal letters out to every college that sent me a financial aid offer as to try and get the best offer, I could get. What comes next is what made me realize why this school was in fact the right choice for me.  I sent a letter in asking for them to give me extra consideration for aid based upon my special circumstances.  I then less than a week later received an email informing me that my aid package had been finalized.  I was awarded an additional $4,000, giving me a full ride to the school.  When I heard this, my Mom and I cried for we had finally figured out a college that would work for me.  For a low-income hard-working student, that was the saving grace I needed to realize that they were the one for me.  The other school responded much worse refusing to offer me anymore money and refusing to help make their program affordable for me.  They took almost two months to respond.  What this made me realize is that the school that was generous would eb the school that I would want to attend for the next four years.  When I needed help, they would be able to help me and ensure that I made it through.  After realizing this, I immediately committed and paid my deposit and now am going to be attending that school in the fall.",3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5DU320C,3QAPZX2QN5ZMEIYJI033KFS5DU320C,0.0

It was filled with high highs, and low lows. Even though summer only ended 2 months ago I feel like it has been weeks and years since I was out in nature enjoying the beautiful weather and wind blowing on my face. One of my fondest memories this past summer was something that I saw outside my window. I peeked out of the kitchen window and looked out to see a rainbow in the sky. After enjoying the rainbow for some time I noticed there was a nest build on my window sill. I cannot believe I almost missed this beautiful sight. The mother bird was a rare shade of pink I have never seen before in nature only in the zoo. But the most majestic part of this experience was the eggs that laid peacefully still in the nest. The eggs were the bluest shade of blue I had ever seen before. I never pictured that a pink bird could lay such beautiful blue eggs. The mother bird was always so attentive to the nest and watchful over these eggs. Just before I left for holiday I saw an egg begin to crack. I unfortunately never got to see the birds hatch. I only wish I could have been there to see their birth and watch them fly off into the world. This was such a rare memorable experience I doubt I will ever get to see again.",,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RA9RALP,0.0

As I saw the beautiful dresses. All I could think was how beautiful my bride would look and how I wouldn’t want it to be anyone other than I person I was sitting next to. As I thought about it, listened to the music that surrounded the room. I watched the parties walk down the aisle I couldn’t help but be overcome with emotion. I was moments from crying, crying tears that were nothing but the happiest of tears. I continued to think about our future together and how a wedding and a ceremony to celebrate our love was only the beginning of our life together. It was only the start and there would be so much more to look forward to. We are expected to be somewhat emotional at weddings, this was a close friend of ours to be exact so it was to be expected. We knew the struggles the couple had faced so it was even more suitable to be emotional in this moment. However, what my future fiance did not know was the real reason I was so emotional, the real reason behind my happy tears. This would be something she would find out later in our relationship and something she would come to love. The more we began to know each other and the more I told her about those moments that made me fall in love with her, the more she fell in love with me. Those moments that I have to myself are so special to myself.

I woke up and thought that not much would be different but I didn't realize how wrong I was. That day, my life would change forever, it was the day I decided to spend the rest of my life with the woman of my dreams. Months earlier we were invited to attend the wedding of good friends of ours. I knew the venue and where the wedding was to take place, I knew the people and frankly I didn't expect many surprises but from the minute I arrived I was proved wrong. As I sat down in the crowd at the reception area and the party began to walk down the aisle I felt tears rolling down my face. I couldn't contain the feelings of joy as the beautiful ceremony began. The music, the flowers, the dresses and suits, it was all just perfect. I remember vividly as the music began and the bride began to walk down the isle I thought about all the hardship they had endured and how happy this couple was to be together and how lucky I was to be spending this day with them. It was at this moment that I looked over at my, now fiancee, and began to think about how she was the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. She was the one that I wanted to share a day like this with. She was the one I wanted others to look at as she walked down the aisle to meet me and feel overjoyed with emotions. I don't enjoy making people cry but in this case I think it is warranted. The very next day I went out looking for an engagement ring, I scoured everywhere I could and went looking for the perfect ring. When I finally found it I knew it was meant to be and I could not be happier to give it to her. Fast forward a little bit of time and we are as happy as could be, planning our special day. In my head I keep that special day in the back of my mind, the day I knew I wanted to share the rest of my life with my significant other. It may have started like any other day but it will never be that for me. It may another day or just another wedding to others but it will always be much more for me. And I'll always know the reasons why.",3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RYWXALT,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RYWXALT,0.0

We were invited there as our friends has reserved a beach house and a few rooms were going to be empty anyways. It was a lot of fun to be at the beach. It's memorable for a few reasons. The first is that I got to see my oldest child build up the courage to get into the ocean for the first time. She was very pensive at first and was crying. I was able to sit down next to her and tell her that it was safe and there was nothing to be afraid of. Eventually she was able to fight her fears, with the help of her mom and our friend, and get into the water. It made me feel very proud to see her build up the courage to get in the water. Another reason is that my youngest daughter was able to nap on the beach for a few hours. She is normally a crazy kid with boundless energy, so it was very surprising to see her calm down and sleep that way. It gave me a lot of happiness to see how much fun my kids had and how well they got along with the other kids that were present. The reason that this event will be significant for me is that it was one of the first vacations that we have had as a family. It was also mostly positive and mostly stress free. It was something that I hope to do more of in the future.",,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM0U1T5Q,0.0

I was in my bedroom when I heard a loud popping noise at about 4 in the morning. I jumped out of bed and ran into the living room to see what the noise was, and, seeing nothing, returned to my bedroom to discover that the noise had been something exploding next to my bed and my room was on fire. Both my laptop and phone were plugged in next to my bed, and it's unclear which one overheated and caused the fire, but by the time I noticed the fire had started there was no time to put it out. I woke up my family and we grabbed our pets and ran outside. We called the fire department, but our house is located in the middle of the woods in a very rural area, so it took them an hour to find us. We actually walked to the end of the end of the driveway and tried to flag them down as they drove up and down the road looking for our address, but it took them a while to see us. When they finally got back to our house, most of it had burned. My room, my brothers room, the hallway, the kitchen, my mom's room, the living room, and the bathroom were mostly destroyed. The parts of the house that hadn't burned were destroyed by water damage from putting the fire out. Everyone else in my family was able to sift through the rubble the next day to find that, although their walls, floors, and clothes were ruined, a lot of their possessions remained in tact. Because the fire had started in my room, however, every single thing I owned was burned to ash. This was an emotional, frightening, and stressful event; however, it was not as sad or discouraging as most people would think. Two weeks before my house burned down, my friends' house also burned, only her dad got trapped inside and died. Even though I lost all my material things, I could only look at my family and be grateful that everyone made it out alive, even our pets!",3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4,0.0

Except one thing. My husband, being the sweetheart that he is, decided to treat me to a spa day at the resort's spa. I was so excited, I had never had a hot stone massage before and was really looking forward to the experience. They always look so relaxing on the commercials and TV shows. Unfortunately the guy giving me the massage was just so...creepy. There's no other way to describe it he was just a creep. Constant comments on how great my body is and how he loves my long hair. Not to mention that I'm pretty sure there wasn't supposed to be rock repeatedly balanced on my butt (they never show that in commercials anyway). I wanted to speak up so badly but there's a large man standing over me with rocks in his hands, this doesn't exactly put me in a safe position. So I just layed there waiting for the whole mess to be over with. Safe to say this is the least relaxing massage I have ever gotten. I haven't told my husband yet, I don't want him to feel bad or get angry at the massage therapist or other hotel staff and do something stupid. Either way it's probably been too long now. I hope someone else deals with it and reports him.",,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B5T5U,0.0

I Googled the weather before we went because I was really worried about rain, I know it is summer but you just never know. Thankfully the weather forecast for the whole week was bright sunshine. We packed a lot of sunscreen, I needed a new bathing suit so went shopping the week before and found the perfect one, I don't usually go to the beach. The kids got new books to keep them busy on the drive there and I swear I repacked at least seven times. We took a lot of games to play because the kids get bored easily and we wanted to make it a tech free vacation so we knew we needed to keep them busy! We ended up playing a lot of games on the trip, especially poker, who knew it was so much fun! I think the highlight of the trip for me was collecting seashells, we wanted to get enough to make some jewelry when we got home, my youngest kid was so excited about this and spent hours searching for the perfect shells. It is actually crazy how many washed up on the shore, we really enjoyed walking along the beach and it was so peaceful. I was surprised to see so few other people, I mean it was June, you would think there would be people everywhere. We saw maybe 10 people the whole time. It was so relaxing and we would sit in the hot tub in the evening and just remove stress from daily life. The kids want to go back soon and even my husband who is more of an inside type person is asking to go back! I think it is probably one of the best vacations we have ever had. And the best part is nobody got sunburn! I think the only thing I would change is the hotel we stayed in, it was rated as four star but it was not great and overpriced. I will have to research better for next year now we know we love the location.",,3QEMNNSB2YLNZ3WJ0O8TVDTWPAT7DE,0.0

On her end she doesn't really have the time to due to work. about 5 months ago we made the change to travel more. we had discussed places we'd like to go and vegas was one. So we chose to visit las vegas first. This would be first time traveling with the wife to las vegas. we had to catch a plane to vegas because driving would have cost about the same. So we decided that it would just be easier to fly. once we had got there we checked into our rooms gotten a litte confortable and then went to dinner. The same night we had to see the attractions and lights as well as the desert landscape. It was pretty dry in the air due to the desert. That type of landscape is unfamiliar to us as we are from a tropical island. So we had to adjust to the different climates.

We had gone down to Fremont and it was 9:30pm we decided to eat at the buffet.  It was seafood night and we did not realize we spent 2 hours eating.  The weed was also another great thing to have.

It was a cool summer afternoon and it had just finished raining. We decided to pack up our things and take a spontaneous trip to the most remote part of Park. Once we arrived, we set our things down and set up camp. We unpacked the marshmallows and started up a fire. We sat around the fire and just talked. Talked about our childhood, jobs, girlfriends, sports, you name it. We talked away the afternoon and our nostalgic memories lit up our faces. Our past few years hadn't been easy, with Dad leaving us and mom being stressed out raising us alone. This was our chance to just forget about hardships and focus on our love. Finally we got up and hiked up the mountain before nightfall. Once we reached the apex, we were greeted by the most majestic view of the valley. The forest canopy glistened under the soft glow of the moonlight as far as the eye could. We gasped in delight. Finally it was time to go back. I wish we couldve stayed in that moment forever.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C71844FO,0.0

We had never discussed the idea prior. We were almost 3,000 miles from home, visiting San Francisco, California to see the final Warped Tour and our favorite band together. It was something we had been planning for quite some time, and we were both very excited about it. The morning he proposed he told me he had the whole day planned out and to dress cute because he could take pictures to send home. He took me to the Japanese Tea Garden, which is a place I had wanted to see for quite some time. We spent about an hour walking around the garden and just seeing the sights, and he seemed a little nervous the entire time. Honestly I just thought maybe he was still a little tied from the flight. They had a table ready for us next to the water and he ordered my favorite tea and some small snacks. We talked for a little bit and took some silly pictures by the water. Everyone there already knew it was about to happen, he had called over 2 months ago to make sure everything was ready and that he was going to be able to pull it off. They were ready to take pictures and capture the moment for us. It was beautiful and so well planned out. He really made it a memorable event for me and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. I couldn't have planned it better myself.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7B62F43,0.0

We asked his best friend if he wanted to come, and he said yes. Then we asked my younger brother, since he had been wanting to go for awhile but didn't want to go by himself. It was a little over an hour drive, so we left early in the morning so that we could get there right when the park opened. we stopped at a fast food place to get breakfast that we could eat on the way. we ended up getting lost because the gps on my phone was confusing, but it only took an extra ten minutes to fix. once we got there, we decided not to pay for parking, so we parked further away and walked to the park. luckily it was all downhill. when we got to the entrance, we wasted about 10 minutes in the wrong line because it was busy and we got confused. once we got in, we went to the bathrooms and then decided where we wanted to go. i tried to be fair and make sure that we took turns deciding on what to do, so that everyone was able to do something they liked. we went on multiple water rides, and i waited outside roller coasters with the bags while the others went on them. we got rained out kind of early, so we went on an indoor ride to wait out the rain. it was super fun. we also went on a kiddie water ride; i guess our boat was too heavy because we ended up getting stuck in the middle of the ride and had to push ourselves out. it was hilarious, though. we left about 30 minutes before the park closed; walking uphill to the car was not fun for my asthma and i had chest pains most of the ride home. we also took a different road, so we ended up driving through downtown pittsburgh, which was somewhat stressful for my husband. we had to pee, so we stopped at this gas station once on the interstate, and i kid you not the bathroom was disgusting. i felt like i could get diseases from it, and i've used alot of dirty bathrooms. it was creepy. but all in all, it was a fun day.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXGEMLB3,,0.0

I decided I wanted to adopt a companion dog. I found Buddy , a sweet a cute Border terrier in the animal shelter.    I fell in love with him even before we got home.   My life changed, just like I hoped it would.  I was never lonely, I was more active when I walked him.  He liked children when the kids and got along with other dogs. Best of all he loved to snuggle in the chair with me.  I was happy and content. One early evening, we went out for a walk and we encountered a dog that Buddy knew.  Buddy immediately went after him, growling, canines showing, very vicious.  It really surprised me.  About halfway through the walk, Buddy did the did the same thing with another dog.    I just couldn't understand it..The worst was yet to come.  We got home to the apartment and a group of kids was petting a dog.  I veered to go around them, but Buddy broke through to get to the dog.  In the process, he bit one of the children.  My heart broke right then and there.  He had to be returned to the shelter.  It has been two months, and I still tear up thinking about Buddy.  I miss him terribly.  Why did he change so much?  Buddy was the best of times and the worst of times.  And I am still grieving.",,3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXJX8BLK,0.0

Then I talked to my brother on the phone and next think I know I was talking weird. My blood pressure spiked I was having a panic attack. My fiance rushed home to find me on the floor. She wanted me to go to the hospital but I could not do it. I pleaded with her not to go just let me lay. I did lay down and was able to calm myself. I scheduled a doctors appt to get some medicine to help me cope. I know am finally learning to be at peace with it and putting more time into my relationship with my 4 year old son. My mothers passing is behind me and I can move on. May she rest in peace with my father.,3QILPRALQ6H0LTSFZNE25I1LGLVN85,,0.0

He said he would be with some of the other participants, so at first it might be kind of lame, what with a bunch of people talking shop.  But, I always had a good time around Rick, so I was sure he would make it fun.    I got to the hotel just before  eight-thirty and left my car with the valet.  I was directed to the restaurant and one I got there, I spotted Rick and all of his colleagues.  There was four of them and they looked like they had gotten comfortable already.  I greeted Rick warmly and he introduced me to everybody.  We were all about the same age and, as I was surprised to see, we all had similar backgrounds.   I also was surprised that none of them wanted to talk shop.  They were there to have fun and get away from their jobs for a while; which is surprising these days.   Despite two women being in the group we talked about Formula One racing, mixed martial arts, how the Dolphins suck.  The conversation even got pretty raunchy, times.  Which I think all guys agree is kind of risky in the #metoo era.  We ate a lot (Asian fusion) and we drank a lot.  I actually drank a little too much and was worrying about the drive home.   The parry lasted for about two hours and when we were done, I was a little shaky.  Rick insisted that I stay in his room for the night because he had a double bed.  I took him up on the offer and after we said good night to the others, instead of going back to the room, we actually went of over to the bar and and had a few more drinks.  Rick and I had not spent too much time together since college; most of our contact had been through texts and social media.  But, it didn't take us long to fall into old habits.  Just like in the old days, one drink led to another.  By the time the bar was closing, both of us were shit faced.  A hotel employee had to help us up to the room.  After the doors closed behind us, I pretty much draw a blank as to what occurred after that.",,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED1DDN14,0.0

It was a friend of a friend of my husband's so we aren't super close but we've gotten closer over time. I felt very nervous about going because I often feel like the third wheel in such situations. Everyone has a history while I'm the new girl. When we got there, there was a lot of people. The decorations were nice and the food smelled great. I greeted the parents to be. I saw a few others knew (also friends of friends) and sat with them for most of the time. I ended up having a much better time than I had initially anticipated. We chilled out on the rooftop deck of the building. The weather was great. I felt very relaxed and not on edge like I had been the days before. I found out a guy there was from the same hometown as mine. He and his wife had two kids who were the same age as ours. We exchanged info for future play dates. After the shower, my husband, two friends, and I walked to the pier for more fun. It turned out to be a pretty great day.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87BYAEMB,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87BYAEMB,0.0

He had worked so hard in his AP classes and made his entire middle school time look effortless. I sat in the auditorium with my husband and watched him walk across that stage in his green gown. He looked so tall and strong. it was crazy to think that just 15 years ago he was small enough to sit on my lap and now he is closer to his adult life than he is to being a baby. I don't know what he will end up doing but I am sure whatever he does he will be successful at it. I remember watching him at the ceremony and thinking of his first day of kindergarten.  He seemed so little but brave. My husband was sitting next to me and as we held hands I thought about how special our family was and how lucky I was to be a part of this life. There was a slide show at the end of the performance and we were all surprised that the teacher who had made it had gone back through past school years and found pictures of the kids from kindergarten through 8th grade. I was shocking to see how grown up they all looked now. Some of the kids were unrecognizable. Some of the kids look like they hadn't changed a bit, just growing taller. It was wonderful to look at all of the friends groups throughout the years and see that almost all of them were still in tact. I thought about what it will be like for all of them in the future.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87CL5MEP,3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87CL5MEP,0.0

The job seemed like a really good job, and so I started to work for him. We are still friends to this day, and I still work with him. The job is really good and pays very well.

I went on a trip with my youngest son to NYC.  It was our first trip together, just the two of us. It was the first time either of us have ever been to NYC.  It was amazing.  The sights, the sounds, the energy of the city!  We visited the Statue of Liberty, the 911 Memorial, Central Park, and so many more places.  We stayed out late and slept in late. My son's favorite place was Times Square.  He loved the bright lights and the people.  I enjoyed seeing all the places.  I don't think I could pick a favorite.  I loved the history behind the Statue of Liberty.  The 911 Memorial was sobering and left us quiet and contemplative.  Central Park was a fantastic dose of nature in the middle of the large city.  China Town and Little Italy were so exciting and different for us.  The most memorable thing for me happened on the last day.  We were walking towards the subway to head back to the airport.  My son turned to me and said ""Mom this was an amazing trip.  I had so much fun with you.  Thanks.""",3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NQCNU,,0.0

It was a rare time that I actually got out by myself. As a mother to a toddler, he's nearly always at my side. A little solitude was nice. I was walking through the aisles when I heard a baby crying. I thought, well that sounds familiar. The cries continued as a kept shopping. I finally came down the aisle where the cries originated from and saw a frazzled mother with a newborn baby, holding back tears while dodging dirty looks from passing customers. I've been there plenty of times before, and no matter how many times it happens, it's always nerve wracking. I approached the woman and told her sympathetically that I'm a mom too, and I get it. And if she needs some help, I would be happy to assist. I could tell she was unsure but also desperate for some assistance. I asked what I could help with. She said if I could hold her baby while she finished looking for all the ingredients she needed, it would be a big help. So that's what I did. I followed behind her, holding and rocking her baby to sleep while she was able to concentrate on her shopping. When she was done, she hugged me and thanked me. Even though it was a rare child-free outing for me, I still felt good about having one in my arms.",3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X4VM6NCA,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X4VM6NCA,0.0

It was my friend Jessica's birthday and we all went and did karaoke.  I drove to the event, which was incredibly stupid because I knew I was going to be drinking and when I drink I also drink too much.  The karaoke place was about two miles from my house.  Over the course of the evening I proceeded to get drunker and drunker as did everyone else. I dont think we even had a DD or someone who was just drinking a little bit. When the end of the night came, which had been a lot of fun, we all kind of staggered out to the parking lot. I initially got in my car deciding I would drive home, but I suddenly couldn't even remember where I was in the city. Like, I could not think of which direction to drive in to get to my house. I finally got my phone out and kind of fought with it for probably 15 minutes until I finally was able to update my credit card information in the Uber app and contacted a driver. When I got home it was probably 2:30 in the morning and I immediately passed out.  When I came to around 7:30 I looked at my phone and had dozens of missed calls and missed messages on my phone and in my group message.  It turns out one of my friend's had gotten caught up at a DUI checkpoint and was calling from jail asking for assistance.  He was calling to know if he should take a breathalyzer or just deny it and wanted us to research what to do online. I missed all the frantic messages from my friends though, which I would have been worthless anyway in that situation because I was so out of it. He also wanted us to come bail him out but our jail must be too overcrowded because they didn't hold him and just released him at around 9 in the morning, even though he was still legally drunk, I""m sure. We did have to take him to get his car from an impound lot.  The whole experience was terrible, but I also felt relief for myself.",,3QRYMNZ7FZ3JJDK32LPXWEX8K2ZTNH,0.0

Cliche as it sounds and as over dramatic as I may come off as, I'd have to say it meant the world to me to finally meet somebody with a head on their shoulders and who isn't a completely horrible person. Well, let me clarify that not everyone is that, but my prior relationships in both instances were enough to turn me off of the very thought of another for a lifetime. Between mental abuse, lies, manipulation and cheating, I somehow managed to hit the jackpot back to back, in the worst of ways. I won't go into details about that, simply to save everyone the displeasure of a history lesson and a guy who couldn't see similar signs from two different people, but instead finally go into details about this next one. Through a neutral friend we ended up meeting one another and neither really had any wants or desires for a relationship. We started out as friends, we'd bullshit around and usually did things with the group. Although we both had some unique, silly tastes that the entire group hadn't enjoyed (But parts did). Anyways, as time passed and we continued to learn from one another that we enjoyed quite a bit together, we decided to do more things on a one on one basis, without so many people around. Recently though this came to a head as we finally realized what we were doing and came to talk about it. She was a veteran, with obvious problems from her time serving, along with a horrible ex-husband and failures afterwards. Obviously what she endured had been worse than mine, but it's ultimately not a competition. We shared more intimate things and our reasoning for backing off when it came to a full on commitment. It was probably there that it should have been finalized, one way or the other but instead we just thanked each other for listening, understanding and continued to do our things together. Then, finally, one night we had both finally had enough and began to moan, complain and so on about how the other couldn't make the first move, or how things were obvious and we were both being dumb. Just people complaining for the sake of it and to get it off their chests. After that we finally shut one another up and decided to go for it. That was roughly three months ago and things have been incredible. Really the first relationship I feel comfortable in and am not staying around for out of guilt or manipulation. There are rough spots due to obvious things, but they're reasonable and understandable. Not childish, or cruel like other ones.",3QRYMNZ7FZ3JJDK32LPXWEX8S9KTNO,3QRYMNZ7FZ3JJDK32LPXWEX8S9KTNO,0.0

Being born in a small village in the West African country of Ghana gives me my uniqueness and an identity that has culture, history and politics in it. The village is called Dixcove after the British Captain who was called Captain Dixon who colonised the region in the 16th Century. My Mother is a Ghanaian and my Farther is from England, the North West a West Cumbrian. When I was four it was decided by my parents that I would live in England with my dad’s sister my Auntie Dot. ‘It was for the best reasons’ I have remembered my Auntie saying and after all it was the brave new world of the nineteen sixties, where the ‘civil rights’ movement was in its ascendency. Being sent to live in Egremount in West Cumbria had a number of challenges, not just for its white working class identity which served up a lot of prejudice for me; it was also the beginning of the sexual abuse that I had to endure as a child. My Auntie had two Sons and one Daughter. This was my home and where I lived with them, my cousins, my Auntie and my Uncles. From the age of seven up until the age of ten I was sexually abused by one of the boys on a weekly basis, apart from a three month period in each year. I was forced to act out sexual favours for him. He was eighteen at the time and the abuse would always happen in mine and my dad’s room. This is mentioned for the reason of if I was reading this I may ask ‘where was my dad when this was happening? Dads are supposed to protect you aren’t they?’ He lived in Ghana working and living with my Mum where he would spend nine months in Ghana and three months in England. As a black child, young adult who had no black friends, no black family members or black role models there has been a visible lack of ‘group identity’. My contact with blackness was watching Muhammad Ali win the heavy weight championship of the world, the Jackson Five singing ABC and the Brazilin footballer Pele being my school nickname given to me by my white peers. Having to live with experiencing sexual abuse has had a huge effect on me; anger, depression and anxiety have been emotions which were hard for me to live with but easy for me to relate to. Even so the sexual abuse had not affected the real sense of ‘uniqueness’ my situation gave me. It did not matter that there was a lack of blackness in my world to relate to, both subtle and overate messages every day gave negative, positive assurance of my sense of self, I felt black, it was certainly not the case of being proud of this fact after all I had been sexual abused as a child. Self-image has direct long term impact on self-esteem and is vital in helping a healthy development. When my cousin who sexual abused me told me ‘if I spoke to anyone about the sexual abuse no one would believe me because I was an outsider, a brown bugger no one wanted’ his words stopped me from saying anything to anyone.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF0TRUOH,0.0

I'm actually still shocked as to how amazing the entire evening went. Me and my boyfriend went to this beautiful Mexican restaurant, I had cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans while he had  steak chimichangas. The dinner was amazing and I'm sure the waitress was really happy too for the big tip she got. For months we had waited for this night. Tonight was the night that one of our favorite artists would be in town and we had bought tickets a long time ago. The artist was Electric Light Orchestra, and now that we were done eating we were heading to see the show. Tonight would be the last night I would see my boyfriend for the entire summer so we wanted to make it special. Me and my boyfriend absolutely love live music, one of our favorite things to do is go to shows and I'm so glad we went to this one. We couldn't believe it, Electric Light Orchestra opened with most favorite song! We spent the entire night listening to good music and eating food. We were in love and nothing could change that not even a summer apart from each other.  We didn't worry about a single thing all night, just enjoying ourselves and each other's company.  I don't think this is a night i'll ever forget the rest of my life and it's already been four months since it happened. My boyfriend is going to be back soon since summer is almost over, I can't wait. I usually don't wait this long to write into my diary but it's taken me this long just to process how magical this night was.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFCI8UOO,0.0

It had been raining quite a bit recently, so the service berry bushes were full.  We enjoyed eating service berries as we walked.  All along the pathways, especially when there was tall grass on either side, were a large number of dragonflies flying around.  I knew that there is a spring of water in the area, but I hadn't seen so many flying around at one time before!  We noticed a female deer resting among tall grass, but once she saw that we were no threat, she remained where she was.  We also saw ravens in a tree playing with little sticks. The weather was very nice that evening; it was nice to be outside with my spouse enjoying the fresh air. There was an avenue of blooming trees that we walked along, so fragrant.  The trees were also apparently full of wasps and bees, because they were buzzing so loudly!  Apparently we weren't the only ones enjoying the fragrant trees.  One thing that happened during the walk was that a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp it had caught!  It was big (both insects), and I was surprised to find out that dragonflies ate wasps. The dragonfly landed only briefly, and then flew away.

One odd thing that happened is I saw a friend who I used to work with at Walmart which was surprising as this area was quite a distance from where I thought this friend lived.  But, my friend told me she had recently moved to that area.  I was unable to go back to visit him when he took a turn for the worse within the next week and was sent to ICU.  I came down with the flu and I did not want to spread my germs in the hospital and definitely not to my brother.  The last thing I remember is the tight hug we shared and us both saying we loved each other.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JHYX09G,,0.0

I remember the last time I saw him in the hospital and I had no clue it would be the last time.  I mean, he was sick, but his doctor was telling him he would be getting out the next day.  He took a turn for the worse, though.  The last time I saw him alive was on March 17 which was St. Patrick's day.  My 12-year old son came with me and we stopped to get my brother a St. Patrick's day bouquet.  My son wanted this HUGE blow-up hat, too, so I got that as well.  It is hard to describe, but it was so tall, he had to duck to get in some of the doors.  My brother was sitting up in his chair watching a baseball game when I got there, and he was so happy to see us.  My mother was there, also, and they both laughed at my son's hat.  My brother talked with me for awhile and asked me to try to contact his wife who was in the Philippines at the time visiting family, and I tried, but I could not get her on the phone for him.  He then asked me if I had any sugar-free candy as I usually brought him some.  But, I didn't.  I told him I'd run out to the store to get him some.  It was Sunday and the gift shop in the lobby of the hospital was closed, so I went to the Walmart close by.  My brother lived in a town about 50 miles away, so I was surprised that I saw a former co-worker when I went to the Walmart.  We are Facebook friends, but I still had no clue she had moved recently to that city.  Anyway, my brother was so happy to have a little hard candy that was sugar free (I got him some peppermints) and he hugged me tight before I left.  I did not get a chance to come back to see him later that week when he went to ICU due to some heart issues as I came down with the flu and I feel badly about that.  But, I can still see his smile at the little bit of St. Patrick's day stuff I brought, and his happiness with the hard candy I went to get him.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JHYX09G,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JHYX09G,0.0

This brought back a flood of memories of our younger days when he was growing up. Baseball was such an important part of all of our lives.  Seeing him standing at the plate ready to swing at a pitch erased so many years in-between.  My husband coached him when he was starting out and through his high school years which culminated in his winning a scholarship to play in college.  We traveled all over watching him pitch and so this day, watching him play again made me go back in time in my head because all the sights and sounds were the same.  He stood in the batter's box in the same exact way.  So many things have happened since that earlier time.  He played professionally for a time.  He's since married and had a child but while I was sitting and watching him it might just as well have been 25 years ago.  Time goes by so quickly that we're hardly aware of the changes that happen.  It made me very happy to be brought back to that simpler time that day. I hope that he continues to play in the spring.  He swore he'd never play as an adult but it obviously agreed with him. He needs to keep it up.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JS0B099,,0.0

It was in my last year of college and at the time I was considering changing my major. I was a psychology major, but I wasn't able to pass my math class so I had to switch to sociology. Before the change, I was really nervous and unsure of myself. I tried to find comfort in the familiar stuff in order to cope. When I would get anxious, I was lucky to be surrounded by people that were supportive. My fiance would often play board games with me and that helped a lot. I found that petting my guinea pigs really helped me out too. In the moment, the anxiety felt very intense but I was able to overcome it for the most part. Although it never fully went away, I got better with dealing with it as time went on.  After switching to my sociology major, I found that a lot of my teachers were very nice. The homework got easier for me, and it felt like it was a major that I belonged in. Although I initially wanted to study psychology, sociology was a good compromise. They are two related fields that are similar in some regards. Being in a new and better environment really helped my anxiety too.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A19YNUFV,0.0

I. had slightly anxiety before in high school where I developed a fear that I would be single forever and not find a husband. I had my ups and downs with it all the way when I entered grad school that was not debilitating. Then on October 2018 it hit me the hardest. I developed debilitating anxiety over the smallest things. My first thoughts were that I may be gay which scared me for some reason because I know I not. There it went on to where I could not watch romantic movies or high school romance (which I love to watch) because I did not want to have single anxiety. Even when I was happy it would not last long because I felt like it would be stripped away from me. For instance thoughts of my parent dying. Im 23 and my parents are only 50. They have a while and they are highly responsible. The odds are quite slim but sometimes the fear feels so real. I would have panic attacks in the middle of the night several days throughout the week over these dark thought I sought counseling immediately and that has helped me greatly where I had to slowly change my thought process into a positive . I am now in recovery where my body sometimes misses the anxiety because its been a part of my life for about a year and I have slight relapses every now and then. I used to have weekly sessions with my counselors, but I developed the tools and actions where I only go check-ups.

Me and her owner met eyes, I was distracted by this. Suddenly, Maxwell and the other dog start barking at each other in a way I've never heard him bark before. He broke the leash from my grip and ran off with the other dog into the woods next to the park. The owner and me, who's name I learned is Amanda, run off after our dogs hoping to catch them, but they were going much faster than usual. Me and Amanda gave up on our chase and exchanged information so we can keep in touch while looking for our dogs. Today I get a call from Amanda saying she wants to go back to the park looking for our dogs so I agree. We met up around 9am this morning and started our search around where we left off yesterday. We shouted our dogs names and asked every stranger in the park if they had seen our dogs along with showing pictures that we had on our phones. No one had seen them. By 1pm we are hopeless and decide to walk to the gazebo over-looking most of the park. When we get there we look off the edge of the balcony of the gazebo out into the fields of the park and can see two dogs running back and forth with a frisbee. I had hope that Maxwell was down there. Me and Amanda made our way down the hill towards the two dogs and it was definitely Maxwell. I call for him, but he only stops are stares at me almost as if he didn't expect me to find him again. I ran up and grabbed him by the collar and Amanda grabbed her dog as well. As we separated them they cried and whined. Our dogs had fallen in love.",,3QY5DC2MXS6MVYMB42WUT5A1ALLUF4,0.0

Over a dozen years have passed, and Fuzzy has gotten old. He has had repeated health issues, but he still maintains his good spirits. However, now they are becoming much more serious. He started having seizures, and there is little we can do to stop him. We've taken him to the vet, but the vet says that the cost would outtweigh the benefits since he only has about a year or so left to live anyways. Of course, everything gets old and age takes it toll on everyone. However, when you're young, you think everything lasts forever. Unfortunately, a dog's life is not nearly so enduring and I know that soon I'll have to let Fuzzy go. I'll always remember the good times of playing with him and petting him. I know I won't remember him at the end. I'll just try to savor every moment I have with him while I still can before he inevitably passes away.

It isn't something that runs in the family my son is a first. So it may even have an impact on him years from now. It has undeniably changed our lives. we now have to do things differently in the way that we choose to live. Being that my son has diabetes we don't really eat anymore how we used to eat. we eat a lot less foods with sugars in them processed or added sugars in lunches and dinners. Sometimes it can be hard because he still can't eat certain foods at all. It makes our food very limited in what we eat. we had a short hospital stay that taught me a lot more than just basic care of the child. with type 1 diabets it taught me how to have a different perspective on life in general.

My five year son had been acting odd peeing the bed, excessively drinking and eating a ton of food for about two weeks so I decided to take him in to the doctor. I was sitting  in the physician's office waiting on his urine test result when she came in to tell us yes there was glucose in his urine and next we would do a finger stick. The fingerstick reading was 562. We were in utter shock as she told us we needed to rush him to the hospital immediately and could not stop at home to grab clothes. In the ER the antibody tests were run, we were told we would need to stay in the hospital for three days for Type one diabetes training. I stared at my little boy in the hospital bed hooked up to an IV in disbelief. I could not believe that just hours ago I had given him breakfast without a care in the world and now he would need insulin with each meal to even survive. It was so hard to wrap my head around the fact that without insulin my child would die and he would need it for the rest of his life. The next days were filled with holding down a crying five year old giving him shots, him tearfully asking when his diabetes would go away and me sneaking in to the hospital bathroom to cry. It was a time of grieving the life that he would never have, a life without insulin. It was a time of sorting thru the mess and finding hope as well. Seeing the tiny triumphs of him not crying thru his last finger pokes in the hospital and his excitement to leave the hospital behind and just head back to being a child with a few minor adjustments. As much as that time shook me to my core and brought me to my knees with grief I also saw strength and hope in a child that I never imagined I would see. I may be here to raise and protect my son but he is my hero and he saved me by teaching me that there is hope and light in even the darkest of circumstances.",,3QY7M81QH88VD92TS5UGZQOMA537KD,0.0

It was hard for everyone to believe that less than six months later this young lady would be taken away. The university in North Carolina where she worked honored her life on their campus. The young lady was responsible for securing grants for students and underprivileged individuals to attend the university, who without her efforts would never have been able to do so.

The boss said they enjoyed a beautiful sunny day and that the daughter had been happy and was doing what she did best; helping others. There wasn't a dry eye in the place after her very vivid and poignant memory of their last encounter.

I admit, the car was my style. I got in the car and took a right turn out of the dealer parking lot heading down Main Street. I saw a friend of mine walking towards the coffee shop and honked hoping they would turn their head and notice me. She did and gave a smile and a thumbs up. I turned right again onto Laurel Street and the car made a little noise. Nothing too major but enough to get me to notice. As I continued down Laurel Street, the car made a few more noises. This was concerning me so I decided to end my test drive and head back to the lot. As I was driving, I began to notice smoke coming from underneath the hood. I knew this was not good. I just kept thinking, I just want to make it back to the lot. As I was a couple of blocks away from the lot, the car just died on me. Right in the middle of traffic. How embarrassing. The cars behind me began to blow their horns. I was blocking traffic. I could not believe my luck. I was so embarrassed. I got out the car and slammed the doors. I just threw up my hands and walked away. I left the car right there. I walked back to the lot and angrily threw the keys on the desk of the car salesman and told him what happened. He became uptight because I left the car there. Piece of junk.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7EUEGCD,0.0

He had passed just a few days prior and many in the family were torn up about it. I had known him to be a decent guy. Like many older people I meet, he was a little brash and a little racist, but if he liked you, he treated you well. He always treated me well, but I had heard stories about him that suggested he wasn’t always the best person. But I never want to see death and I felt sad for the family about it regardless. When it came time for anyone to say a few words about him, no one said anything, which I found odd. I almost wanted to just out of pure awkwardness. I’ve only been to a handful of viewings and one other funeral in my life, so I never really know quite what to do or say or what others are supposed to do or say, but it just didn’t feel right. I didn’t ask about it, though, in case I were to offend anyone. Some cried, so I knew they felt emotional, but maybe they just didn’t know what to say. It’s hard telling, really. In the end, it was just several hours of me feeling weird, uncomfortable and awkward. But it wasn’t about me, so I didn’t make it about me. I was there for her family and that’s what counted.",3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZB8BIMO,,0.0

It was the first time that happened in a while. It's funny because we can go months without a single fight, but as soon as one happens it hurts just like it used to when we fought daily. We had both had some drinks, like usual. We drank probably about 12 beers between the 2 of us and it was a Friday night, so Tommy decided to buy Fireball as well. He had been in a shitty stressed out mood and had worked a lot of hours, but the night started out okay. We listened to music and then were invited to a bonfire down the road at one of our neighbors. We have a toddler, but the night was warm and we were just gonna stop by for a minute. We got her bundled up, and she enjoyed walking in her stroller. At that time eveyrthing was fine. What started the fight was when Tommy finally came home. Tommy had a few more shots of his Fireball while we were at the neighbors, and I grew  tired of having to chase around my toddler. After all, it was getting late. So I went home with the baby...Tommy was supposed to be following me, but didn't get home for another 30 minutes. I was irritated and kinda bitchy, because he always does this crap to me. He works so hard and for so many hours, and then wants to spend time with everyone else when he is home. So I WAS being a bitch, and I was tired...and of course he completely goes off and gets defensive. He never sees my side of the story, and I never get to have any sort of negative feelings ...but whatever. I'm used to keeping my mouth shut. It wasn't until after the baby went to bed when we started pushing each other around a little bit. Our physical fights are few and far between and they're not as bad as they once were...but still everyone is bullcrap. It's pathetic I gotta keep my emotions in....and I'm getting so sick of it! I will not live like this for another 12 years!!",3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZDPDMIU,,0.0

He threw some papers on my desk and told me ""You need to do an evaluation."" I asked him on what and he told me on the new restaurant across the state. I've never been in that part of the area before! I asked if he was sure he wanted me to do it, sure it was across town but maybe someone who knew the area more would do it. He told me that he wanted me to do it. So I agreed, got the company credit card and planned out meal costs and gas cost while I had the boss with me. I was allocated $500 for the day trip. I assumed that would be more than enough. The next morning, I got up early and looked at the directions to the restaurant that I was needed to go to and set off for the trip. It was supposed to take 8 hours to get there so I blasted some music to keep the trip interesting. A couple of hours of driving, the landscape was all beaches  from the highway. It was beautiful and I thought to myself ""Well, this is worth the drive!"" I ended up stopping for lunch at a roadside place that I expected to be bad food. But the food was so good! The people were really nice and gave me some tips on landmarks to see before I left. They were a 5 minute drive from my lunch spot, so I drove down and ended up getting a flat tire. I called AAA to come take care of it and they told me it would take an hour for them to get there. That was fine. I called my boss to let him know I had a flat and I might be using more than the $500 allocated to me. During the wait, I walked around the landmarks since I was there. Took some photos and even saw a car wreck on the highway! It was something out of a movie. AAA came and fixed my tire and soon I was back on the road.",,3R2UR8A0IB28IFTZ8AQ706IJVFDOXH,0.0

My sister and her daughter were with me. This was my first cruise and I had to go because my sister paid for it! It started out with a short flight into Texas where we then drove to Galveston to board the ship. We finally did board and went through all the required things that you have to do on a cruise ship. Our room was beautiful but a little cramped with the three of us. But we had a balcony which made it worth the inconvenience. We sailed for two days. Watching the ocean from the balcony was so relaxing and beautiful. We ate meals in the dining room. Fabulous food. On the third day we entered port at Cozumel. There was a lot of touristy stuff to look at, but we were headed to a beach to sit in the sun and swim in the ocean. It was very hot and humid.  We found a beach and spent the day there. We ate at a real Mexican restaurant. While on the ship we got to see some shows for entertainment. Our next stop was at Progresso. Very sad place. We did another beach trip and again laid in the sun and swam in the ocean. Taking the bus back thru town after that was really eye-opening. The poverty of that town was so sad. Little more than hovels and dirty streets. Back on the ship we again dined at the eateries. We spent some time on the way home lounging on deck or by one of the many pools.",3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZA564UAH,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZA564UAH,0.0

It was a beautiful day. This particular trail was rather difficult. Although I had hiked it many times, I felt more physically exhausted than usual. I quickly realized I was going to have a tough day on the trail. There were several points along the hike where I thought about turning around. However, I kept moving forward. When I reached the summit of the mountain I felt a great sense of personal pride and accomplishment. I love hiking and I consider it a big part of who I am as a person. I spent at least two years of my life hiking several times a month. I would mostly go hiking alone. I like hiking alone because I learn something new about myself each time. The time I spend alone with myself in the mountains is very valuable. On this particular hike I realized that the trail does not always just hand you a victory. This is a valuable lesson that I hope to carry with me through other areas of my life.",3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZACGSUAW,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZACGSUAW,0.0

It was a really difficult thing for me to do and i had a lot of memories in that place but it just wasn't feasible for me anymore. when i finally go down to selling it i was pretty bummed out. this was the home of my childhood and i was never going to see it again. But as they say time heals all wounds. i do wish i had the financial capital to keep the place but i am not that rich. my friends and family were very supportive of my decision. and even help me pick out a new place that was quite nice. mostly because i am terrible at shopping. i have come to terms with my decision though, even though it feels like closing a chapter of my life i am now opening a new one. My personal journey to accepting to sell was a bit of a rough one. i had almost backed out several times if it weren't for my better judgement. not to mention the support of my family. i honestly couldn't have gone through it without them. Here's hoping to a bright future for me and future home prospects.",,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZAE5XAUX,0.0

I was unaware he was so keen to what is going on in my personal life. His father passed away about a year and a half ago and it has been really rough on me. I try to hide this from him but I guess he picked up on it. The poem he wrote seemed to be in the style of dr seuss. Part of my suspicion is confirmed by the fact that the picture on the front shows both of us in a tall striped hat. The poem read as this. ""Sometimes mom cries, and thats okay, because I love her on mothers day. Shes a good mom and makes me food, shes a girl but a real cool dude."" I was shocked to know that he sees me crying or is at at least aware of it. It made me re think how i show my emotions and my abilities as a mother. I want to show him i am strong but feel so weak. I very much wish he had a good male role model. My father passed away long ago, and my husbands family lives across the country. I need guidance but dont know where to look.

We partied like rockstars. Seeing the falls was so awe inspiring too. It really helped sober us up. Just enough to go back to the bar that afternoon and get drunk again. We even smoked a little weed for old times sake. We hot boxed that SUV like we were in high school over again. It felt like the summer of 1995 in Billy's mom's Tahoe.

This has been a dream of his for many years.  About 4 months ago, I decided to look around online in our area, to see if I could find a bike that would work for him to turn into a track bike, to make it his own.  I did not have a lot of money to spend, so I had to look carefully.  I may be a woman, but we are both riders, so I know a thing or two about them.  We've had discussions about this topic in the pat, and I already knew that I wanted to make this happen for him.  He's a very hard worker, and he deserves it very much!  I ended up finding 3 of them that I was interested in, so I began to write the owners and ask them questions about the motorcycles.  I narrowed my search down to the one that I thought would work the best for him, and then I told him I found him a bike!  He was so excited, so we went and looked at it that weekend, and purchased it.  This will be a good project for us to over the winter months, to get it ready for him to ride it on the tracks next year!  It needs some cosmetic work done mainly, and a little more mechanically.  We had to buy tires immediately so that he could ride it and see what he needed to do to it, to make him happy with it.

This drug was supposed to be helping to control my cravings for alcohol and heroin.  These had been my drugs of choice for several years now. I had continued to struggle with despite multiple stints attempts at detox and six months at an inpatient rehab. During my latest latest relapse I had entered detox again at my local hospital.  During a little over a week there, I was given several drugs that were supposed to help prevent further relapse from occurring.  It seemed to be working at first. Especially while still in the hospital.  But I quickly became convinced something was wrong. It seemed to be helping immensely with the alcohol cravings, but my cravings for heroin had increased tenfold.  I reentered the detox facility and questioned the doctors.  I was told it was all in my head and to keep it and quickly released.  The cravings worsened. The cravings worsened and I relapsed on heroin.  The relapse worsened and I OD'd.  Fortunately, my boyfriend discovered me and called 911. I was taken by ambulance to the emergency room and revived.  Upon recovery it was discovered that one of the drugs given to me was in fact an opiate derivative and had not only not reduced my cravings but caused my relapse.",,3R8YZBNQ9I4HOC0O5AEDVC0VJCBQ7G,0.0

In the process I have gone though many specialists, have been hospitalized for 9 days and have been on a lot of soul sucking medications. I have heard I have epilepsy directly correlating with my right temporal lobe. I have heard I have psychogenic seizures caused by severe complex post traumatic stress disorder due to my life being full of catastrophic events beyond my control. I have heard I am damaging my brain and my short term memory and I am not doing anything to my brain. Eventually I got a 5th opinion about a month ago recommended by my welfare doctor who had seen me once and to me I just seemed like a number. Welfare has been helpful money wise but as far as a decent doctor is concerned, I am not convinced. Either way I had high hopes that I would maybe get a definitive answer. Instead I was lead to disappointment when the office refused to do testing to trigger a seizure, which I asked for so they had current and accurate data. Its usually common proceedure to do at least a strobe light test on someone with seizures to see if its epileptic or non epileptic, this doctor did a 20 eeg of me taking a nap. My main triggers are stress, they kept trying to convince me my activity would still be abnormal if I had epilepsy which is not what I had heard. I also had brought all records I had from all hospitals and doctors and this new doctor did not review any of them, just asked who I saw and said so and so is great doctor and he is more than likely right. Immediately my heart sank, I guess he doesn't give his own professional opinions and only goes off of other doctors opinions. He did prescribe me something for my migraines (typical when convulsing to have a migraine prior), and said something about we will call your ""episodes"" seizures for now. My father was very upset.  So I am back at square one, even more frustrated and still having multiple grand mal seizures a week.",,3R8YZBNQ9I4HOC0O5AEDVC0VJCBQ7G,0.0

It was tough. The words just felt unnatural (at least in my head). I don't know if I said it to avoid the awkward silence or if I meant it. I really have only a few firsthand memories of my father growing up, all of which were positive. My mom always spoke poorly of him. I think I just believed he was this druggie/alcoholic loser that she made him out to be although I never saw him drunk or stoned that I was aware of. He lived out of state most of my life. From what I've been told, my parents eloped in Vegas after I was conceived and divorced before I was a year old. My mom never remarried or really even dated. But now that I'm getting to know him more, I'm learning there's a lot more than the labels my mom put on him and ingrained into my head. I'm kind of angry I never got the opportunity to learn this sooner. I remember always being afraid to ask for things without fearing some form of guilt relating to my father. When I was in middle school, I really wanted to play the saxophone. I worked up the courage to ask my mom. Per usual, she would tell me it was too expensive and to ""ask your father"". I was mentally punished for who my father was my entire life but I didn't even know him. Now that I'm getting to know him more as an adult, I wholeheartedly agree that I am a lot like him (looks, personality, etc.). I was always the black sheep of the family, so it's legit mind boggling to me to have so much in common with a relative for like the first time ever. I call him by his first name. I don't know if I'll ever adjust to calling him ""dad"" but I do remember I would dream of having a dad in my life as a kid. I think I am finally learning to understand myself, accept myself, and be myself.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGT4VUBK,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGT4VUBK,0.0

I saw other friends that I haven't seen for months and one that I haven't seen for closer to a year. We reconnected and I felt a warm feeling of togetherness. We reminisced on things that happened years ago. I stayed the night at their place and we went out to get food in the morning. It was nice to hang out with them in a more sober sense. I made sure that my surprise and gratitude was genuine and not just the effects of alcohol. Turns out it was genuine and I beat myself up for thinking I was ever ostracized from them.

I don't really like to have to sit down for long I just like to stay active. Doing things just helps my mind stay clear of doubt and worry. Those things when thought about could become very hard from some to deal with. Unfortunatly about 6 months ago I ended up getting into a bad accident. It was terrible because it was totally unexpected no one was looking forward to this issue. I ended up breaking my ankle in that accident which caused me a lot of issues. I basically had to learn how to walk again. after spending almost all of my time being alive walking and running that had came to a halt. I couldn't do those things anymore it was hard for me to do. Learning how to walk again after a personal tragedy is no small feat. It's crazy to think maybe one day this could happen. It changes your mindset and makes you see things in a whole new way.

I had broken my ankle in a way that the doctor's thought I was going to lose my foot. I had been out for a walk, and tripped and my ankle just snapped. I was alone, but thankfully a school bus driver pulled over and called 911 and tried to keep me calm while we waited for help. After having surgery and a few casts, I did't think I would ever be able to walk like I did before. I had to go back to the basis with learning to walk. I never realized how hard it was for babies to learn. I thought that I could just get a cane, hop a little and be on my way. That did not happen. I had to have someone walking behind me while I used a walker and took tiny, little steps. I was shocked at how hard it was, and how I had taken being able to get up and walk around when I wanted for granted. My life had completely changed, and while I was taken steps both physically, mentally and literally in the right direction to get it back on track. It was hard and there were many tears and if I could have walked properly, I know I would have stormed off a time or two. But, now months later, why I still walk with a limp most days, I can at least walk. Not how I used to be able to, but I'm thankfully I can at least storm off if I ever need to.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGVLXBU3,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGVLXBU3,0.0

I didn't have any exact thoughts about an animal nor did I really have an inclination that I really wanted an animal that day.  As I was getting out of the car I noticed the set up and they had some of the animals in a trailer and some of the larger dogs outside on the grass in a small fenced in area.  The larger dogs outside seemed to be having a good time barking at cars and the others milling about.  As I was looking one dog in particular just looked sad.  I walked up to the fence area and she just looked up at me and didn't make much a fuss that I was even there.  I picked up her card and his name was Mop and he was 3 years old and the card stated he was owner surrender because his owners went into a nursing home.  How sad I thought as I walked off and kept looking around at all the animals.  As I was making my rounds my eye continued to go back Mop.  As I walked back to where Mop sat I decided that he was coming home with me. I did the paperwork and Mop and I went to the pet store to get what he was going to need to live with me.  As we walked around the store Mop didn't seem interested at all.  When we got home I showed him his new bed and toys.  He laied down on his bed immediately and started rolling all around.  He seemed potty trained and indicated at the door when he wanted to go out.  The first day I just pretty much followed him around and making sure he knew where everything was and telling him no when he was looking at something I didn't want him to be messing with.  The first night (and every night since) Mop has slept at the end of my bed during the night with no issues.  The impact has been amazing because Mop has just become a part of my everyday life.,,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWN8UB2,0.0

I finally found the perfect house to rent with a fenced in back yard included so I was finally able to make my dream of adopting a dog my reality! I went down to the shelter and was greeted by a friendly adoption specialist named Sandy. I told Sandy I was looking for a dog that had been at the shelter awhile and had still not been adopted, because I truly wanted to give a dog like that a chance at a great life with me. Sandy immediately told me she had the perfect dog in mind. His name was Chance and he had been at the shelter for almost nine months,. He was a large pit bull mix who had been rescued from a fighting ring during a police raid.  After months of one on one therapy with a dog trainer who specialized in working with dogs who had been mistreated he was finally seen as adoptable. Unfortunately because of his past, people looked him right over because he looked so intimidating and barked aggressively upon first meeting. I was taken back to see Chance in this cage and he barked at me but stopped as I bent down to his level and held out my hand. To Sandy's shock as well as my own, he actually licked my hand! After that moment I knew he was meant for me and I took him home. I already had my home ready for a dog and he had a blast sniffing all over everything in sight. I prepared a bowl of dogfood topped with wet dog food. Chance gobbled the food down and fell asleep on the rug. I tried to get him to sleep in the bed with me but he didn't want to leave his special spot on the rug. Chance will never be the type of dog who can run around the dog park or have another dog or cat in our home, but I believe with all my heart that Chance was meant to be my dog.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWN8UB2,,0.0

We stayed at the bar for most of the night. Throughout the night, I drank a lot, and got very drunk. In my drunken state, I decided that I should walk home. I lived close enough to the bar that it would be about a 20 minute walk home. On the way walking home, I tripped over a place where the concrete slabs were uneven. I fell to my right, and into a chain link fence, in front of the house on my street. As I stood back up, I could feel a lot of pain in my arm, and as I reached up I could feel blood on that part of my arm. I couldn't really see the cut since it was dark on the street, but I figured I must have scrapped my upper arm along a sharp piece of the fence. I held the cut and continued on quickly to my house, as it was bleeding quite a lot. I got inside, went to the bathroom and examined my arm. I was shocked by the amount of blood on my shirt, as I pulled it off. There was a lot of blood and the cut was quite deep. I did my best to wash my cut in the sink, before deciding to just use the shower instead, I washed the cut as well as I could and grabbed a towel, which I held very tightly to the cut. After holding the towel to my arm for about 15 to 20 minutes, the bleeding had slowed but not stopped. I replaced the towel with some clean paper towels, and held them tightly for another 10 minutes. Since I still couldn't get the bleeding to stop, I decided that I might need to go to the hospital. So I got some new paper towels, made a thick pad, and covered the cut, wrapped it in an ace bandage, put on a new clean shirt and called a lyft to go to the nearest hospital. When I got to the emergency room, I told the nurse what had happened, and filled out a lot of paperwork. Eventually I got to see a doctor, who looked at the cut, and decided I needed stitches. I got 5 stitches, and a tetanus shot, since I was cut by outdoor, probably dirty metal. After getting treated at the hospital, I went back home, quickly cleaned the bathroom as best I could, and went to bed.",,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGWOUUBQ,0.0

One night last June after having a few (or more than a few) cocktails at a bar about 1 mile from my house, I decided to walk home instead of drive. I was pretty drunk and got to about 3 blocks from my house. Of course being drunk, I decided to text a woman that I know, and see if she'd respond. She did and as I was walking I was texting her back. I wasn't watching where I was walking and ended up taking a fall after tripping over a piece of sidewalk that was sticking up from tree roots growing under it. I not only hit my head but didn't catch myself correctly and dislocated my shoulder. I knew I was hurt pretty badly and it was late at night. I was drunk enough to think that I would be better off if I just laid here for a while. I was only one block from a hospital but didn't want to get up and go there. I ended up making the decision to get up (after over 30 minutes) and try to make it home. I didn't realize the extent of my injury so that's what I thought would be best. I got up and walked the 3 blocks to my house, got in the front door, laid down and passed out. I slept for a good 2 hours or so and when I woke up in a pool of blood, and realized that my shoulder was injured badly. I decided I better go to the hospital. I got up and walked to the emergency room. I ended up getting a stitch in my nose and having my arm put back in the socket.

They say it's the city that never sleeps and they aren't exaggerating! I was also surprised how friendly everyone was. I had no trouble striking up conversations with strangers wherever we went. We had a lot of things planned for each day so we were very busy all the time. It was night to get away and just let loose with some great friends. The trip really strengthened the bond between everyone who attended. I remember feeling very accepted and glad that I went. It can be difficult for everyone to get together these days. Between jobs, partners and just life in general, finding time is not always as easy as it was. I'll always remember this trip and the fun we all had.

I still cannot believe he had a stroke a few short days ago.  He is pretty young at 58 years old to have one, but I know it can happen to anyone, regardless of age.  Mom dais he was sitting at the table eating dinner wehen he got a strange look on his face and had strange movements.  After that shock passed, he tried to speak but had a horrible time with it.  Despite all the signs of something is really wrong. Mike refused to believe he couldn't shake it off.  Mom was freaking out because she knew without a doubt he had a stroke and wanted to call 911.  But, Mike is the most stubborn man I have ever known.  He was able to communicate to not call an ambulance, and he was adamant about it.  Thank goodness he finally relented, but still.  He saw the doctor and was in the hospital for a couple of days.  He transferred to a rehab facility yesterday.  Mom has been a trooper.  She really hasn't left his side for a minute.  I bet she was terrified witnessing him go through that but she won't dwell on it or talk about it.  I need to make sure she takes time for herself in the coming weeks.  She takes too much on and needs Mike to do the work now.  She can encourage him, but should not be by his side every second of the day.  I imagine it is too early to get concerned.  A lot to come and a lot of work for Mike.  It will be interesting to see if he uses his stubbornness to really work on the rehab.  I bet he will and is up to the challenge.",,3RGU30DZTBUJNS3YEQWTHTLZPM2JM2,0.0

Usually for me that means I had some amazing food at some super trendy brunch place with artisanal waffles or something, but I honestly can't remember the food this time. I remember getting up early that day and starting to pour some cereal, and my wife stopped me and said we should go out instead. I thought that was odd since it was so last minute, and we got dressed really quick to head out the door to the corner diner. Before I could get through placing my order, my wife just blurted out ""I'm pregnant"" with this huge smile on her face. She couldn't contain herself or even wait for us to get to the meal. The waitress, Rita, squealed with delight, and I jumped up and we all three embraced. We've been trying for quite some time, and this was such great news. We spent the whole breakfast planning out our future and talking about how this would change everything for the better. Our waitress gave us some tips on parenting as she has children of her own. My wife got a little sad at the end because she had imagined this big fancy way of telling me and this was so rushed and last minute instead. I told her it was perfect, because it was perfect. This was such a surprise as we'd both almost given up hope, and the way she told me was just so filled with joy and surprise that it fit so well with the surprise we'll be expecting soon. I want to tell more people than just our new waitress friend Rita, but it's too early for that.

I moved to Northern Idaho in February after living in Reno off and on for about 11 years. It was the end of summer camping trip and we were throwing a going away party for my brother, who was moving back to California. I had not seen my Uncle in about 8 or 9 years because he was living in California when I moved to Reno. A huge fire took out the town he lived in, Paradise, so he relocated to Washington. It was a birthday surprise for my brother, so my uncle came and met us at the river. It had been so long since I seen him, I ran and gave him a huge hug once he got there. I had tears welling up in my eyes and was so incredibly excited. We sat by the water and talked about all the years that we had missed and all the times that we had planned on making new memories. I was excited for my kids to get to know my uncle and excited for him to get to know them. We had a great day, one I had waited for for a long time! My uncle told me that he is looking for a house in the same town in Idaho that I live in. I was so excited to hear this! We talked about all the barbecues and fun things we are going to do together. It was the start of rekindling our relationship. My uncle has always been incredibly important to me growing up, so to have him back in my life means the world to me!",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMUR7B4E,,0.0

We LOVE camping but there was something extra special about this trip- well, two things actually. The first one being that my brother was leaving a couple days later to move back to California for work. The second thing is that my uncle was going to come meet us at camp and stay for the day. I am from a small town in California called Paradise, that was decimated by wildfire last year. My uncle moved to Washington after the fire and I moved to Idaho ( I was not living in Paradise at the time of the fire though so thankfully I didn't lose my home or anything like that). Anyway, like I said my uncle was going to meet us at camp. I was so incredibly excited for this because I had not seen him in about 11 years! When we got to camp I did not have cell phone service so I was unsure as to whether or not he would actually make it (camp was a 1 and a half hour drive from his home). I was so excited to see him walking up that I nearly started to cry. I ran to him, barefoot through the woods, and gave him the biggest hug ever! There are no words to accurately describe that moment. It's like gaining a family member back in your life that you thought was gone forever. We hadn't seen each other in that long because I had moved to Reno, Nevada about 8 years prior and we just sort of lost touch over the years. My uncle is someone who I have always looked up to so seeing him was extra special. We sat by the lake, enjoyed lunch, and caught up on all the time we had missed. I am so very excited to have my uncle back in my life. While it was bittersweet because at the same time as that visit, I realized I was saying goodbye to my brother (he is now in California nearly 14 hours away from me in North Idaho), it was so fulfilling to see my uncle. You just never know where life will take you and who can unexpectedly come back into your life when you aren't anticipating it. I miss my brother since he moved, but I have my uncle back. I am so excited to spend more time with him, catching up, and him getting to know my family.",3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMUR7B4E,3RRCEFRB7NYX1JGGKUJGXBLMUR7B4E,0.0

I booked it, and rushed to pack and leave to get to the station (20 minutes away, 90 minutes before departure). When I got there, I was denied the ability to board. My identification had recently expired. I told them my story; begged, pleaded. Nothing. I felt profoundly hopeless, hysterical, self-loathing, and broken. With no other options, I returned to where I was staying. As it turned out, I would not have made it. My dog went sometime in her sleep in the night before I would have arrived.

My entitled aunt accused my nephew, my sisters son who is 15, of stealing from her purse. Here is what happened. We were having a family get together for my sisters birthday and most of the family was there. Aunt comes in late, as usual, with her bratty daughter (15) in tow. Aunt places her purse by the front door. It's a huge monstrosity of a bag that is open at the top. This will be important later. They complain about the food all through lunch. We just ignore this and continue with fun of the day. After lunch, the parents are all drinking coffee in the dining room while the younger kids play and watch movies in the salon by the front door. Entitled cousin does not want to watch the movie that is on, I think it was Frozen, saying it is lame and is a kids movie.  She takes the remote and changes it to Game of Thrones. All the other kids are mad and complain that the show is too scary.  A tussle ensues for the remote and in the course of the wrestling, Aunts bag is knocked over and items scatter onto the floor.  My Sister comes in and tells everyone to quiet down, changes the show back to Frozen and takes the remote which makes Entitled cousin cry and scream that Nephew hit her and wants him punished. Aunt comes in and yells at Nephew that Cousin should have what she wants and for Nephew to stop being a brat. Then Aunt sees her bag knocked over and starts screaming at Nephew that he is stealing from her. She picks up her bag and says her FitBit is missing. I roll my eyes because of all the crap in that bag, how would she know immediately that her FitBit is missing. Aunt demands Nephew turns his pockets out. Nephew says he does not have her FitBit and to leave him alone. Sister tells Aunt that her Nephew does not have her FitBit and maybe she should look under the couch where her bag fell over. One of the other kids does just this and does find her FitBit. Aunt yells at Nephew saying he stowed it there for later so Sister tells Aunt that this is rediculous and it is time for them to leave.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6H1OMSPM,0.0

When I decided to go to his house to ask for his hand, his father humiliated me for being from a Venezuelan family. Later he sent his daughter to study in another state to get her away from me. I still have contact through social networks but. Unfortunately, your parents will never accept me and I prefer not to cause problems in your life. Since then I have been depressed because that has caused me psychological trauma. I definitely do not wish anyone anything because it makes you feel like the worst of the worst. It makes you feel bad enough. My family has tried to help me and I have gradually overcome the problem. I decided to start studying a career and now I'm doing better. The loss of this love affected me a lot and so far I do not understand why discrimination. I think that should end. Things for migrants should be different.

So, I go visit my mother to see how she and my little sister is doing. I don't get to see her much these days because I am always working. My nephew who is 21 years old lives with my mom at the moment, and my aunt had came down to visit for a few weeks. So I figured this would be a good opportunity to see everyone. When I get to my mom's house I notice that my mother isn't home, my little sister tells me she went to the grocery store to get something to drink and bread. I decide to wait and then I start talking to my little sister about school and how she is doing. Before I can finish asking her another question, I hear a loud bang followed by some curse words. I run to the living to see what is going on and see my aunt charging at my nephew and my nephew pushing her back with his hand. I ask, what is going on!? She replies, I caught Nunu (my nephew), going in my purse while I was coming out of the bathroom. I look at Nunu and he explains to me that he didn't go in her purse, he was looking for his charger and her purse was on top of it. He insists on checking him and for her to check the purse for anything missing. She declines to because she says she is sure that he went through her purse. I told them both that they need to calm down in my mothers house and talk their issues out. My aunt wasn't trying to hear any of that. She is a little crazy and has to take medication to remain calm.  As time went by, I can tell that my aunt is starting to feel stupid about accusing my nephew.  And during all of this they are exchanging foul words to each other, and I guess my aunt had enough. She swung at him two times hitting him in the face. I break her off of him and tell her that she needs to leave because she is causing trouble at my mom's house. She then calls the cops, playing the victim, and the cops take her to the bus station to go back to Pennsylvania.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6H1OMSPM,0.0

It all happened so fast, about a week ago when I saw my ex boyfriend with another lady in a fancy restaurant. I was walking my dog about 4 miles from where I live. Obviously angered by how abusive he was to me, I ran straight at him with tears trying to escape my eyes screaming his name. As soon as I got to him, all he had to say was ""what the fuck are you doing here, I thought I told you not to ever stalk me"".  This guy has always maltreated me but the love I have for him has made me blind so I end up being the to beg him. I endured this abusive relationship for far too long was the next thought that crossed my mind after he said all those shit to me. I tried to hit him on the face but I missed, he grabbed me tightly and almost thought about strangling me with his hands before my 3 year old Rottweiler jump on the table and bit his fingers and other parts of his body. It was a nightmare in the restaurant , a gory scene. And soon after I started to regret every of my actions. I thought to myself, if you had just walked away it wouldn't have gotten to this. The restaurant owner called the medics and was reluctant on calling the cops on me. Soon as the medics arrived, I got into the van with them and I was also saparated from my dog. I guess they too him to animal control. In the hospital, the doctors carried out x-rays and ran some tests on my ex boyfriend. He had a lot of open wounds so he had to get stitches and one of his fingers was also broken, so they got that fixed up also. I really wished I could go back in time and avoid causing problems.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6HIZ3SP6,0.0

Her departure very much feels like “The End.” She’s excited about her new adventure. Most important is the fact that she’s excited about going.  You aren't doing anything wrong—this is just a normal part of growing up. Teens who are trying to find independence need to differentiate themselves from parents and family and express their own strong opinions and ideas of how things should be done. Don't conclude that your child has always hated you and that their real nature is coming out now that they're leaving for college. It's just part of the separation process and is a temporary stage of development. Don't take it to heart; it's not your child talking—it's the fear of leaving home and entering the adult world that's lashing out at you. Many parents use social media to keep track of their kids at college and ask their children to ""friend"" them so they can maintain contact. . Part of growing up involves facing difficult or challenging moments and finding a way through those hard times. Signs of maturity include flexibility, adaptability, and resilience, and college is the ideal time to work on these skills. But if situations escalate to the point at which they threaten your child's physical or mental health—or put them in jeopardy—step in and offer aid. But ask for permission first. You want to support your child as much as possible but not to the extent that you dismantle the initial foundation of self-sufficiency. Finding the right balance will take time, but eventually, you'll both get there.",,3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2K0TLLV,0.0

About three months ago something amazing happened to me. I bought my first home! The process was a long and drawn out one but so worth it in the end. I looked at house after house after house and finally settled on the perfect one for me. I started the process months before I actually purchased. It took a long time finding a home because I am so indecisive and I didn't want to make a mistake and buy something I would hate in the future. This caused me to want to see any and everything that was available. Even after I thought I had seen it as I contemplated which house to purchase I couldn't decide. I received a phone call from my realtor a few days after all the showings available to me were over and she communicated to me that there was one brand new listing that we had not seen. This turned out to be the one. It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home. I was in love with the house and put in an offer immediately. My offer was accepted and sometime later I moved in and have been loving life ever since. I don't want to live anywhere else. Although this was a daunting task, I wouldn't change how it all played out.",3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2KI8LLA,3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2KI8LLA,0.0

He became ill and days later got admitted into the hospital.  The end of the day when he got admitted, he passed away and my partner was coming back home.  I was with the cousin’s girlfriend as everything happened and I felt completely heartbroken for everyone. the mourning process was long.  It took a day for me to process exactly what had happened.   I felt like it was my duty to be strong for everyone but it was so difficult. My partner has been very sad and I keep trying to have him remain positive. I am constantly thinking about the kids and the family. I am putting everyone else as a priority just to make sure everyone is ok.  We have had a a couple of rough nights and days as we are coping with the loss. We are still to this day trying to understand and accept what had happened. I know as time passes things will get t better. Little by little the acceptance will sink in.  I hope it is a lesson for everyone to maintain good health and peace among the family. And everyone will hopefully remember how much of a happy person he was no matter what was going on.",3RXCAC0YISBUB1BTCJ17FYSOCQV8GZ,,0.0

This all happened around 5 months ago but I am still so touched by what he did. A few days before my birthday my old car died. It just stopped working. It was pretty old, but I expected to be able to use it for a few more months at least. The car had other plans, though. The transmission blew. The mechanic told me it would cost more than the car was worth to fix it. I was devastated. I needed a car to get back and forth from work. I also had just started a night class at the Community College. I felt like I had lost everything when the car died. After a few days of dealing with getting rides everywhere it was my birthday. My husband knew how sad I was but he wanted me to have a nice day, so I pretended to be over the car nonsense. We went out to dinner somewhere nice and then we went home. I changed into my pajamas and settled in on the couch to watch our shows. Suddenly my husband ran down the stairs and grabbed my hands. He pulled me off the couch and towards the front door. I remember being so annoyed, I wanted to watch television and be left alone. He swung the door open and there it was. A new car! He had somehow managed to get me a car. It even had one of those giant red bows on it. It was the sweetest thing in the whole world. I am so lucky to have him.",,3RXCAC0YISBUB1BTCJ17FYSODM8G8D,0.0

It's been a tough couple of years as I seen my Father-in-Law struggle with his breathing. He was diagnosis with pulmonary lung disease back 2018 but probably had this disease long before that time.  He was a vibrant man considering his age of being 80.  He lived on a farm raising cattle and always took care of his chores until he no longer could. My husband and brother-in-law had to take over the family farm. Eventually the situation started taking a hold on the families since we all lived an hour away. His prognosis wasn't good but he kept persevering until he could no longer take care of himself or the farm. He did not want to go into a home so we called hospice and they helped a couple times a week with the rest of us helping the other days. Towards the end my Father-in-Law had to use an oxygen tank. I noticed every time I seen him he kept loosing weight. He had so much fluid on his lungs that he was no longer hungry. He was wasting away to nothing. We finally had hospice bring a bed into his house and place it in the living room. He no longer had energy to walk to his bedroom. I knew the end was near. We took turns with staying over night at his house as he was now in need of 24 hour care. The night that me and my husband were staying with him he wanted us to say a prayer together.  After that he said he loved us and was really tired. We told him we loved him and to get some rest.  At about 1 in the morning we heard a noise and we both got up. We went to the living room to see my Father-in-Law coughing, chocking, and having a hard time breathing.  He eventually fell back to sleep.  A couple hours went by and we both woke to my Father-in-Law letting out a gurgle. We both held his hand and he eventually passed away.",,3RXPCZQMQQXC01R8DYSS0O5GAXN1G8,0.0

She was determined to start her own lipgloss line. At first, I was a bit skeptical, since she had been prone to picking up hobbies and tossing them aside quite often throughout her youth. However, I quickly realized that she had put a considerable amount of thought into this and was surprisingly passionate about it. I was quite happy for her to say the least and was myself determined to help her in any way that I could. The primary aspects she wanted help with were the packaging and the pricing for her products. I was pleased to find that she was so deep into the process of creating this lipgloss line. Of course, I thought these were great ideas to start with. To start, we went to a nearby crafts and art supplies store and decided to spend much of the day browsing the extensive collection for what would work best. She already had her mind set on packaging that was bold and memorable. We looked first at the most striking colors and materials we could find. To my surprise, she was immediately taken by a combination of colors and materials, as though she had fully established in her mind the design she'd be going for. We selected our packaging supplies and were thrilled we had made it so far so efficiently. We then thought extensively about pricing. She had several ideas and was confident that they would work. I searched online for similar pricing models for makeup and lipgloss lines and quickly found that my daughter's ideas were in line with the common pricing trends. The whole day proved to be a success and I love that my daughter has finally found an aspect of her life she can be fully involved in and passionate about. It warms my heart.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JNAND1Q,0.0

One of the intentions that I set for myself is to be able to support my children in living in their truth. My daughter recently has begin to find herself and she's developing he own style and figuring out what she likes. She struggles academically but she is very artistic. As mother's we want the best for our children and for some reason we tend to think that that means that they have to go to college and we try to keep them in a box. So I set the intention of allowing my children to create their own reality, and about a month ago she came to be and said that she wants me to help start her own business. I felt excited and honored. I never thought that we would get to this point. I got pregnant when i was 15 and our relationship has been rocky every since. I think that not having a relationship with her dad has contributed to the problems that she has had over the years, but I think that she is finally finding herself and creating and identity for herself. I think that this lip gloss line that she wants to create will further help her with her self actualization and I look forward to being apart of it. When the time comes I want her to leave the nest knowing who she is, what she wants, and how to get it. I may not have been emotionally available to her during the majority of her childhood because of my own issues but I can make sure that she gets what she needs for the rest of her childhood. I want to make sure that she feels purposeful. This has definitely been a fulfilling day.",,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JNAND1Q,0.0

He is very excited about the pregnancy too, as he is an only child. Although he was hoping for a boy, and we found out we're having a girl. Either way though, it's a blessing.

I have a son who just turned 12, and since I'm in my 30's I figured I was done. I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA. So the timing is a little hectic. I always had planned on having another after my son, but when it didn't happen in a few years I started to make other plans. I have been a single mother for years and felt no need to settle, so I was planning on adopting in the next few years. I've also worked very hard on my fitness the past 2 years, and this plan felt perfect so I wouldn't have to give up the progress on my body. About 6 months ago I started dating a coworker, who is a great man. I'd even told him not to expect me to have kids if he wanted to be with me. Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant. At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy. After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though. It's been a huge adjustment, however. I went from living alone to having my boyfriend move in to help with my bills. Being an only child, my personal space is very important to me. I understand some sacrifices are necessary though, and in the end it will definitely be worth it.",3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,0.0

I had to do everything on my own, so I wouldn't scare my family. I had to make many severe lifestyle changes, hold everything together, and slowly heal myself. The consequence of my illness is sudden, unexpected anaphylaxis. Every day, I  never know when a life-threatening attack could happen. I live minute-by-minute every day. When you have a disability, the ""little things"" no longer matter. There are too many ""big things"" now taking their place. ""Ablest"" problems are so minor. I felt like I needed a frame of reference for what really matters in life. So I took a few mental notes from the experience. I've limited my social interactions and reached out to more positive people/friends. I think it's important to practice self-care, and this time I'm putting myself first. I found a new therapist who's helping me work on my mental health, and how to cope with the future I am now facing. She helped me explain to my parents what my diagnosis really meant, and assure them I will probably be OK. Fortunately, several good things happened. I bought and renovated a home, trained a service dog, published my first book and started feeling more like a normal (healthy) person again. I have a very savvy medical team and my illness is well-managed. My family are supportive about treatment options and care. I stepped right back into life during a time when I knew I could die at any moment. I did things I used to be afraid of doing. I still actively avoid death daily, but I'm very proud of how I handled everything, and what I have accomplished this year.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR0S6D8A,,0.0

My crappy refrigerator finally kicked the bucket. Even worse, I have no money to get a new one. I went and checked out one I saw on Craigslist, but I'm pretty sure something was growing in it. Too bad my credit sucks. I went and applied for a Lowe's Card and got denied, story of my life. As if it wasn't bad enough, my girlfriend started arguing with me about it. I didn't think it was very mature to call me names because of something I don't seem to have any control over. She hasn't tried to get a new one. I'm not really sure why this is only my problem. It looks like I'm just going to have to get fat eating fast food for awhile until I save up enough money to get one. Maybe I should giver her an ultimatum. I shouldn't have to deal with this myself. It should be both of our problems. I just hope some family and friends have some odd jobs I can do to speed up the process.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FQD85,0.0

Since I was really bored myself, I invited him out to the bar and said I'd pay for a couple of pitchers for us - an offer no man refuses. As usual, his girlfriend got really mad about it and started harping at him over it. We went anyway; I came back with a bit of a buzz, he came back more drunk than before. His girlfriend was waiting at my place, and they started arguing again. At this point, I started to feel a little guilty for directly influencing the actions that led to their bickering, but at the same time I felt she was being a little dramatic because it wasn't that big of a deal to go out, have a couple of drinks and come back. Then me and my friend decided to hang out longer, and we drove over to his place. We got bored and went out to the bar again, and by the end of the night we were really wasted. On our way back we were being loud and belligerent, urinating all over the street and shouting out statements of ignorance for the world to hear. By the time we got back, his girlfriend calmed down and was in a more cheerful mood... but that didn't last long. Over the course of this drunken adventure, a catchphrase was born: ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" It is a loud expression of joy and excitement, and sounds identical to Joe Rogan's joke involving Ludacris. Well, it didn't take long for ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" to get on his girlfriend's nerves - and after repeatedly telling him to ""shut the f*** up"", she got frustrated and clocked him in the jaw. Suddenly, the mood in the room started to become tense - and of course, my friend and I, being the people that we are, tried to deescalate the tension by shouting ""OoOoO oOoOo!"", but his girlfriend was not having any of it. She proceeded to punch him again. I knew it wasn't going to end well, because my friend is not the type of person to let something like that slide once, let alone twice. She got clocked back this time, got really mad and tried to fight him. Obviously there is a huge size and strength disadvantage for her, so I intervened and broke it up - almost becoming the target of my friend's fury in the process because instead of leaving she tried to use the fact I was restraining him to her advantage. Eventually she left, we went back to having a good time, but then later she decided to come back, being the sophisticated, intelligent university graduate that she is. She ruined our good time again, and my friend tried to peel off in her car. The moment he tried to do that, by some stroke of chance an undercover police cruiser was driving by and heard his girlfriend yell ""pull him over!"" Somehow after an hour of going back and forth with the half dozen or so cops that showed up, he managed to avoid arrest. She ended up leaving, and we ended up with quite a story to remember. They broke up about a month later, which gives validity to ""bros before hoes"". ""OoOoO oOoOo!"" lives on, even to this day.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRBBGD8X,0.0

I got dressed and grabbed my cap and gown, then headed to the venue. I was sitting in my seat waiting for my name to be called. I turned around to find my family in the bleaches. I waved when I finally saw them. Then I heard my name and headed for the stage. As I reached the top step, I came crashing down on my face. I knew I shouldn't have worn my heels that day.

The rain started out as a drizzle at first but eventually turned into a raging downpour. I remembered the weather said it would be storming today but I didn't realize how bad it was going to get. I turned on the radio and set the channel to the local news station hoping to get some info about the forecast. As much as I was focused on keeping my car on the road during this monsoon, I still had an appointment to get to and at this time I was starting to run late. I got onto 95 North and started picking up speed. The rain was seriously coming down now and I could barely see out of the windshield. Up ahead there were a few cars travelling about the same speed as me on this four lane stretch of the highway. My windshield wipers were trashing from side to side violently as I did my best to stay in lane. Out of nowhere I saw a white sedan that had been cruising in the slow lane start to drift over across the lane next to it. It turned sideways and shot across the highway, slamming directly into the black SUV that was about fifty feet or so in front of me. I slammed the breaks and felt the ABS kick in but it didn't do much to stop me. Both of the cars came together with a loud bang and collided with the jersey wall on the left side of the road. I must have come within about 10 feet of hitting these two cars as they were drifting across the highway. I passed the wreckage and looked in the rear view mirror as the cars came to a rest blocking three of the four lanes. I didn't stop and just kept on driving.

The wedding happened last year in October. It was an amazing night that impacted our lives forever because of all of the powerful moments that happened. It was a really hectic and crazy build up the months before the wedding. My Dad recently got diagnosed with heart failure in the recent months before the wedding around august. He got very sick and was bedridden and unable to really move, function or eat. It was a rough time for my family because we didn't think he would be able to walk down the isle for my sisters wedding. It was a miracle that in the building weeks before the wedding he was able to start getting to move again. My whole family went to the beach and pushed my dad in a wheel chair to see the sunset. When we got to the end of the pier I think he really appreciated the world and what it still has to offer him. That's when he got up and got motivated to try and make it down the isle for my sisters wedding. the following weeks he started exercising daily. We started slowly walking around my neighborhood to get him moving again. Before we new it he started lifting weights and jogging. It was an amazing process to see him get stronger over time. It was an absolute miracle that he is now healthy, and was able to take my sisters arm and walk her down the isle. It was one of my most memorable moments seeing them make it down together.",3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR6MX4L8,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR6MX4L8,0.0

I had no idea that I was going to be thrown this party and I had no idea who was going to be there. The party was thrown by my Aunt with the help of two of my close friends. I usually don't like surprises and this is well known among my friends and family. Despite not liking surprises the perfect planning and inclusion of the correct people made the night a real success. I was really touched by the fact that people were willing to do so much for me. I didn't realize how special of a gesture it was to plan a party for someone without their input. The most memorable part of the evening was when I came up to the balcony and saw all of my friends. I knew they were going to be afraid of my reaction, but I think I was able to act happy enough to convince them I wanted the party. This was also very significant to me because it was a birthday that I was planning on doing nothing for. If my friends asked me to have a party before this event I would definitely have turned down the idea. Another thing that made the even very special were the choices of food and drinks. My friends chose to have Mexican food, and also chose to drink tequila. Mexican food is my favorite type of food and I love when it is paired with Tequila. I think the choices of food and the choices of guests are what made the night so successful.",,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHRIYL4LW,0.0

He has been to so many doctors, and none of them have been able to help him. They just refer him to another specialist after they see their treatment does not help him. He has had injections, X-rays, MRI's, CT scans, bone density scans, nerve conduction tests, blood work to where it is amazing he has not passed out from the amount taken from him at times. The last doctor we say was a rheumatologist, and he has referred my husband to a hematologist/oncologist. Knowing that this might be a type of blood cancer has us extremely worried and concerned. We want answers, but this one is definitely a scary one to have to go see. Knowing that it might be cancer is scary. We are trusting God though for a good report.

It was my first time ever being to the nation's capital, and with one day before my husband's surgery, we attempted to walk all over downtown DC and see as many monuments as possible before we had to be back at Walter Reed and ready for surgery the next morning. We traveled downtown on the Metro, and ended up getting off a short distance from the Capital, where we started. We then saw the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial (my main reason for wanting to go downtown!), the World War 2 Memorial, the Korean Memorial, and Vietnam Memorial. We then took the metro back to Walter Reed, where we were staying on base for the next couple of weeks. Side note, I was really impressed by the strategic placing of water vendors throughout the different monuments, with water, Gatorade, popsicles, etc. I don't know if it's a good use of their life, but we really appreciated them being there! The thing that stood out to me about the monuments was the realization that the Lincoln Memorial literally just had Lincoln's statue in it. I seriously thought that there might be more, maybe a museum commemorating his achievements or something, but it really had just his statue. I might have been a little disappointed, but still impressed at the imposing presence Lincoln was, even if just carved in stone. What also stuck out to me while we were downtown was the World War 2 Memorial. I honestly didn't expect to be impressed by that memorial. But the different quotes placed around the structure really helped the memorial pop in my mind. I enjoy reading, and reading wisdom from those gone before us, who went through such a horrific time. So, I appreciated that monument more than I expected to. I'm really glad I was able to get the chance to see a small part of our Capital even though our reason for being there wasn't necessarily ideal.",3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEDBZDTI,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEDBZDTI,0.0

This turned out to be an adventure in itself which we eventually got the streamers together. The most surprising event of the story was how each person turned out to be a streamer. After this day, the streamers met up again and had a day out, which we all were involved in as viewers who participated in chat. The adventure continued in which the new group of friends explored the city which involved going to different restaurants, bars and even landmarks. As the day continued, things got more intense as more people joined. Each of the people involved had different personalities and so it was fun to see how the introverted people interacted with the extroverted people. The extroverted people interacted a lot with the public. I, as a viewer in chat commented in chat towards the streamer that I was watching, how crazy things were. The streamer that I was watching echoed the sentiment by saying that he was out of his element, however he was having a lot of fun. The reactions of the public were also interesting as the streamers were meeting new people who had all kinds of different professions. Two notable people were doctors and one of them was from Korea. All in all, we had a great time in which I was a viewer and commentator, felt that I was on an adventure with them due to the interaction via chatroom.",,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEPOYTDZ,0.0

Our group consisted of my wife and toddler daughter, my sister and her husband, my niece and her husband, and my nephew. Our first flight went to Portland, where we had breakfast. We finally made it to Burbank. I rented a Suburban for most of us to ride in, and my dad also met us at the airport to take the rest of the group. On night one we went to a local Mexican restaurant, that was very authentic and had a mariachi band. The next day we went to the beach during the day. We traveled down to Dana point. It was a nice sunny day. My daughter had never been to the ocean before. She was scared at first but then was very excited to be at the beach. My step mom provided a light dinner for everyone that evening. On the next day we went to the Huntington gardens and explored gardens from all over the world. This day it was cold in rainy, which was very surprising for a day in late in May in the Los Angeles area. That evening we went to the Panda Inn for my dads birthday dinner. I went to this restaurant many times when I was in High School, including for my High School graduation celebration. We wall enjoyed different dishes as we ordered family style. We gave my dad his birthday gifts. After dinner we went back to their house and watched a video my dad had put together that had pictures from our childhood.

I wasn't even born when he died.  He died over 30 years ago and, but I am disturbed with what I have learned.  He was my mom's little brother and she adored him.  She still cries when she thinks about him and his death.  He was sick with a high fever but my grandfather refused to let a doctor care for him.  He thought the illness would run its course and Jack would be fine.  Well, Jack died at the young age of 15 years old.  My grandmother was racked with guilt about not being able to get her son medical help because of her husband.  She finally told Mom about it last night.  The family is stunned but also feels terrible that my grandma has carried this around with her for so many years.  Mom is okay, I guess.  I think she is very sad and wonders the, ""what ifs,"" but you can't linger on that.  We have to support and nurture Grandma right now and let her know no one blames her.  I so feel for her and want her to be relieved of the pain she is in and has been all these years.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE5UNAX9,0.0

Fast forward to September, we intended to make a visit to my 88 year old grandmother but did make the trip yet.  We finally felt it was the right time to introduce her to our son.  I called up my grandma on the phone and asked if she would be open to us stopping by on Saturday.  She said that would be great and would love to have us.  So, we got up early around so we could be on the road by 8 am for the 2 to 2-1/2 hour drive.  I told my grandmother we would arrive between 10-10:30 am.  We made it exactly to her house at 10:30 am, which my grandma mentioned ""when you say you will be her at 10:30 am you meant it.""  I thought that was cute because I know she was anticipating the visit so much.  When we arrived you could tell her face lite up.  It had been at least a year since I saw my grandma and I felt guilty.  I feel like I could visit more often and call.  It is hard to find time between work and having a new born but none the less I feel like I can do better.  Anyways we sat down with here and she had many questions about our baby.  We also asked if she would like to hold him and she was hesitant.  She said she didn't want to drop him, but she said yes anyways.  We took some cute pictures of both of them together.  After we visited for about an hour, she asked if we would like lunch.  We said no thank you, trying to be polite.  But she didn't take no for an answer.  She started to set the table with bowls.  I was confused at the moment on what she was planning on serving for lunch.  As I watched she went to the refrigerator and grabbed a gallon of ice cream out of the freezer.  She asked for help from my wife to scoop the ice cream since it was frozen.  We had ice cream, potato chips, cookies and grapes for lunch.  Then we left shortly after.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYEHN6AXQ,0.0

A romantic getaway to the Bahamas was just the ticket.  When we arrived in the Bahamas, though, much to our surprise, our luggage was not at the airport.  We waited and waited, eager for our vacation to begin, but our bags never showed up.  Eventually the conveyor belt was empty, without our bags.  We went to the customer service desk, and they told us our bags had been taken to Chicago instead.  Everything was in those bags...clothes, toothbrushes, etc.   We had nothing! We were told our bags would arrive in two days, so we unfortunately spent our first night of vacation going shopping for necessities to hold us over until our bags arrived.  What was even worse was I had an engagement ring in my suitcase.  I was planning to propose to my girlfriend over dinner at this ritzy restaurant on the island the next night.  Needless to say...it was not the start to my birthday vacation that I was hoping for.  Four months later, we are now engaged.  It didn't happen at the restaurant that second night as I had hoped, but I was able to do it on our last night there because our suitcases DID eventually arrive.  I took her for a walk on the beach and proposed there in the moonlight, which was equally great.  So it all worked out.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYEXX4XAB,0.0

I had no plans and wasn't really expecting to do anything for my birthday other than what I normally do on an average day. To my surprise, on the day of my birthday, I woke up to a birthday card from my parents that included two tickets of a flight to the Bahamas that was departing in six hours and a note that we have reservations at a hotel for the week. I immediately went to thank my parents and then called my girlfriend to tell her the news. I wanted her to come with me, she was extremely surprised and excited too. We only had about five hours to get ready, pack, and make it to the airport. We were going to the Bahamas for a week! About two hours until the flight departures, there is a knock at our door. We answer it and it's a limo driver! My parents even surprised us with a limo that would take us to the airport. We couldn't believe it! We go to the airport in the limo and get on the flight. We arrive in the Bahamas and we were brought to our hotel. The hotel room was a suite and it was just absolutely gorgeous, it had an ocean and pool view too. The pool area even had some big slides that made it like a water park. We didn't get to do much the first day because we were traveling but we did go out for a very nice dinner at a restaurant that was on the beach and I think I had the best seafood I've ever had there. We also sat on the beach and listened to the waves afterwards and went in the hot tub for a little bit before we went to sleep. This was definitely the most shocking and exciting day of my life and I'll always remember it.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYEXX4XAB,0.0

It was surprising since the last few days were in the upper 70s.  The start of that morning was rough. I had to wake up around 5am to get ready for a day that didn't have sunrise yet. The whole day was filled with delays and problems due to the cold temperature. The snow came rolling down the mountains only after I waited an extra ten minutes for my usual bus. The bus lost traction en route to my work and slide across four lanes of traffic, and I didn't wear enough layer to stop the cold. On my way home, I remembered I had a fireplace and some wood I had been saving for just an occasion like this. I made myself some hot soup and pulled down and old blanket before starting a fire. Only after lighting the kindling, I realized my dog never experienced one before. For the first hour, she ran away from it, but quickly changed interest by the warmth.  The two of us cuddle as I ate and watched the fire. After a long day, I really enjoyed the warmth of the fire, the soft crackles as the wood turned to ash, and the mellowness my restless dog found in the the fireplace. It was a good way to end a hectic day. I enjoyed it a lot.",,3SB5N7Y3O4QCTC6QHFOSMJM65780GZ,0.0

I'm really glad that they turned out well, when we surprised Lily she made the most perfect shocked faces. The pictures will be great for their wedding invites. All in all, I'm really proud of how it all came together. Finding tickets for all of our college friends to fly out to Miami was pretty difficult, but at the last minute it all fell into place. We found the perfect beach with a beautiful sunset, and I brought my fancy camera. The hardest part was the actual surprise. Lily always feels the need to be on top of everything, so we were worried she would be suspicious and figure out our planning. Brent and I decided that I would ask her to go on a sunset walk with me and he would pretend he was meeting up with a buddy at a restaurant. We had it all set up that he was about a mile down the beach from where Lily and I started walking. Many times I got nervous because Lily said she wanted to turn around and not walk all the way down the beach, so I had to keep convincing her to go on. At the end of the beach, Brent and I had laid out little tea candles in mason jars and various flower petals. When Lily and I finally reached the end it was so lovely, she was confused as soon as she saw the whole scene and Brent waiting there in a suit. Our sorority sisters were all patiently trying to hide behind some bushes and dunes. After Brent finally popped the question they all jumped out and screamed it was really funny. Lily was so surprised to see Sydney and Laura. I would be lying if I said we didn't all get a little weepy and emotional. I'm really happy it went according to plan.",,3SBEHTYCWOPNMY86FBZ4ZNT6N19IY3,0.0

He hasn't mentioned the other school in neither a positive or negative way. I think in his mind it almost doesn't exist. He's completely forgotten there was even a chance of him transferring! He enjoys his current teacher very much and is excelling academically. He has made new friends, and kept some of the few who were in his kindergarten class last year. The others he is able to see and play with at recess. I know he wouldn't be able to see his old friends had I decided to initiate the transfer. I'm glad I didn't go through with that. My son has drawn a few more pictures about his happy family, too. I care more about his emotional well-being than anything else (right up there with his physical health), so knowing how he is feeling comforts me. He just started back from Fall Break this morning. I am excited to see how he is when he returns home here in a few hours. I know at the end of the year I'll have to make the same decision again.

I first met GW when I went to work for my uncle at his business after I graduated from college. GW was my uncle's neighbor and he worked part time there. GW didn't talk a lot but he had a wicked sense of humor. He and his wife, AW, raised 4 kids together in the same house for 50 years. I didn't get to see GW often after I got a new job and moved but I heard for AW that GW wasn't feeling so well since last year. He was in and out of hospital a lot of the time. Then in March I got a call from AW that GW was in the hospital again and would like to see me and my uncle. I got the feeling that this might be the last time we will speak to each other again. This might be the goodbye the we all dreaded. On a beautiful Saturday I drove my uncle and my aunt to visit GW at the hospital. On the way there we bought him some flowers for the room. When we got there I could hardly recognize GW. He looked so thin and frail and his cheeks sunk in quite a bit. I felt so sad that some tears actually came out. GW was asleep so we asked a nurse to wake him. He was groggy but very happy to see us. Even though he was physically deteriorating I could see that his mind was as sharp as even and his sense of humor was still there. I stuck my hand out to shake his hand and he held mine for a long time like he didn't want to let go. His hand felt cold and weak. I got emotional again and almost cried again but I held it in. I didn't want GW to worry so I put on a brave face and smiled. Before we left I told GW to get better soon and we'll be waiting for him at home. For the rest of the day I felt a bit melancholy and down. Seeing GW like that reminded me of how fleeting and fragile life is and it scared me.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPFO1AZC,,0.0

Everyone has something that is a challenge, for me it is having divorced parents with very strong and very different world views. My Mom always accepted me, but my Dad never did. We have tried on and off for years to reconnect. It never seems to keep us talking. So we are ALWAYS KIND OF ESTRANGED, but Dad and I had totally stopped trying a while ago, and then my Step-Mom wanted to give me some furniture last Spring and they came out to see us last April. I was really eager to play guitar for my Dad, and his response was pretty meh.     The surprising thing that happened was my son's visit. My oldest later went to visit my Dad and learned that my Dad wanted to learn to finger pick  after hearing me play, which is high praise coming from my old man. And for a while I felt better because it felt like approval. But since  then, only silence from my Dad. No emails to me or my other 5 kids. My Step-Mom remembers their Birthdays, and even signs cards fro my Dad.       So a few months later I am feeling like I remember more from my childhood, when my Dad was a happier more loving guy, and I felt loved. It hurts more now though, like I had a nearly healed sunburn and that encouraged me to go out and lie in the sun, and now it's almost a medical condition and really stings.     Like hope is dangerous, and acceptance is key.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN4ZA3,,0.0

Although we visit several kinds of places such as Senior Citizens Daycare Centers, Schools for Disabled Children and Assisted- Living Homes, our favorite place to visit is Shriners Children Hospital.  When Sheriff and I do our weekly visit we actually put on a program in the hospital's auditorium. It is always amazing to me to see these happy children faces when I know they are battling serious, and sometimes terminal illnesses.  Just being in these children's presence is such a blessing and reminds me to appreciate each day. The program Sheriff and I do is quite interactive with the children, so when someone doesn't participate it is quite noticeable. About 6 months ago I would notice a young girl, probably about 7 years old, standing off to the side. She looked incredibly lonely and sad. I have learned over time to let the kids approach us or Sheriff as they deemed to be comfortable. Each week I would hold eye contact with  her for a little longer and subtly move a little closer to this girl, whose name I later learned is Rebecca.  It took about 4 weeks to get close to Rebecca, and finally one day when we were close I asked her if she would like to pet Sheriff. She approached us in a shy manner and gently put her hand on Sheriff's back. The following week she actually walked up to Sheriff and gave him a big hug. My heart felt so much overwhelmingly love for this girl. As time went on I spoke with Rebecca often and felt we had become close. It was with a heavy heart when I received a phone call from the director who asked is Sheriff and I would visit Rebecca in her room. She had become gravely terminal. It was a day of love but one of extreme sadness as well. Rebecca's mom told me that one of Rebecca's wishes was to see Sheriff. She told me that Sheriff brought so much happiness to Rebecca. That day I knew the power of Therapy Dog and what a difference they make in people's lives.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,,0.0

His name is Sheriff, and him and I have been going to Shriners Hospital for Children once a week for the past year. About 6 months ago when we were there I noticed a young girl about 7 years old. she would stand way in the back  of the auditorium away from the other children. She look so sad, and in turn it made me feel so sad. I've learned that you can't force someone to participate, only encourage. At times I felt disheartned as it seemed we were not making any progress. And I had to remind myself that this was a long term therapy program and she was battling a terminal illness. Over about 4 weeks I would slowly get closer to her with Sheriff. During this time I would make more and more eye contact with her and hold it for longer period of times. Eventually we were about 5 feet in front of her and I could sense her curiousity. So I asked if she would like to pet Sheriff. I still remember her smile and her hesitation as she walked up to her Sheriff. She sowly reached out and touched him then backed away quickly. The next week she came up to him on her own , and the following week she came up to him and hugged him. My heart felt like it would burst. I knew then without a doubt that she would remember this moment, as I would.  Over the course of the next few months we grew close and would talk, as she  relaxed with the help of Sheriff. About a month ago, the director of the program asked if Sheriff and I would come in one day to visit Rebecca in her room. Her illness had taken a turn for the worse and she had a matter of days, if that, to live. It was an extremely sad day and a difficult day. Her mom told me that Rebecca's wish was to spend time with Sheriff as he made her happy. I knew then the power a therapy dog has to heal and warm the heart. I also knew that I would never forget this day , this experience.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,0.0

It was beautiful and sunny outside, so everyone got to have their ice cream on the playground. My kids and I all got strawberry because that's our favorite. I love that I got to spend extra time with my kids and share that special memory with them. Ice cream is always good, it's even better when you have someone you love to share it with. The kids were all so excited and I loved just sitting and watching them run around with smiles on their faces, enjoying a break from their school routine and a refreshing scoop of ice cream as well. My kids and I say under the shade of a tree for almost an hour talking and reading a book together while we ate. We laughed together and talked about what we would do the following weekend. It was very relaxing. Some of the other kids ran around the playground and went on the swings and slides. They all had a great time. Once thing that shocked me was how clean all the kids were by the end of the outing. I was expecting sticky hands and faces and lots of ice cream stained shirts. I even brought wet naps, just in case, but they were all clean as a whistle. The greatest part of the ice cream day was that we raised enough money to fix the ceiling in the school library! I was shocked. I thought it would help us towards our goal, but I never thought we'd actually raise all of it. It was a day I will never forget!",,3SITXWYCNWVOZL4Q45LLUMIKI0RBXV,0.0

Two were at a community college and the other three a university. After all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this, I finally graduated. They held it at the arena on campus, which was massive. There must have been at least 2,000 people in the crowd and at least 600 graduating with me. I didn't think that I would have many people there for me, most said they couldn't make it. That's why it was so surprising to hear so many people cheering me on when I got my diploma. I wasn't expecting it, but a lot of people showed up for me. It was really heartwarming to see. I couldn't help but smile when I walked across the stage. I figured that I would just grab my diploma and quickly walk on before anyone noticed that there were only a few people there for me. After hearing how many there were, though, I took my time and reveled in it a little. After commencement ended, I took some time to talk to my other classmates and wish them luck.

I went alongside ""Mascot"" my Dog, a German Shepard, Mascot was more than just my pet, he understands me perfectly well, and I always love having him around. From swiftly drawing my attention to what happening around as I drove by different cities. Little did I wonder how boring the journey would have been without ""Mascot"", during my voyage I stopped by in a town to get something for myself and Mascot, and as I walked into a mini mart, all attention was just on Mascot. Virtually everyone around appreciated his beauty, from his gallantry stand to his face structure and hairy skin. As I continued my journey I and Mascot were kind of having some conversations, as he had quickly finished what I got for him, he still wanted mine, I couldn't resist seeing him with the look on his face whenever he wants something from me. I didn't know how far I and Mascot had traveled until I got to a place to pee. Then I overheard some guys speaking an Hausa language, then I knew I was already close to the region of my destination. I got inside my truck to continue my journey and as I continued Mascot wouldn't even sleep for a moment. He didn't like the fact that I had to confined him to a sit belt.

Within the 30 minutes time period, I spotted two men working on private well in the yard. One of the men was a bit  older than I, but I kept watching him because he was so handsome! He must have been watching me as well because he walked up to me and introduced himselfas Joe Gardner.  I was so nervous and could  barely answer his questions. He told me a bit about himself and then asked me, ""Would you like to go out with me?""Being only 17 and quite fascinated with him, I answered in the affirmative. The next day he called me and we went to eat and then to a movie.  When he brought mehome, he kissed me and put his large hands around my waist and was impressed that hisfingers actually touched on each side!!  We dated for several months and then one evening, while sitting in the car in front of myhouse, he said, ""How'd you like to marry me?""  Overwhelmed, I  hugged him and said yes! We were not wealthy and had  little money to buy a  wedding dress.  A friend of mine who'd married just a few months before offered to ""loan"" me her  wedding dress.  OnlyI had  to ""rent"" it from her to the tune of $50. 00!!  Nice friend!!We went to my minister and asked him if he would officiate.  He, of course, said yes. Meanwhile, my mother and best friend had set up a bridal shower at the church.  Itwas a big surprise when I walked in and found 25 ladies sitting there, waiting for me. The table was set with lovely flowers and candy dishes full of chocolate candy.  Good for me! I really was blessed with all that I'd need to start a home and kitchen! The wedding was simple.  I wore the borrowed dress and looked like a princess in it!  At leastthat's what my husband said. We took off for a 3 day honeymoon and it took us 5 hours to get to the promised steak househe'd told me about!  They had already closed up but my new husband was hungry and told them we'd just married and he was ""starved.""After leaving the steak house, we found a motel that he could afford.  I  was a bit apprehensivebecause I'd  never slept  with a  man before. When  he went to sleep, I got my pillow  and blanket and slept at the foot of the bed all night! He awoke and came and picked me up and carried me to the bed and I finally slept.",,3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX9X7GK18,0.0

Pete invited me out to Los Angeles, to catch up and get reacquainted.  He's a mid-level manager with a props company that works with studios and producers, and he remembered I love movies.  I love them more now.  I was surprised to find I enjoyed the conversation.  I was even more surprised by the invitation.  He'll put me up out there, room and board for the most part, for a whole month if I want.  All I have to do is pay for my travel.  It's a very tempting offer.  I haven't traveled much, even though I've wanted to.  And I do remember having some good times with Pete back in school.  I'm still thinking the offer over, and told him that much.

We had our plate full with two toddlers already and adding  a third just seem like not the right thing to do. Our family had gone through a lot of family and financial issues and the thought of having another child just didn't seem like the right thing to do for us at the time. After sitting down and talking about it we decided that having another child might not be so bad afterall. It would shed a new light on our household and it would just be something great in the end. So that is what we decided to do. After we talked to our other kids we decided that adoption would be the route to go and then the process started. That was four months ago and now our babygirl is the best thing that has ever happened to us. She gets along well with the other kids and everyone just adores her. She has opened our hearts and filled our household with so much more love and she is truly a blessing. I am thankful for my family and my husband who supported me throughout all of this. I am also glad that we did decide to go through with the adoption which was a quick process. I can see that there is a very bright future ahead of us and I can't wait to explore everything with my little family. I am so happy I have a happy, healthy family and we all love each other very much. If anyone would have told me a long time ago this is how things would have ended I would not have believed them, I have a nice life and that is all that I could ask for.",,3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL6UQLU8,0.0

She's wildly out of my league and I'm not sure how she doesn't see that - beautiful, thoughtful, skilled, intelligent, she paints, she writes, she cooks, she's teaching herself to code - really, she's just absurdly amazing, anyone who met her would be bound to love her. Anyway, we spent the rest of that day chatting and watching a show together. Have to admit we were both a bit distracted during the show.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG015VCKG,3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG015VCKG,0.0

I am not sure what participated this change, likely it was because my son started middle school and his personality has become much more defiant. I'd expected some personality changes as my son moved past elementary school but it's been really beyond the pale. I should have expected worse. Anyway, our relationship reached an all-time low in October as my son flippantly told me that he was going to go to a Halloween party with his friends from school as if he didn't need my permission. I don't know all of these friends and I don't know the parents where the party was going to be hosted. I voiced my concerns to my son. I told him that I had to check first before agreeing to anything. I thought it was a minor and reasonable thing but my son raised his voice and accused me of being controlling. He stormed upstairs to his room and I followed him trying to explain the issue that I have with him being up at all hours with people I don't know. James apparently had enough and he slammed his bedroom door shut, nearly hitting my face in the process. Now, I try to be patient when dealing with my son but this was too much for me. I admit I shouted and my voice was several decibels higher than what it should have been. I shouted at James that avoiding me isn't going to solve the problem and slamming his door just meant that he is going to lose his privacy. I collected myself, went downstairs to the basement, grabbed a screwdriver and hammer, and went back to James' bedroom door. I had his door off its hinges in about 30 seconds. With privacy being one of the most important things to James, this was intolerable to him. He acted as if the world was ending. However, I stood firm and explained that actions have consequences and shutting the door in my face means that he loses his door until he can close it properly. I'd expected this to be a short term, temporary thing, but it seemed to have brought about a change in James. He calmed down over the next few days and we actually had a pleasant dinner for once.  I put the door back on its hinges a few days later and James hasn't slammed his door since. We still have our differences but I think James now knows how to work on them a bit more constructively.",,3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0CI9KC3,0.0

I know that he is legally an adult, I get that he has to become his own person. What I don't get is how can he disrespect in the way he has? He just stood in my yard and called me out of my name. I feel that he has taken everything I have ever done for him and thrown it back in my face. As if I am not good enough, as if I have not done well enough, for him to call me 'Mom'. I can deal with a lot of things. I can support him when he needs help, when he makes mistakes. However, I cannot and will not allow anyone to disrespect me in such a way. It is unacceptable for him to treat me with anything less than respect when he believes he no longer needs me. Does that mean that when he decides he needs something from me, that I will once again be 'Mom'? I am furious that he can do this to me. I am hurt that my baby boy has the ability to basically betray me. That is exactly what he has done. He has betrayed the Mother/Son bond that we have. Now, I have to show him that if he can't respect and appreciate me the way that I deserve, I will not jump at the chance to be his saving grace again.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0CI9KC3,3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0CI9KC3,0.0

It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job. I love being able to spend much more time with my grandchildren and money isn't too tight. I don't have expensive tastes any way. I also enjoy spending time on my hobbies and not having to get up every morning at the same time.",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86YRYYJF,0.0

These are character aspects that I have always struggled with; I always thought I needed to be someone else to enjoy life. But this encounter at the bar has revealed to me that that kind of thinking is poisonous to the mind and does me no good. So, having this encounter was good life lesson for me. This encounter said when me and a group of friends were at our favorite bar enjoying our time off work. During our drinking, a group of people came into the bar that we weren't familiar with, and one of them in that crowd was a beautiful woman that caught my attention. It seems that one of my friends caught me gawking, so to tease me, he got our group riled up have me take a dare to walk up to her and talk to her to get her phone number. I was usually highly resistant towards this goading, but it seems that the alcohol eases my inhibitions enough for me to take them on their dare. So, with a sense of confidence I rarely possess, I walked up to this woman and started talking to her. The conversation started off well enough. She and I were laughing and having a decent time. But, as the conversation went on, I found it harder and harder to convince her of the persona I initially presented to her. She picked up on that as well. He demeanor towards me went from pleasant to annoyed quickly. Eventually, she just said that I should go if All I did was lie to her. I was embarrassed and disappointed in myself, I started walking away. But something in me snapped. I turned around and when back to her. I told her who I really was and what I am really about. She appreciated that and agreed to let me continue to talk to her.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4QQXTKH,,0.0

The most suprising thing to me was the fact that it happened and the emotions I felt. It is unreal when something so painful happens, that you think will never happen. I also never knew the strength of negative emotions I could feel. I thought I knew pain before, but I was never remotely close to feeling real pain. There were many sleepless nights spent crying, and feeling like I was just going to fall over and die. The extreme anxiety and panic attacks I experienced were terrible. I look back wondering how I made it through. After surviving the worst time period of my life I learned that I can take something awful and get some good form it. I think the only way to survive something so bad it to find a way to see something good come from it. I am able to help others, and connect with other bereaved parents who have helped me survive. I can be that person who saves someone from going down the wrong path to handle grief. There have been a couple people who were here for me in that way. That is the best way to handle a bad situation. You have to find something positive to take from it, and use it in a good way.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4XKVKT1,,0.0

If only I had treated her condition with the same sense of urgency a few hours ago, maybe this all could have been avoided. I blame myself a lot for what happened. And the timing of it all, as sick is it may seem, just makes me feel that she was trying to get back at me for something. Maybe for following all of the rules. For going to school. Getting a good job. Listening to our parents. Maybe in her state of mind she wasn't quite thinking so far ahead, but as fate would have it, I was the one who got to witness her lifeless corpse hanging from the ceiling by a telephone cord, the blood dripping down her ankles. I let out a scream. I felt like I was in a movie. And there was nothing that could have been done. Every year in May we gather together and reflect on her life. What we could have done differently.

I had worked as a server in a nice family restaurant for thirteen years, after owning my own business for twenty years and retiring to go RVing.  I never thought of my serving job as really hard work, because I enjoyed the people I worked with, enjoyed the customers, was proud of the product I sold, and in general had a good time working about 25 hours per week. I retired for the second time because I am just too darned old to carry heavy trays and do my share of the cleaning and side work which each employee is expected to finish each day as part of their job. I was really touched and surprised when, on my last day of work all my coworkers gave me a small party, with gifts and cake.  My manager gave me a gift certificate for Whole Foods, and another supervisor bought me a B-B gun to scare rabbits out of my garden.  About two years before retiring I bought some land outside of town and decided to try some sustainable farming techniques and permaculture experiments.  I sold my RV and put a small home om the land.  I planned to build a greenhouse right after retirement, but I got sick and could not really do anything on my farm for two months.  I was really depressed and was about to give up.  Then one morning I got a phone call from a co-worker and friend, asking if I was going to be home that day. About an hour after the call, I looked out my front window to see a caravan of pickups and cars coming down my road.  I walked out the door to see over half my co-workers unloading building suppiles from their trucks, and picnnic supplies with a barbeque grill from various SUVs and cars.  Over the next three days every single worker in the restaurant spent hours in their off time to build me a beautiful greenhouse, a carport and a fenced in area for a garden. I never knew that friends like this existed.  I hope I have helped out when needed.  I hope I have done my share to assist my co-workers when they needed help.  But I never expected the support and help I got from these wonderful friends, and hope I can someday pay it forward.",3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY161QH9RN,3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY161QH9RN,0.0

It was everything i had hoped for. A beautiful, gentle start for our baby. I felt such overwhelming waves of love. Everything felt perfect and wonderful.

I was so, so excited to finally be in a classroom for almost real, to actually interact with students and have them look at me as a teacher. I had so many ideas to put into action. It feels like my future is gone in a wink. I mean, I knew this was coming. The budget hasn't been adding up for months now. Years, if I'm honest. And when I didn't get that last scholarship I knew it was over. It's just so impossibly hard now that it's actually the day. It's actually, truly over. Everything I worked for evaporated. Just for dumb reasons too, like my stupid car breaking down at the wrong time, and Rory getting sick...as if things weren't bad enough. At least I had teaching. At least I had my career. Not anymore. I don't know what I'm going to do now. My dad said he could find me a job where he works, but it'll be something awful like a secretary or IT support...not what I wanted. Not even close. I guess this is just life in America these days. Sorry kids. I hope your new, richer teacher cares about you as much as I would have.",,3TAYZSBPLMUMFRIVR2MNULYOFVJ2SL,0.0

It was about time, but it wasn't anything I had planned for. I have been driving a 2012 hyundai elantra for about 5 years now and have amassed about 200,000 miles on it. The starter was beginning to act funny, and I knew I would need to do something soon, but I really wasn't prepared for this. It was my wife's idea. She's always the one that wants to spend the money in our house. The last one to work for it (she hasn't held a job in the nearly 5 years we've been married) and the first one to want to spend. What's ironic is that the day before, we had gotten into a humongous argument over, what else? Money. It's always the issue around here. But with that being said, it was a horrible idea to go looking at cars that day. We had made up from our argument, and of course I wanted to avoid upsetting her again. We ended up walking out of there with a 2018 hyundai sonata. Now it's a beautiful car by anyone's standards, the problem is it's about 200 dollars more than what we were paying off on our old car, and I still have about $8k left before I even pay that off. We had decided we would let that car get repo'd and just enjoy our new car. We'd make some simple lifestyle changes to cover the difference. We'd start eating food at home more, and my wife would stop drinking. One of those things happened. Want to guess what it is? I don't know if I can keep going on like this. She still refuses to get a job to help cover the costs. I just want her to do something. For all I care she can work part time on amazon like I do after coming home from my FULL TIME JOB! But alas, anything is too much effort for her, and here I sit and type, because the $3.52 is going to changing the oil in this new car that I can hardly afford.",3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9JJQ0DM,,0.0

I had no weakness 5 months ago. I was a successful construction worker, a drywall hanger to be more specific.  I have 3 children and a wife and I was the primary breadwinner. If you don't know much about drywall one thing that is important is the weight involved. Each sheet of 12 foot by 4 foot drywall is 70 pounds. If we are talking about 5/8 drywall the weight is 120 pounds. I lifted anywhere from 40 to 60 of these sheets everyday for 15 years. All my joints were wearing down slowly particular my neck. I enjoyed my job, but it was labor intensive and hard on my body, but I was young. This all changed 5 months ago with a injury.         One day while lifting a sheet, I felt tremendous pain that brought me to my knees. I rushed to the hospital where they did a ct scan on my abdominal cavity. I was diagnosed with a ventral hernia. I could not go back to work, I had a family to take care of and I could barely get out of bed. While I was stuck in bed my muscles were shrinking which cause a whole host of problems from pain to speech problems. I could not even speak to my children without feeling pain. I had find something to do for income, I just started selling on amazon and mturk surveys. I would like to tell you I am passed all this now, but I am still going through it and I'm yerrified everyday.",,3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9SD4D0A,0.0

It has been a hard, last 6 months! I had to work extremely hard the last little while to keep my grades up, especially when my father passed away. I almost fell into a deep depression but with the help of my friends and family, I was able to pull out of it. The visit from my mother made all the difference in the world. I can see the strength, hope and courage she displays and her encouragement to me during this time -when she is hurting so much herself- really has helped me turn a corner in my grief. She has helped me understand that my father is not truly gone, he will always be here in our memories. So, I started today with a fresher, happier outlook, and I believe I received divine confirmation that everything will be ok, by several things that happened today. I was walking from my dorm to my first class and something caused me to look up. It was a beautiful day and not a cloud in the sky, but I plainly saw not one, but two rainbows! And the were just as clear as day! And that wasn't the end of it either -as today progressed, other things happened! I found seven pennies after my fifth class! My dad's birthday was the seventh of May! Then, after it got dark this evening, something caught my eye out the window. I looked and saw three shooting stars right in a row! Three was my dad's favorite number! Now I know, my dad is not really gone and he will be here by my side even though I can't see him, and everything is going to be alright. I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of my family next week for my graduation ceremony!",,3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDG4YEMM1,0.0

Thankfully, from what I understand and my parents explained to me that night after returning home, it's in the early stages. There's a good possibility she could survive. That makes me happy. I don't know what I would do without her. They told me and my siblings that she would be starting chemotherapy, whatever that is, in about a week.

I was stuck in the midwest for most of my life. Growing up in Ames, Iowa, there wasnt a lot of career paths for me. I went to college locally and got an engineering degree, but was expected to go into agriculture. My whole family is farmers and manual work, so getting a fancy degree always had some sneers and jeers. I started working, predictably, at a farming co-op designing feed bags, but wasnt something I was really passionate about. Then about 4 months ago I got an offer from a company I applied with quite some time before. They wanted to call me and do a phone interview and I quickly agreed. They were looking for someone to test concrete density and wear and tear at the higher altitudes to see if they could make better roads up in the mountains. They were impressed with the initial call and offered to fly me out in person. I wasn't going to say no to a free vacation so i got on a plane and went to the meeting. The project lead was so impressed with the interview that he tentatively offered me a job on the spot. I still had to clear HR, but that went over smoothly. A few weeks later I got a relocation bonus check contingent on me starting and staying with the company for a year. I packed up most of my things in a Uhual and drove out to Colorado. Its beautiful here and I couldnt be happier with the way the job has turned out. I am living the dream I always had to get out of the corn fields of Iowa!",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11EC8VN8W0,0.0

He was always good to me growing up, so I didn't think it would be that bad. When we first moved in, it was hard for him to adjust. He was very stressed out about it all the time, being used to just him in the house alone all the time. We had a few fights about who does the dishes and who does laundry when, but those were just hiccups in our story here. My daughter did, however, step on my father's cat, and that was hard to get over. The cat was fine, but he is my Dad's best friend, so it was tough. He yelled at my daughter -- moreso because he was afraid for the cat, but it still shocked her and me. Since then, we have all adjusted pretty well and realized that everything is going to go well. I think my dad is even starting to enjoy having all of us around all the time now too. I was surprised that things worked out so well. We have a lot of fun times now.

In my last entry, I told you I was planning a surprise birthday party for Alana, my girlfriend. Well, let me tell you, she was definitely surprised. I planned her party at the orphanage, where she spent a majority of the last year volunteering and reading to the children. These kids, oh my gosh, the bond Alana has with them is amazing! I knew the Alana, along with the kids would love celebrating her birthday there. So, the morning of Alana's birthday, I sent her to the salon for a morning spa date with her best friend. I needed her distracted if I was going to be able to pull this off. After Alana's friend Bri confirmed that Alana was preoccupied, I headed to the orphanage with the best decorations and party favors my dollar store budget could afford to decorate the tiny little room that the 10 children shared. They joyously prepped the room, eager for Miss Alana to see their work. Little did any of them know, I had my own surprise up my sleeve. Not only were we going to surprise Alana for her birthday, I was finally going to get down on one knee and ask that beautiful woman to be my wife. A few hours had passed, and Bri finally texted me that they were en route. I could feel my nerves building. In just a matter of minutes, Alana would walk through that door, and my life would chage forever. We turned the lights off and waited for Alana and Bri to appear in the door way. The moment that I had been waiting for was finally here. The girls were greeted with a roaring ""SURPIRSE!"" as soon as the door opened. I was standing there, sweating more than I think I ever have! I'm not sure exactly what I said to her, I know I fumbled and stuttered through an ""I love you more than anything else,"" and I might have even shed a tear. All I know is that when that moment came, I got down on one knee and finally asked the question that I have wanted to ask since I laid eyes on her, ""Will you marry me, Alana Moser?"" Tears filled her eyes and she jumped eagerly into my open embrace, and tearfully accepted my proposal. It was the perfect place, time and occasion to take the leap with her! She is finally my fiance, and I couldn't be happier!",,3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11ECYKV8WC,0.0

I had really been polishing my skills on my own recently and really wanted this job, it's at a great company with amazing pay and growth potential. There were a few interviews for the position. One was with HR just them getting to know me and vice versa. Another was a technical interview going over some specific things listed on my resume and how I would solve certain software problems associated. The technical interview was the most nerve wracking but I thought it went okay. This was a long shot position that I just applied for to see if I'd get a callback and maybe some interview practice with a big software company. However, the most shocking part was when I got a call informing me I was being offered the position I applied for and if I was still interested. The wave of emotion and adrenaline was almost overwhelming, it was difficult to stay professional over the phone with this feeling rushing through me.  (This company was not Microsoft by the way but is a large well known company). I think part of the reason I was hired was because it isn't about the money or the prestige of working at a great place like this, but that I'm really just excited to learn about their process of finding solutions and developing software in this kind of scope and scale.

Getting a job with one of the big boys means that all the hard work and the sleepless nights are finally paying off. That it was all worth it. That I made the right decision.  I can't believe it's only been three months since I got hired.  It was hectic right after I got the news.  All of a sudden I needed to find a new place to live halfway across the country. In a city I'd only been in once. That's crazy isn't it? Coming down for the interview was the first time I ever set foot in the city itself.  I didn't know anyone here at all. Hell, I didn't even know where to get a decent cup of coffee. At least I got the coffee thing figured out now.  That's when it all really set in for me. Once I had found a place to live and found a place that I could get decent coffee.  I didn't have much time to really think about it until then I guess.  The job is pretty much what I expected.  In the back of my mind I was worried that I was going to settle in after orientation and realize that I'd just made a huge mistake. A mistake that I'd signed a contract committing to making every single day for the next five years.  Including a no compete clause so if I'd really hated it then I would have been in trouble.  All in all though I'm happy. The work isn't as interesting as I would like it to me. It's not as boring as it could be though so silver linings. The folks in the office have been very welcoming so far and the office itself is amazing.  I loved my desk chair so much that I want out and bought one for myself.",,3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4MTP1WH,0.0

While on my visit, I got to see two of my favorite bands at a venue that is on my bucket list, Red Rocks. They were a week apart and were both amazing shows. The first show I got to go with my sister and it was electric. You could feel the magic in the air. Everyone at the concert was so happy to be in that place at that moment which really connected us all. I've never felt almost fellowship at a concert like this. The second show I went alone and had just as good a time, but it was more introverted as I went alone. I got to see my all-time favorite band at that concert and it was as good as I could have hoped for, even got my current favorite song played at encore. I walked away from the whole experience satisfied, but a little bit sad. My bucket list had a big tick on it now. All in all it was every bit of an amazing experience as I had hoped for. I am currently searching out new items to add to my bucket list now. I greatly enjoyed visiting my brother's family as well. This is the first time I had seen them since they moved to Colorado. I imagine this visit will become an annual thing.",3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4T2XW19,,0.0

There is a beautiful 2 mile walk through natural areas and for a while the path is near the river.  It is a pleasant walk that we've done with our dogs before.  It takes about an hour.  We're able to see native wildlife including hawks, eagles, song birds, rabbits, squirrels and even snakes.  We meet in the parking lot just after the bridge.  As I arrived at the parking lot I realized my gas tank was very low and I didn't now if I had enough gas to get home.  There is no gas station on the island the the nearest gas station was about 20 miles away in the opposite direction from where my friend lives.  We enjoyed the dog walk and our dogs did too.  We stopped at the nearby farm store where they have a grill and sell hot dogs and burgers and we each got a hot dog and a beer and had lunch.  I told my friend about my concern about running out of gas on the way home and being stuck on the side of the road with my dog.  My friend said not to worry and that she would follow me to the nearest gas station.  She said that she would stay with me if I ran out of gas or give me a ride to the gas station to pick up a container of gas so I could make it to the station.  We left the farm store and headed toward the gas station.  I was very anxious about running out of gas and the indicator on my dash was getting closer and closer to empty.  I barely made it to the gas station and was relieved to get the tank filled.  I thanked my friend and told her how grateful I was and vowed not to let my tank get that low again.",,3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4UPG1W8,0.0

I had previously explained to him that I liked more practical and less flashy jewelry but whenever we had looked at rings, I got the impression he didn't understand my taste. I was so surprised at how perfect it was, and how well he seemed to understand everything I told him, and then he explained to me that the diamonds were from his grandmothers wedding ring that she had left to him when she died, and he had had them reset for or me in a plain band. I loved it even more. He asked me to marry him again and I cried a little bit and said yes. The way he proposed the first time would have been fine.

He had asked me to marry him three years ago when our son was born, but he didn't have a nice ring and seemed embarassed about the whole thing. I said yes then, three years ago, but I was kind of disappointed about the way he asked. Not because he didn't have a nice ring, but because he just kind of blurted it out, and seemed really awkward and uncomfortable about it. I had just delivered our son, and it made me feel like he was just asking because he felt like that was what he SHOULD do, not necessarily because he wanted to. A few weeks ago, he planned a nice date night for us and we got the kids to bed early and we had a nice quiet dinner by ourselves and watched a movie we had both been looking forward to seeing. At the end of the movie, he kissed me and gave me a hug, and then he got down on the floor in front of me on his knees and took a small jewelry box out of his pocket and opened it. There was a small diamond ring inside and he explained that he had taken his grandmothers wedding ring, and had the diamonds reset in a plain band that he thought would be more my style. He told me that he had always hated the way he proposed the first time, and wanted to do it again, properly. He asked me again to marry him. Again, I said yes. THe ring is perfect for me, I'm surprised that he got it so perfect. I don't wear a lot of jewelry and I don't like things that are flashy.

I was always happy that we were engaged, and that we would be getting married eventually, and was excited to spend the rest of my life with him, but I like our proposal story a lot more now than I did the first time.",3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675VKZGO7L,3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675VKZGO7L,0.0

Maybe this is why so many of us put off— or avoid— meeting our metamours. Yet, there is something irreplaceable about making the space to get to know those connected to who we’ve been building a relationship with. Not only do we have at least one entire person in common with our metamours, but we also have personalities, cultures, and preferences that might not be met elsewhere. I was a bit hesitant about building a relationship with my polygamous partner, but as I read some articles such as the one posted above, I slowly drew into the idea that it might not be so bad after all.  Thus, a month ago, my partner introduced me to his other partner (his girlfriend). We had a short pleasant chat for a few hours and then went about our daily business. During that month again, my partner's other girlfriend reached out to me that she wanted all the 3 of us to go to a quiet cafe during the night and have a discussion with each other so we could get to know more about ourselves. I told my partner and he agreed. Thus 2 weeks ago, the 3 of us went to a cafe named the raising rabbit. The cafe was pleasantly beautiful and a bit empty, so we had a lot of time for ourselves. The menu they had was also great. We had a great chat and got to know exactly what each other liked and wanted in the relationship, how we should behave around each other, e.t.c. After we had done that, we decided to take a walk downtown. The walk was really nice, especially because the weather was so good while the skies were really clear that evening. We shared a quiet, happy evening together after the walk. It was such a great day.",,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZOJCWQ,0.0

We're poly, and that's important to me. We went out to a really nice cafe together, known for having good vegan options in town. It was a really stressful thing, trying to find places that would actively cater to my friend/my partner's partner. But, we found this place, and set out to go together. They were vastly understaffed, but the food was good and it was a quiet, gentle atmosphere. We took pictures together before we ate, and the meal was really nice to share. My partner sat between us, and we were all on a booth seat. We had a nice conversation and enjoyed the food. After that, we went out on a walk together throughout the town. It was a really nice experience, being able to be publicly affectionate without the worry of judgement. No one around here really knew us, we're just visitors. It's not like it'd have a lasting effect on us if they wanted to be upset with us for being visibly queer and non-monogamous. The feeling of safety and warmth of getting to spend time with my family, walking around, admiring the sunset and enjoying our meal together was wonderful. I will remember this day for a very long time. We had to go home that next day, but that night was one of the most memorable, holding hands freely in public, taking pictures, even being able to kiss in public. It was a nice feeling, that we rarely got to have, one that was set in a stunning backdrop of a quiet downtown and a cute vegan-friendly cafe. It almost seems like it couldn't be real, from how much fun we had.",,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZOJCWQ,0.0

I have been more anxious to go outside and do the things that I used to like doing. I have noticed that it is starting to affect my daughter. It kills me that my anxiety is having this effect on her. About 3 weeks ago I noticed that my anxiety would get really bad when I would drop my daughter off at school. Around this time she started to not act like her happy self and she started to detach herself from her friends.  She used to go out with her friends about every weekend and then a couple of days after school to work on homework.  Three weeks ago I noticed she wasn't doing this as often and she was staying home to make sure that I was okay. I decided that I needed to do something to change the situation. I needed to do it for her and for me. I decided to reach out for help. I called the family member in and asked what they thought I should do. They suggested I talk to a therapist. I called one up and immediately started seeing her. I was put on medication and started to feel better. I would go out with my daughter more and make myself face my fears. I encouraged her to hang out with her friends again and she has started to do so again. Everything is looking better now.,,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZP1WCU,0.0

She is a really good kid (who's kid isn't?) and we are very close.  She is a straight A student and wants to be a dentist and chose a school that has a great dental school for post-graduate studies.  Anyway the 2 weeks up to her leaving was pretty emotional and stressful.  i thought we would be having fun and taking the time we had left before college to hang out and do some things we had wanted to but never did.  I was surprised that it was the opposite of that and she wanted to spend more time with her friends and boyfriend than be at home with mom and dad.  I mean what was I thinking anyway?  I totally get that this is her last hoorah with her pals too and they are a lot of fun to hang out with.  During the day was kind of boring and she laid around a lot.  I could tell she was bored and ready to get on with her college life as work schedules, errands, family dinner, and household chores were not going to make her want to stay around all the time.  lol  So after a week of this I encouraged her to get out and see if any friends wanted to soak u the last rays of summer and she was all for it.  I came to realize that I think she felt obligated to stay home more and be in the house with us as much as possible but the time spent doing that wasn't very productive for us or her.  i want her to be happy instead of moping around feeling obligated to stay around her parents, I mean I appreciated her sentiment and she really wanted to be with us but I also think she wanted to approval to hang with her friends too.  She was much happier and we actually had much more meaningful interactions when she knew she was free to make her own decisions.  As drop off day came up we felt really good about leaving her for her new home at school.  We know she is a fully capable adult now and those last few days or week at home seeing her grow and be her own person kind of reinforced that.  I think the parents who cry alot and are way too emotional maybe never had that connection and feel that their chances are over.  I would disagree with that as I think letting your kids grow and have freedom is what they wanted all along.",3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZP1WCU,3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZP1WCU,0.0

I was out of town at the time of the first storm but came back to wet carpets and a damp smell. I couldnt figure out where the leak was coming from right away, but as the next storm came I started to hear dripping. I trace the dripping to the window where my AC unit plugged in. Sure enough the seal on the window was not very tight and the groove filled with water. This combined with the slightly downward angle of the unit caused a leak to happen. I took the unit out of the window and shut the window for the duration of the storm. Once the window unit was out I noticed that it was pretty dirty and had a bit of debris on the bottom helping the water to pool underneath. I removed the debris and wiped off the unit with a towel. I also placed a shim in place to get the angle more closer to 0 degrees to prevent leaking. I went upstairs to check the other units and they seemed fine. However once I turned on the upstairs one it started sputtering a bit of water. I took this one out of the window as well and turned it upside down onto a towel. There was a bit of loose droplets in there but i got most of them. As a precaution i placed a towel over it when i turned it back on to flick the remaining water into. After this event I will be sure to check the units every year.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP8P3Z,0.0

A bit over a year and a half ago - our community changed as we knew it. There was a mass shooting at our local high school. It left 17 of our students dead, and many more injured. It has been really, really hard for us as a community. While I work with students, luckily I did not lose any I knew. Anyway, so the event I'm specifically writing about happened maybe 2 months ago: it's been a while since the shooting itself, but the scars will always be there. The PTSD. All of it. So we were sitting in our church service, specifically for students, when something happens. I don't know if it was a mic error, or someone dropped something that echo'd, but there was a loud POP. It was loud. One of our students who had been injured in the shooting heard it, and he RAN. He ran and ran. He left the building completely before he recognized that it was okay, he was fine. It was heartbreaking to see - a year and a half later, how much destruction was in our community still. I can't believe it happened to this day.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5XVP3P5,0.0

It's my mom's favorite amusement park, and by proxy, I guess that makes it mine too. We've had season passes sense I can remember, but I've just gotten to the point where I will join her on the big rollercoasters she loves riding so much. There's the Scorpion, the Sizzler, and the Green Monster. That one is her favorite. We'd done all of the little kid stuff that I usually drag her to, and I could tell her energy was flagging. She'd been going through chemo for sometime, and I'm surprised she was able to take the hot Texas heat as long as she did. We would need to go home soon, where she'd fall asleep almost immediately upon sitting down on the couch. But first, we had to do the Green Monster. We waited in the snaking line, her resting against the guard rails along the way. When we finally got to the front, we sat in the very first row. She reminded me how rarely that happens. Immediately after the coaster took off, it began the slow ""click-click-click"" up the first hill, heading toward the first perilous drop. As we neared the top, someone tapped Mom's shoulder. She turned around and a little boy was behind her with his big brother (or so it seemed). ""Ma'am, you should take your hat off for this.""Mom faltered. She hated showing her bare head, bald from the chemo treatments. But reluctantly, she plucked it off and sat on top of it. She looked at me and gave my hand a squeeze. Seconds later, we plummeted down the track. I saw nothing but joy on her face.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5ZCR3P7,0.0

None of us had been to the amusement park as it just opened within the last couple years.  We arrived early so we were some of the first people allowed into the park that day.  We made sure to purchase a fast trak pass to let us get on the rides quickly.  We all love rollercoasters and thrill rides, which this park has a lot of.   Some of them were pretty scary.  There was a lot of walking around, the park is huge.  When lunch time came around we looked at all of the interesting things to eat.  We ended up getting a huge fish and chips plate to share between the three of us.  After lunch we decided to see a couple of shows that the park hosted.  They were very entertaining.  As it started to turn dark the park announced that it would be closing in a half hour, so everyone started heading for the exits.  Our time here was at a close, but it was very enjoyable.  After the park we went to a new pizza place that opened up in town.  The pizza there was amazing, albeit expensive.   Overall the trip was very memorable and we all had a lot of fun.",,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5ZCR3P7,0.0

It's been over a month now yet it is still just as upsetting now as it was then. Every time I'm on the subway I find myself looking around constantly, scanning everyone else up and down. I'm even thinking about what I should do if someone starts approaching me, where can I run to, where is the nearest exit, or is there anything I can just hide behind. Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it. I can barely handle it now. Things weren't all that stressful before the mugging, but now I'm almost having panic attacks just putting on my coat and tying my shoes. Everyone has noticed that I'm not going out anymore. Everyone at work can see that I'm almost falling apart. And I just can't stand going to work, climbing down the stairs at that same station. It doesn't matter what time it is, even when there are a hundred people on the platform.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IGKWQ1S,0.0

The reason it was so memorable was for starters it caused a fight within my family.  Since my mother is sick and my father is the primary caregiver I had to ask my siblings if they would take care of her for a week while I took my father on the trip. They weren't happy about this. It caused a big argument.  In the end they agreed.  We set a date for my father and boyfriend to pack up and head 8 hours north with my father's fishing boat which he hadn't taken out in years.  My father is 80 years old.  He grew up in WI and misses trips tremendously. It made me feel goo inside to take him.  You never know when it may be their last. We spent the trip fishing, telling stories, visiting old friends and eating as much as we could.  Lake time was super important so we made sure to get up early and spend a lot of time fishing the lake.  Although we didn't catch a lot of fish due to the time of year, we still have a great time.  It was well worth it to see that big grin on my father's face.  In the end everyone pitched in to give a really nice memorable gift to my father.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IXDYQ1X,0.0

The whole family was so excited to get a our new puppy. We had spent months trying to find the perfect one to bring into our home. Then we finally found Louie, a perfect little springer spaniel. The only problem was that he was a couple of states over. We planned a road trip to go pick him up, and it was going to take us about 8 hours to get there. We were all super excited and began our trip on Friday morning. Dad didn't check the car for any problems as it's usually fine, but we all definitely regret not convincing him to. We were only 2 hours into the ride when the car started to smell a little a funky. We didn't think much of it since we just wanted to see our cute new puppy. Then after another hour the check engine light came on and that was a sign for the worst. Only 3 hours into the trip and the engine was billowing smoke all over the highway. Turns out the radiator blew and it wasn't going to be possible to keep driving. The owner of the puppy said we had to be there as it was a first come first serve deal and the puppy was definitely wanted by more people than us. Without a way to keep on going, Dad called up AAA and had them tow the car. They couldn't tow the car to where we were going and then back, so we had to cancel the trip and go home. Because of this we missed on the opportunity to get the puppy. Since then we've been very demotivated to try and find a new puppy.",,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK,0.0

Another benefit is that we are saving more money now than we had before. Moving out on our own really helped my mental state  too. I was locked in to a state of depression I couldn't shake off.

I wasn't happy period.  I couldn't figure out why I was so miserable. My husband was great. He tried so hard. But eventually I just blamed him. I started being nasty. I pushed him away all the time. I hated when he did nice things for me. I hated everything, even the things that had nothing to do with him.

We had nothing on our calendar for the first time in ages. We hopped in the car and headed out to get our supplies for the day. First we went and grabbed a few movies from our local movie rental place. Thankfully they had a deal on older movies so we managed to get four of them for only a few bucks. Then we went to our supermarket and bought tons of junk food. The best stuff you could find. Then we went back home and devoured all of our snacks. We had cookies, brownies, frozen pizzas, chips, and popcorn. We then sat on the couch and watched 80's and 90's movies all day. We enjoyed the opportunity to show our son some of the movies made before he was born, and it's nice that he's at an age where we can actually experience this with him. Most of the movies were comedy flicks, so we were laughing and having a great time well into the evening hours. After another frozen pizza and a few more cookies for all of us, we finally turned in for bed. All in all it was a great day spent doing very little other than bonding with our son. He was so excited to see older movies that he wants to do the same exact thing in two weeks!",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK6X4UW,0.0

Earlier that evening I had suddenly gotten my tax return in my account. I immediately sent a good portion of the money to my mom as me and her had agreed. I immediately called my best friend and asked if she wanted to hang out. She said yes under the condition that I'd leave at 12am. So, I took an uber to her place in the city and we hung out. I was quite drunk when I left, ended up talking to a random guy who I end up going to 7/11 with. While inside, in line, a different person walks in, demands my wallet and stabs me three times in my breast, arm and side with a box cutter. I was taken to a local hospital, scanned, was crying, and then was told they needed to do exploratory surgery on my abdomen. Now a few interesting things happen when you find yourself the victim of a violent crime. Firstly, now I had to recover from surgery. From there, I had to have quite an intimidating interview with the police department in the city. Of course, despite the fact this happened on camera in a store in the richer part of the city they did not catch the guy. Now, I found myself having to deal with the psychological horror of yet another near death experience, and still dealing with it (as this happened roughly 6 months ago.) Finding a therapist has literally took me this long. But, I had to find a silver lining which is, now I can stay on therapy if I lose my insurance (I'm currently unemployed and am on medicaid) due to our state's victims compensation fund. Luckily, I have an amazing support system and I had a lot of different people reach out, but, it's still a long process.",3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD,0.0

I wished, throughout my pregnancy, that my grandmother were here. I wanted to talk to her and get advice and comfort from her. Unfortunately, she had already passed away. I loved her very much - she was like a mother to me. Throughout my pregnancy, I continued to speak with her in my mind, convinced she could hear me. Afterward, I would feel much better. When it was time for my baby to be born, I was so excited but scared. In the end, I delivered and looked at my baby girl: I was surprised to see that she had my grandmother's eyes. I knew then, without a shadow of a doubt, that my grandmother was with me. She was a part of my daughter.

I still can’t believe it at times that this happened. She was so healthy before this, no warning signs, no symptoms.. it was shocking to everyone.  I found her in her room one day after school. She was on the ground and having trouble speaking. I called 911 and they arrived quickly. I’m not sure if she would’ve made it if they hadn’t. She spent 3 weeks in the hospital. It was a really rough time for us both. I stayed with her almost every night. I was really scared, and couldn’t leave her side.   I’m happy to say, she’s doing much better now. She is back to living on her own. She’s taking physical therapy for some of the movement she lost in her arm, but otherwise she’s good as new. She survived!

It was in the next town and I do not own a car so I had to take a very early bus. There was a bad ice storm that day and it took a lot longer than I expected to get there.  Since I was running late I did not have time to get anything to eat before the deposition. During the deposition I was asked a lot of questions about my memory of the events (which I do not want to get into too much detail) and they continually made me feel like a liar and incompetant. They kept on implying that I was a bad person and it was a big pain in the ass. Afterwords I had to catch another bus back and only had time to get a hot dog from a street vendor. It must have been a bad one because on the ride back I was throwing up the whole way.  Luckily a kind person in the next seat helped me and gave me water and some baby wipes to clean up with.  It was a horrible experience overall but could have been even worse without the kindness of that man. I have developed a hatred for busses.  I no longer feel so great about hot dogs either. MY advice to others would be to not trust street food, especially if you are already stressed out. The stomach can do nasty things to you if it is not treated well. Hopefully I will never go through that again.",,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS93IHQCX,0.0

They were represented by four different insurance companies and their lawyers who scheduled my deposition (answering questions before a court reporter). A snowstorm was predicted in the days leading up to the scheduled date. I tried to get it postponed, but my opponents refused. I had to wake at around 4:45 a.m. and dress in the freezing cold in the dark, and drive to a coffee house on icy roads to use the restroom and have a bite to eat. Then I walked on icy roads to the bus stop, leaving my car in a safe parking space. The bus trip was about two hours with one transfer to a second bus. The deposition was held in a basement room in the courthouse since they didn't have to pay a fee for the room. It was gray, with basic table and chairs, and without windows, dimly lit. I played dumb as everyone assembled and was able to overhear a couple bits of useful information. I was not surprised that they started by trying to pick a fight about our agreement to end by 5 p.m. so I could catch my return buses. I maintained my position but the nastiness was relentless. Two of them glared at me with hatred most of the day. At lunch we took a quick break and I ate a pouch of lentils and rice I had brought (no microwave available to heat it). One attorney spent most of the day questioning me so they could say they had many questions left and force me to return a second day. This was expected, a typical game, but it started a further fight about scheduling the second day. By the end of the day I was exhausted but pleased about how I had answered their questions. I had expected I might get motion sick on the return bus as I had on previous similar trips. The long bumpy trip with exhaust fumes trapped inside the bus, and reducing my fluid intake due to lack of restroom available, was almost guaranteed to make me sick. I had even brought a couple barf bags in case. I was surprised, however, that I threw up during most of the return trip. When I recall it, it crosses my mind that they poisoned me, not likely physically, but the equivalent psychologically. It took weeks before my digestive system returned to normal.",3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS93IHQCX,,0.0

It was so great to see all of the sights that we have seen in books or on the internet! We did all the things that we wanted to do and ate so much. We went to a nice little bistro that it outside of the city limits and had a nice dinner there. The coffee was fantastic as well! We had seen a lot of people talking about the mass at the Notre Dame Cathedral. It was one of those things that we knew we wanted to do when we came to Paris. We ended up researching it and finding out when the perfect time was to do that. We went on Sunday and I can't tell you how special that was! It felt like being in a movie! The building was beautiful and the sounds coming from the voices in the Notre Dame Cathedral was magical. I couldn't believe how special the whole experience was. Thankfully, we got to do that before the building had burned down. That was heartbreaking to see.

I had insisted on a 5 p.m. end time but they started right in to pressure me on this. Two of them made angry faces at me most of the time. They dragged out the deposition so I'd be forced to schedule a second day. They concocted nasty and unfathomable procedural offenses on my part. One insisted on interrupting so that two were questioning me at the same time. There was a short lunch break at which I ate my barley and lentil pouch without benefit of microwave. Finally, it was over. I threw up through a good part of the return bus trip. Fortunately, I had packed a barf bag.

This isn't normally a traumatic event but it was for me. I couldn't sleep one night, so I as up late. It was around 3am when I started to feel very strangely, dizzy, disoriented and scared. I woke my husband up and asked him to take me to the emergency room. Once we got there they ran many tests to find out why I was feeling the way I was. My blood sugar was very high, dangerously so. The doctor was surprised I wasn't in a diabetic coma. I was in the hospital for around 20 hours while they tried to determine if anything else was wrong with me. They were worried I might have had a stroke due to some of my symptoms. I had lots of blood work and a contract MRI done, as well as x-rays and cognitive tests. Once they were sure that I hadn't had a stroke they tried to bring my blood sugar down to a safe level. I was given multiple injections over several hours that failed to bring it down significantly. Finally it came down just barely into safe levels and they sent me home. Since that incident I have changed my life style. I've changed how I eat, started working out and running six days a week and lost forty pounds.

So, I decided to start exercising. It was really hard for the first few weeks, but eventually I started a rhythm. To boost my weight loss, I also changed what I was eating in my diet. After 6 months, I really started to see a difference in my body. I had more energy, my clothes were fitting, I felt pretty good! Because of that, I decided to start training for a 5k. I would start off running every morning and day after day I would go a mile further. This was hard on my body. My feet started to hurt and swell. My knees killed me and my legs felt like jelly. I didn't think I could do it. Then, at the fourth month, I caught my stride. Adding an extra mile everyday didn't seem so bad on my body anymore. My lungs didn't burn and I wasn't huffing and puffing. The day finally arrived for the race. It was a chilly morning, but enough to get me energized and to wake up. More people were at the race than I thought there was going to be. However, even though I didn't get first place, I won something for myself.

I'm someone who's been overweight my entire life. About a year and ago I decided to change things and started losing weight and working out.  For the first time ever, I was very successful and stuck with it. Soon after I had started exercising, I decided I wanted to take up running. Now I'm someone who always HATED running. I could barely run ten feet, so this was quite a feat to accomplish. The next morning I headed outside and started a running app to help me train to run a 5k. This seemed like something I'd never be able to do. I started doing intervals of running and walking three times a week and it was HARD. I ran so slowly and felt like I was going to die, but I kept at it. As time went on, it got a little easier and I was able to run for longer distances. Soon I was able to run for a mile at a time, which was crazy to me. I kept going and going and I realized that I started to actually enjoy running. Instead of dreading it, I was looking forward to my time running. This was probably the biggest surprise of the whole story. I never imagined myself enjoying running. I ended up completing the program and signing myself up for the main event. A 5k race. I was very proud of myself for getting to this point. However, my proudest moment was running that 5k three months ago. I finished it with a decent time and everyone who knows me was extremely proud of that accomplishment. I now consider myself a runner.",,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862FM6S9G,0.0

I tried to point out to her some of the ways we could donate a portion of it away and why, and she was trying to explain her reasoning as well.

I had packed up my bag for the night and said goodbye to my son, as i drove to my friends house it was one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in my life, i was trying to keep it together and try not to turn around and go back. one of the hardest part for me to accept also was not being able to see my son for awhile. he is very young and i knew he would not understand what was happening or why. A few days later her parents came to our home to pack up some of her stuff to take with. I remember them asking what the plan was moving forward and me trying to explain to them what my plan was that i knew of so far but that i did not have all the answers. I remember i took my son for a few days while they packed up and left behind what she didn't want. we only lived in a apartment so there wasn't a whole lot of possessions to take. After she had finished packing and left with our son, I walked into our apartment knowing that life would never be the same again, that I would have to sacrifice time spent with my son but knowing that if i could just hold onto what would be better in the future for everyone that thats what i should do. It would be better for him to grow up with both of us happy instead of us staying together and being miserable just for the sake of appearances.

They needed someone to help set up and also had a groomsman slot open since it was a rather close friend. The bachelor party was pretty fun, but I won't go into detail as it involved bar hopping. Getting ready for the event was cumbersome though. They wanted a pretty crazy elaborate wedding and all of us needed to help them with it. I found a DJ for their reception. I did most of the budgeting for them but allowed them to make the final decisions of course. We had other people decide the colors and layout. The wedding was pretty big--around 150 people showed up, and the reception went rather well. It was exhausting but fun, and I was really happy for my friend and his wife. It made me think about my own life a little and how I should get started with raising a family. I probably need to sit down and have a talk with some close people in my life.

She was about 14 and was part Lab. She had some of the breathing problems that Labs are prone to have where their lungs can't get the amount of oxygen as they need. She was the third family dog that we had had from a puppy until death. Ghost, our first, lived 17 years. Casper, our 2nd, lasted 15 years. So, after being with them for so many years, we get quite attached to them. Cheebs had been going downhill for several years and there was nothing the vets could really do anymore to relieve her problem. So, it was up to us to decide if the joy of having her around us and her joy of being around us was better for her than suffering thru the medical condition. Finally, it got to the point where we decided it was no longer fair to her, that she was suffering too much. So, my wife and I agreed and our oldest son concurred that it was time. We took her out to the car and helped her get in the back seat. She knew that she was going to the Vets as that was the only time she got to ride. We had called our Vet ahead so they were waiting on us. I got to the vet and my wife went in and told them that we were here. I tearfully walked her through the parking lot and we went in and back to the room. She was very calm, almost like she knew what was up. It only took a few minutes for the drug to act and she calmly and peacefully looked at me until her eyes closed. I loved her and miss her dearly.",3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZX0WW,,0.0

Today was a very emotional day. I had to have our old dog put down. She was a big sweetie. We (my wife and I) have had several dogs over the years. We get quite attached to them and they have always lived a long time. Ghost was 17, Casper was 16, and now Cheeba, who was 13. I will miss Cheebs, as I called her, as I feel this may be the last dog that my wife and I get as we are getting up in years ourselves. Cheeba was having respiratory problems that have been getting worse and worse until some days she could hardly catch her breath. Her appetite was about gone except for special meals that I would fix her. Cheebs was a great dog- lots of intense love went both ways. We had had her since she was a very young puppy. She was very protective of our family, but not mean at all. So, today has been one of the worst days of my life. We agreed that she was suffering and no way to get better and we were just being selfish, so we decided today would be it. We called our Vet who had been expecting this call. He told us to come on and with a heavy leaden heart, we got her into the car. She liked car rides and didn't mind the vet as she'd known the same one all her life. We both got out of the car with tears in our eyes and let her pee on the grass and then took her inside. They were ready for us and  we put her on the table and got her calm and said our good-byes. It was almost like she looked at me with understanding and was okay about it. We stayed with her and the Vet injected her with the drug. After a few seconds, her eyes closed and she went unconscious and died almost immediately. We felt about as bad as one can and I hope she is waiting for me when I have my last journey too.",3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZX0WW,,0.0

But a note in your birthday card is up there with really bad ways to find out. Especially when it arrives the day before your birthday and you had big plans. A trip out of time, tickets to a concert and nice hotel room suddenly seemed about as appealing as a plate of rotten fish. My Mom has always been there for me through all my mistakes and failures. Always trying to help, although never really having the right words. But just knowing that at least one person was one my side was usually enough to get me through to the next thing. The card and the note hit me like a train. It didn't really say how serious or treatable the cancer might be. So I was left wondering about her health as I  broke the news to my friend going with me that the trip was off. Although I live a short distance from my parents, I don't go over there anymore because of my father being such a jerk. I got tired of the fighting and insults and vowed to never set foot there again. My brother had wisely made the decision 25 years earlier, so I knew he would have no info either. I was filled with dread and fear as I picked up the phone to call.  They say no news is good news, but not so much when it's your Mom's health. Of course my call goes to voicemail, which further increases my anxiety. The next day my Mom calls me back to say that she has a tumor but they think they will be able to operate and remove it. Fortunately they don't find any cancer in the bloodstream or lymph nodes. Having been through a breast cancer scare with my best friend a year early I knew this was a good sign. Yet still I was mostly paralyzed with a foreboding sense of doom and a real trepidation that my biggest supporter in life might not be around too much longer. As each day ticked off until the operation I could barely think of anything else and could barely get any work done. When it was over, the doctors said that they were very successful in getting the tumor out, and they had no concern that it had spread but chemo would still be necessary.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ3U3NRW,0.0

It had been six months since we had seen them. When we went to the airport to pick them up, our grandson had been so excited that he had hardly any sleep on the flight over.  For the next couple of days, our grandson was so excited, and he talked constantly. His body clock was still on European time, so he woke up every morning around 4:00 am to begin the day. Of course we wanted to spend as much time with them as possible, so we all got up at four in the morning.  The first morning, by about 6:00 in the morning, he had already eaten breakfast and was ready for some ice cream.  We all ate ice cream cones at about six in the morning! That was a lot of fun!  On another day, because he enjoyed hot chocolate, we sat together in a recliner and had our ""coffee"".  One morning, while his grandfather was making scrambled eggs and sausage for breakfast (one of my grandson's favorite foods for breakfast) he was still so excited, and exclaimed ""I love Grandma's house!"" He made both Grandma and Grandpa very, very happy. During the next week, we went out everyday to do something fun together. One evening my son went out to spend some time with a friend, so I prepared our grandson for bed. I received lots and lots of hugs and kisses, while saying our good nights and I love yous and tucking him in. That week was so wonderful.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ4ONRN9,0.0

I took the sandwich to the park near the museum that Jenny and I have lunch only 8 weeks ago.  we had such a nice lunch and she told me about all the exciting details in her life.  Her career was going wonderful.  Her parents wanted her to do something practical but she wanted to be a model.  I supported her and I spent many nights on the phone listening to her complain about my daughter and son-in law.  She had a new boyfriend and loved her little apartment.  Two weeks after that lunch Jenny was gone.  I have a hard time holding back the tears as I write this. I was a bit afraid to go to the exhibit.  I thought I might breakdown.

I had awoken early, had breakfast at the motel and then drove downtown to visit an art museum I had been planning to see. I arrived early and was one of the first ones to enter. I noticed five other people waiting, two couples, one in their 50s the other couple younger, perhaps in thier 30s. There was also an older woman, she looked like she could be in her 80s. She wore a coat although it wasn't that cold out and walked with a distinctive wooden cane. The two couple went in as soon as the doors were unlocked and I held the door for the older woman to enter. The museum had a special showing of photographs from famous artist in Canada. I took my time walking through and viewing the work. On the third floor I noticed the old woman standing in front of two photographs by a woman photographer (I'll leave her name out) and I smiled at her as I passed behind the old woman and glanced at the photographers name and saw there were two photos of her work. I continued on and then went to the basement cafe for some coffee and a pastry. I was there about 30 minutes. I decided to walk through the museum again. On the third floor I noticed the old woman still standing in the same place. I approached her and after making eye contact, I ask her if she was OK?""Oh yes, quite,"" she said, ""I'm just admiring my granddaughter's photographs.""""Oh, this photograph is your granddaughter?"" I asked.""She was,"" said the old woman, ""but I'm afraid she died three years ago, an accident, she was 37.""I told her how terribly sorry I was and then she told me she's lived in that town, but her granddaughter worked in Montreal,  so she only saw her every few years. But now she had come for eight days in a row and would continue to come into the work was moved to another city as it made her feel closer to her granddaughter than she had ever been. i complimented the work and invited the old woman down to the cafe for coffee. She talked to me for an hour about her life, but mostly of her daughter (who also had died) and her granddaughter.",3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ5B6NRZ,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ5B6NRZ,0.0

I did not know if I would enjoy it, I had never done it before. I thought how bad could it be? Being one with nature, enjoying the cool breeze and hiking around wherever we end up. I spent about an hour driving to the camp site, even the drive was fun. I was happy at this point and looked forward to the camp to come. I arrived and set up my tent, this was really difficult and I was already getting frustrated. I could tell that I might not enjoy this after all. I looked to the left and saw a mouse. The mouse was odd looking, I wasn't sure what was wrong with it but I was a little creeped out. It started circling me and I was really regretting doing any of this. I wanted to just leave, but the mouse had me trapped! I threw a rock at it and grabbed all my things and ran back to the car. I got in the car and wondered what the hell just happened.

On my way there,  I saw a sign for a blood donation drive that was occurring that day. They desperately needed people to offer their blood. On impulse I decided to go in and donate. I was a first time blood donor so the volunteers and nurses put me through a screening process and gave me a questionnaire. I passed the screening and proceeded to donate my blood. The process itself had no complications and took about 15 minutes. Afterwards I sat at a table where there were cookies and apple juice. I felt fine at first but within a few minutes I started to feel dizzy. All of a sudden, I keeled over and went into a dream world. When I woke up, I was lying down, face up, and the nurses and volunteers told me I had fainted. They tried to stabilize me, but I fainted again and had to be brought to the hospital. I was put on IVs for a couple of hours. Although I had a severe reaction to donating blood, and I sustained injuries as a result of fainting, I still consider it a positive experience because I potentially saved someone else's life and had so many people helping me, like the volunteers, nurses, and EMT.  I felt so much humanity that day.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQFACNRD,0.0

I'm a major homebody nowadays - what with having moved away from family, friends, civilization as I had always known it. I don't explore, I don't go out, I like comfy socks and TV shows. I live in the most rural area I've ever seen in my life after growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Talk about culture shock. But anyway, the last time I'd visited Pennsylvania, she had talked about doing an Escape Room as a team building thing for work and I expressed how much I wanted to try one of those. So even though I didn't know what I wanted to do after my birthday, my mom found an Escape Room in a nearby city. She booked it and we went. So this being my first Escape Room, I had no idea what to expect. Mom sent me the list of the ""scenarios"" and said we should do an easier one since it was my first, but the one that struck my fancy was the one where I was supposed to be an FBI agent - the hardest one. I said, ""I hear what you're saying, but I want to be an FBI agent!"" So that's the one we did. And we did really well. At first there were so many different things that could be puzzle pieces that I was literally running from corner to corner wondering where to start. That took more time than it needed to, but once the first puzzle got solved it was pretty smooth sailing. We were in the room with three teenagers who seemed a little shy. Having worked retail, I tried to introduce myself and get their names because - you know, team building. It took a little while for them to really start engaging with us.  The whole thing went by in a blur and I honestly barely remember the entire process, I just know I had a great time and that we got the very, very last piece of the puzzle - a book with the code to unlock the door - when the clock was at 30 seconds. At this point, we weren't thinking as much as we should have been anymore and all but ignored the telling part of the clue that revealed the page of the book the code would be on. I was proud for almost getting out though, I think we definitely would have done if we didn't get frantic. Afterwards my husband told me that he loved seeing me like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. ""You were so amazing in there, you took charge of the situation and told people what you thought and I loved it."" I didn't realize how naturally I'd fallen back into my Assistant Manager role where I knew what to do and how it needed to get done, but it felt really good. It was a much needed reminder that I have valuable problem solving skills and leadership skills that I can apply when given the opportunity.",3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQXEZRNU,,0.0

I'm pretty comfortable being a homebody and just hanging out with my cats. A couple of years ago me and my now-husband moved from our home state and away from my family, who I miss every day. Every year my mom will come down to visit in the spring time. This year she came the weekend after my birthday in April with her fiance so that we could have a mini-celebration. I had told her that I've been wanting to do an Escape Room for a while now, and she found one in my area so that we could all go do it together. I was really excited because I LIVE for puzzles. The Escape Room was very confusing at first - as I'd never ever done one before - but once I got the hang of the process it was so much fun. My team consisted of me, my husband, my mom, her fiance, and four teenage strangers. We ended up racing the clock to the very last minute, literally. We were holding the book with the code to escape the room when time ran out! Surprisingly, the most memorable part of the event was the aftermath. My husband told me he loved seeing me that way. I asked what way? And he told me how my leadership skills and ability to put together seemingly insignificant details was something he didn't get to see in me all that often. And that's true, as a homebody I don't do a whole lot with friends. I don't play too many games. I don't really have a job where I can apply those abilities in my day to day. It was a definite reminder that I am a capable person when given the opportunities to apply myself. All in all, I had so much fun and I really hope to do it again sometime soon.",3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQXEZRNU,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQXEZRNU,0.0

The day of, we found out by other people that majority of our family members weren't going to make it to his party. Not only were my husband and I let down, my kids were disappointed. We were so heart broken for them. Their cousins weren't there to play with them so they were they only kids. We of course decided to make the best of it and my husband ran around and played with our toddler while the one-year-old was getting plenty of attention from his grandparents and great grandparents. On the bright side, there was an abundance of food and drink for us all. We only had the party room rented for a couple hours so we needed to start packing up our food and decorations in time for the employees to clean. It felt like the party flew by! My mom had the funny idea of having my grandma, her, myself and my sister to all go down the giant inflatable slide together. She wanted to end the day on a positive and fun memory. After laughing about the idea, we starting climbing into the slide. My mom went down first and after much effort my sister and I made it down. We waited a while for my grandma to get to the top. The happiest and silliest moment of the day was watching her have so much fun sliding down the slide. We all got packed up and said our goodbyes with hugs to end the day.",3U5NZHP4LSOTHP5LI6L0MKZFALSPHJ,,0.0

My eyes started tearing up and i was just confused. We had just bought a new apartment together so i really couldn't put 2 and 2 together. She was someone that i really cared about. She was my first love if i had to put it in exact words. She had been lying to me this whole time. All the times she said that she loved me was all lies.

I was invited by my best friend, his girlfriend and her sister. I was originally going to decline the invitation but I was able to get the weekend off at work so I decided I would go. We left Saturday afternoon and arrived in Orlando later that night. After arriving there , we went out to dinner with some of our friends who live in town. We were able to catch up on our lives for a couple of hours before we headed to the hotel to check in and sleep. The next day we got up and went to breakfast to get our stomachs full for a day of drinking and dancing. After filling our bellies we went to a liquor store to get out party supplies and then headed back to the hotel to pre-game. Afterwards, we went to the location of the festival and let the sounds of the electronic music move our bodies. I usually don't dance much but the alcohol changed my entire mindset. I found myself shuffling and dancing to the music as if I did it for a living. I had an absolute blast dancing all along the edge of the pool with the other party goers. This went on for about five hours before the rain started falling. It was then that we decided that our age was catching up to us and decided to call it a night. We went out to eat before heading back to the hotel to rest up for the trip back home the next day. It was an absolute blast of a weekend and I wouldn't mind going again.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPG884ZF,,0.0

So much has been going on in my life.  Things have been pretty stressful which is why I'm so glad made an addition to our family!  About 6 months ago we adopted Azul.  Azul is our amazing Blue-headed macaw.  He is so much fun.  He was just a baby when we adopted him from Angelina Jolie!  I still can't believe we got to meet her.  She was volunteering at the local animal shelter and we happened to be there at the same time.  That just makes Azul so much more special to us.  So Azul has been flying everywhere and getting very confident in his abilities.  We've been working on training him to do certain tricks.  Just within the past week we were able to get him to step onto our hand!  It's so cute to see him walk so gently right into the palm of my hand.  I am so in love with him.

It took me a couple months to believe that I wasn't suddenly just a useless, lazy waste of oxygen. That I needed someone who wasn't me to judge the situation. I had a hard time with the meds at first. There's a stigma. And therapy didn't magically fix me either. All my therapist could do was try and teach me coping methods and how to recognize the warning signs. Recognizing that there was a chemical imbalance in my brain didn't immediately cure me. It wasn't a waste of time but I still had a lot of work to do and it took time. Somewhere in there I decided I was worth the effort. Not every day is perfect but I've really been feeling back to myself the past couple months and it's amazing the difference. I wonder how I didn't notice how off kilter I was when I was in the trenches. It seems obvious to me, now,that I shouldn't feel the need to cry over an, admittedly, endless pile of dishes in the sink. I shouldn't feel defeated at the thought of taking a shower. I hope I never forget how I felt in that hard time, so I feel compassion and understanding for those struggling and can do my best to help others while remaining reasonable and unoffended when I am unable to ""fix"" them.",,3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPXE7Z42,0.0

I remember it being such a beautiful day. The sort of day where the sky is a brilliant blue and the sun is just shinning down and it feels like there's absolutely no way anything could possibly go wrong. Well, to my shock things did go quite wrong. As we drove through the swamp land, me being careful to stay on the well marked roads because I wanted to make sure to keep my daughter safe I found that the roads were actually torn apart. Since I hadn't realized this in a timely fashion I ended up flipping the car off of the side of the road into the mud. Thankfully both my daughter and I were both still awake after this and not hurt badly. But I realized that we were hopelessly stuck as the doors had been jammed shut and I felt something pressing against me so I couldn't really move my left arm at all. I called for emergency services and fortunately they arrived quite quickly and were able to easily and efficiently get both of us out of the car and transported to the hospital. At the hospital the on call doctor did a full workup of both of us to make sure there was no lasting damage. Fortunately the doctor was not able to find anything seriously wrong with either of us. When I think back to that day that is probably the one outcome that I'm most thankful for seeing how many different ways this could have wound up being so much worse. Once we were discharged from the hospital I did some research on the roads in that area since I had always known them to be safe and never troublesome I was quite upset about what happened. After some extensive research I learned that the company had been pumping the swamps the last few days but had neglected to put up any sort of caution signs or do the required testing. This lack of signage is what directly lead to our accident and did not allow road users to be properly aware of a very important ongoing situation. I immediately notified my state's authorities of the issues that were going on with the company in the hopes that they would be able to help prevent something similiar happening to someone else. I understand that it's always best to try to help out others and by getting up proper notifications and warnings I would be helping many others in the long run avoid getting through what we did and possible even suffering from a worse outcome.",,3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ82Y6Q08,0.0

On the left there was water crossing over the road to the other side. It seemed to have been flowing from one swamp to another.  It wasn't raining, so I felt this was a very odd thing to have happen during summer.  We suddenly hit the water and started fishtailing it. The car started to slide all over and I was losing the ability to control it.  I was so scared and she was screaming in her car seat.  The car turned and crashed into a tree.  I was horrified. I thought I killed my daughter, but I could hear her screaming. Well she had bumped her head but no bleeding. I called 911 to come find us but they could't find our road on the system.  We were on an old back road which had flooded. I was able to get myself out of the car and Alice out as well. Finally the 911 operator had said she found us. I was very grateful for it. Once we were check out we both had to go to the hospital in an ambulance as I had a broken arm and poor Alice had a concussion. The poor dear.

I couldn't stop talking about my son to everyone I know. Even my friends got bored of listening to talk about him all the time, the joy of fatherhood was just overwhelming. After about two years, my wife and I were advised by some friends to start potty training. We didn't have any idea on what to do, as he was our was first child. We decided to talk my parents to get some tips on how to go about. Once we were about to start potty training him, we made a time-table, which mostly based on when at first it was fun.  We thought everything was going great, we were having fun introducing the potty to him and demonstrating when he is supposed to use the potty. After the first week there was no improvement, we still were highly motivated to keep going, as were still had other methods and processes to try. After two more weeks it became clear that he was not improving in anyway, no matter the process we tried, even when we tried rewarding him he still did not improve. My wife and I then decided to go online for some updated information about potty training, because at that point we were already frustrated. We found some information which we applied. After the application and there was some slight improvement, but it was far from the main goal. We finally caved after about two months and we had to higher a professional. Hiring the professional was not cheap, but we had to make the sacrifice, also we were already emotionally exhausted. After about two weeks of hiring the professional there was some significant improvement. Till today we still wonder what we did wrong.",,3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ8BTZQ00,0.0

They had a big party to celebrate that a great comma had been watching us with a project that the company would benefit greatly. Everyone was very happy and I could only see Teresa from human resources. She had taken A holiday in southern Greece and really looked more beautiful than normal. I wondered if she is admiring her beauty or was admiring the fact that she looked so relaxed and fresh and at that time I asked her to tell me about her vacation when that moment a companion arrived and fell and the champagne that he brought in the cup went to give the beautiful dress that the young woman brought. Immediately went to clean and I continued admiring its beauty in the distance. The next day some friends arrived with a money problem that to be honest do not understand something about bowling and I really ignored them, all the time I spent thinking about Teresa and her beautiful wine-colored dress.

I talked to her but one day. unfortunately, she left work. got a better job offer and without hesitation she left. So now I only think if I will see her again one day. I hope it's like that.

But as it turned out, I really liked the therapist and enjoyed talking to her. So I went back week after week and looked forward to it. We talked about all kinds of things, but the main issue I wanted to address was why I was never interested in having a boyfriend. In high school my friends always were excited about dating. Sometimes they would be ecstatically happy about their boyfriend and another time they would be terribly depressed about a break-up. At parties you would see couples pairing off and making out. Many times 'he kissed me' would be the main topic of conversation with my friends. But I never quite understood what the attraction was. I didn't have any desire for a boyfriend. I didn't even think sex sounded interesting or desirable. And still, to this day, I have not been interested in dating. I enjoy people. I love people. But I don't have an interest in finding 'love' like you see in the movies. Well, I was surprised and, I guess, even relieved when the therapist diagnosed me as 'asexual'. Maybe I shouldn't describe it as a diagnosis because it's not a disease. There is not anything 'wrong' with me. In fact, I'm kind of glad to be asexual. Apparently, it has saved me from a lot of pain in life!",,3UN61F00HXB2D915UWOG2IW4ON95RY,0.0

After the wedding we all headed to the reception to enjoy some good food and entertainment. My cousin however wasn't so happy when the caterers brought the food and cake out. It was a disaster. They totally screwed up the menu, it was like they got another wedding order mixed up with my cousins. There wasn't one thing on the menu that she had ordered. The cake was the same way, it wasn't even close to what she wanted and she was obviously upset in the wedding photos. She finally got over it and the fun started, the food turned out to be very tasty so all ended well. We danced until we were bone tired.

I had a tree that was dying and in danger of falling in my front yard.  I have been told sometimes these dying trees are referred to as 'widow-makers' because they have been known to fall over on a whim and cause fatal accidents.  After learning that, I decided the safest thing to do would be to chop it down preemptively.  I used a chainsaw and this was my first time using this tool as well as my first time cutting down a tree.  Well, I learned my lesson because the tree fell down in the wrong direction and almost killed me anyways.  The one thing I was trying to prevent in the first place.  This came as a total shock because I did not even consider this being a possibility to watch out for.  I should have watched a youtube instructional video first!  As usual, I thought I could handle anything and did not need to research such a ""simple task"" before hand.  I was wrong. I always expected my life to flash before my eyes in an event like this.  However, this was not the case because it all happened so fast.  The dang tree almost was a widow-maker after all.

Later, we went to the hotel and dressed up nicely for the show, then walked to the theater since it was walking distance from our hotel.  The play was bustling and exciting, and we all enjoyed it very much.   The next morning, we visited the zoo and saw many different animals.  My son's favorite are always the wolves, and his friends enjoyed seeing the penguins and the polar bears.  At the zoo, we had lunch at a cafe.  At the end of our zoo visit, we were all hot and tired, and stopped for cold drinks and ice cream.  After our drinks, we piled into the car for our drive home.  It was about a three hour drive.

In the car, I kept saying we should have kept all of this in the car in case this happened! Susan wasn't thrilled, but took it better than I did. We got the things and went to the hospital. We waited for the longest time to get helped by someone. We eventually called our doctor and  he sent information down for us. We got our room and then the issues really started. She was in labor and despite everything, she wasn't progressing like she should have been. We were there 15 hours before the doctor said she was going to need a c-section. I fought against it and so did Susan. We wanted a natural birth! The doctor urged more and we ended up allowing it. It was stressing Susan and the nurses all said that stress was the last thing that she needed. In the end, everything worked out really well and Josie was born health and happy!",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8EOKUXU,0.0

This trip was extremely memorable to me because we both decided to pack a weekend bag and book plane tickets at the last minute which made the trip all that more adventurous. We ended up booking the hotel while we were at the airport and decided to stay at the Grand Floridian Resort and Spa which is on Disney Property. We were able to go to Disney Springs, Magic Kingdom, and Epcot while we were there. When we went to the Magic Kingdom I surprised my girlfriend with dinner and private viewing of the fireworks. When We went to Disney Springs we made a point to stop and eat at a restaurant called Planet Hollywood. We ordered two milkshakes and we were both surprised that the milkshakes were so large. I had an entire piece of cheesecake on top of mine while she had an entire lollypop with cotton candy and many other small delicious treats. When we went to Epcot on out final full day of visiting Walt Disney World we had the best day full of many fun memories and pictures to look back on. We tried different types of food from around the world while also getting to do a lot of shopping and buying several different cultural items. Later that night we went on the test-track which is her favorite ride offered at any of the parks so I made sure to get fast passes for it. We then decided to go to the Canada Pavilion and watch the laser and firework show. This was one of the last times the show would be running because Disney was soon going to update it. Overall, the trip was filled with excitement and fun. This is a trip I will remember for the rest of my life and I am so happy I got to spend it with my girlfriend. The day after we flew home with big smiles on our face and couldn't wait to go back.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQBUXQ,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8FQBUXQ,0.0

I fought back. I defied their rules and systematic behavior. My parents wanted to raise me to be super religious, but I wasn't feeling it. They insisted they wanted me to follow my own path. That was a commendable thing for them to do. But it certainly didn't stay that way. I thought they were going to be supportive of me, but then they do a complete reversal. They deliberately shut me out of their life. They went back on their word. The two people I thought I could trust, I couldn't trust anymore. I was disowned for not wanting to be manipulated into something I didn't believe in. I am in awe at the stance they took. They took belief in someone that wasn't their own child.

I live several hours from my parents and siblings so we only see each other a couple times a year. It was my niece's birthday and also near the 4th of July so it was a good time to take a trip back home to see everyone. I spent the night before my drive taking care of errands around my apartment and then packing for the trip. The next afternoon, I left work a bit early and started the drive back to my parents' place. I arrived a couple hours of driving to find my brother had already arrived. I pulled into the driveway, shut off my car and got my suitcase out of the car and walked up to the front door. The front door was locked so I went around to the garage door and was going to use the keypad to open it when the front door opened and my dad was there. I smiled and gave him a hug as I walked into the house. I saw my mom and brother talking in the kitchen so I dropped my stuff off on the ground and went over to say hi. After a brief round of greetings, I went back to put my stuff into a spare bedroom where I would be spending the next two nights. I put my stuff in the room and headed back downstairs after plugging my phone into the wall to start charging. I got back downstairs and saw my parents and brother were discussing dinner options. We were going to meet my sister and her kids at a local restaurant for dinner and we were trying to figure out a time that worked. My sister mentioned a time she was available and we headed out to the restaurant to see everyone. We showed up a bit early, but after about 5 minutes my sister pulled in with her kids. I said hi to my nieces and nephew before giving my sister a hug and we walked in to get some food. We ordered our food and sat down at a table and had a good time reminiscing about old times and talking about how our lives were currently. We ate some delicious food and had an overall good time. After about an hour my sister needed to put the kids to bed so we went our separate ways. It was great getting to see everyone again and it was a wonderful night.",3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJESFZUT,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJESFZUT,0.0

I had a friend who struggled with doing just that. we weren't really friends at first it took time to connect. Our relationship started due to them not being able to budget correctly. So I was able to help them out with that. Due to my patience and advice it sparked a little friendship between us. Even after giving them advice I prayed for them to get help and learn how important it was to budget and save. I was grateful and joyful once we became friends.

But i gave her my number to ask for cheaper prices. Days went on and no call from her but then i receive call from her and she said you thought i forgot about you. I was so happy to hear from her because it was a time i needed savings. She told me i don't usually call random people but because i ask nicely she felt my help and need. The couponing relationship between us was very distance because she was always busy. So for awhile i prayed again for help because things were going down hill. Then my joy return she meet with me give lots of coupons and a lot of advice. My prays was answered instantly and i was so grateful for her coming through for me.

She and her hubby and me and hubby met on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. We spent a full and amazing week together! Despite the fact that it rained every single day, the four of us were so happy to be spending quality time together. We usually get together once a year, for the past 19 years, but recently illness has kept us from doing so. Therefore, this particular get-together was extra special! We were all healthy enough to enjoy the week. Sure, we all has a few more pills to take, as well as daily therapy-type exercises, than our previous get-togethers. But even through the aches and pains of aging, the week was fabulous. Some of the activities we did were: going to the beach, eating at local low-country restaurants (shrimp and grits... yeah!), attended a bon-fire at our villa, played bingo (woo-hoo... two of us won!), went ""house-hunting"" (looking at model homes is a favorite past-time whenever we get together), and especially just chit-chatting and catching up with life! One day was spent souvenir shopping for the grandkids. How fun was that? We helped each other choose really special gifts. (The 5 grandkids LOVED them all!)Even though it rained every single day, we had an awesome time. (The weather forecast was NOT accurate!) As always, this week was a special and memorable time that the four of us will not soon forget! I cannot wait till next year's get-together!",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MPWNNSL,0.0

This is an activity that we do on a fairly normal basis, however this time was a bit more eventful than usual.  My brothers girlfriend had a bit too much to drink.  Nearing the end of the trip, she jumped out of the kayak to get wet and cool off, however when the cold water hit her, it amplified her intoxication.  After this moment, the fun began.  After getting her kayak swamped for what seemed like 30 times, I was completely exhausted.  It took over an hour to complete the final quarter mile of the trip.  Upon returning to the take out point, I was nearly completely powerless.  All I wanted to do was to get out, go home and go to bed.  To this day, she does not remember the incident.  We have been kayaking numerous times since then, however event have not repeated.  They have been standard trips, thank goodness.  Nevertheless, it was a memorable trip.  It is a funny story that we tell often, especially when out on the river with friends.  Sometimes the craziest things make a lasting impression!",,3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ3BJ7A6,0.0

Now I have a 3 month old.  I went into the doctor because I was having back pain. They decided to keep me overnight just to be cautious. When I woke up in the morning they told me I was in labor. I couldnt believe it. I spent the whole day in mild discomfort and after 26 hours i was ready to deliver. I was surprised to deliver a healthy baby boy at 6 lbs 1 oz. I didnt know my little man was ready to come out. My husband couldnt believe it either. We had to quick buy more baby equipment as we werent quite prepared a month out. Being a mother is hard work but overall rewarding. I am not getting a lot of sleep and feel a bit disjointed but we are doing our best. We will love our son every day of our lives. I still cant believe that his happened so early!,,3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ5SD7A0,0.0

It was an unusual fogy morning. I was running late for work and I was in a rush for the meeting that I had at 9 am with my boss. I was driving kind of fast and when I was crossing the train tracks I got stock and my car would not move. I was terrified because there was a train coming my way. I was trying to start up the car but it would not. Then I tried to open my car doors but it would not open. The train ended up hitting a back of my car, sending me flying down the road, thankfully there were no other cars. At that moment the time literally stopped for me. I have seen life flashing through my eyes. Then it went black and I found myself later in a white room with bright lights. Thankfully I was not hurt that bad. But the experience was definitely devastating. It made me to rethink my whole life. It gave me a new outlook on everything around me. Life became more precious to me. I did not even realize how I was coasting through life without a real purpose and was not taking a full control of my life circumstances. I was not living a life, I was on automatic every day, chasing the wrong thing. That was the day when I truly became aware of myself.",,3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ5SJ7A6,0.0

We did not in fact go bankrupt. Instead the doctors and hospitals all wrote off the remaining balances. We should sue them all. That is why they chose not to pursue collections against us. They know if we go to court they will lose. Unfortunately my son is an adult and this is not left to me to decide. We would be going to see a lawyer if it were up to me. Needless to say. He is well and that is the important thing. I imagine years down the road he may regret it. But just like all his lessons he like to learn them the hard way! So at this point we owe noone anything for the hospital stay. We are just grateful he is ok. The surgery that started the whole debacle was a complete failure.

He was preparing to move to a city that was about 100 miles away from where we live. This was the first time he was to be away from home and on his own. Because my son has Asperger's syndrome, I have spent my whole life advocating for and protecting him. As I prepared him to leave, I realized that I would no longer have any any control over that anymore. As a last ditch effort to be useful, I took him shopping and bought him all that I thought he would need to be prepared to be on his own. I also took a lot of time to explain to him things he would have to remember to do and take care of. I was anxiety ridden and I thought about how he would get along without me. I worried that something bad would happen to him. The night before he left, I could not sleep. That morning, I tried to hold back tears as we packed up all his belongings into my car and prepared for the trip. The whole drive I lectured him on safety. I know that he got tired of listening to me and I worried he tuned out. I reminded him of the importance of keeping clean and respecting his roommates.  When we pulled up to his new apartment, I put on a smile and brave face even though I was torn to pieces on the inside. My stress levels were through the roof even as his excitement was abounding. We moved him in and he was in a hurry to rush me out the door so that he could begin his solo journey. I was totally crushed.

My father used to be a fairly healthy person. While he could have improved his diet, it's not like he was constantly eating fast food or anything like that. But, he works a very stressful job which has only gotten more stressful over the past year. My mother and I noticed that it seemed like he was getting out of breath more easily, and it seemed like his skin was always very red. After a few months of noticing this, we suggested that he should see a cardiologist. He's so stubborn, though, that he didn't finally make the appointment until 2 weeks ago. When the results came back, we were stunned, but not particularly surprised. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure and they think he has a blood clot. They scheduled surgery for next month, and the entire family is very stressed out at the thought. My father has been forced to quit working temporarily in order to not aggravate the condition before the surgery. We are all very nervous because the surgeons told us there is a somewhat significant chance the operation could kill my father. In addition, because my dad hasn't been working, it's been up to me to financially support the family in the mean time. I asked my boss to give me extra hours, but there was only so many they could give me so it's been a bit rough. I thought about selling some of my stuff, like my extra monitors and computers, but I can't bring myself to do it. I'm just praying that the operation goes well so we can live our lives as a happy family again.",,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCNFH32R,0.0

I usually use my skills in research and charge bounty hunters for me to find them; I can usually make maybe 15 to 30 bucks in 15 minutes doing so.  I took advantage of the laws In this state licensed PI's can purse bounty hunting if they wish. This case is a one and a million opportunity. ""This is an old fish story you hear in the bar from old men who have story's that get better every hour"". I heard-about from a banker who was a personal friend of the ""skip""(Person Wanted), who faced termination because he did not follow procedure in advising his friend and let him take out a second mortgage on his home.  The next step in the process was to see if i could find him; I use a data mining tool that scans social media tool all at once for mentions and acquaintances. Using my own technique i was able to get a general idea of his location but this was-like trying to find a needle in a haystack.  I was lucky to find one the first person i talked to. This was unique because it usually takes talking to 10-15 people to find someone that either knows them; and is willing to give them up. The problem was that I was alone; when i did do bounties it would usually be for something little like skipping out on a DUI or simple possession. Within minutes i made the decision to go in and I would cuff him right when I saw him. Since i was alone and i considers him dangerous I had 911 on my phone ready to go. When I walked in I scanned the hall and saw him sitting at a table this was it. In my head I was concerned""is that really him or is my head playing tricks on me"". If I arrest the wrong person I am looking at a false imprisonment charge. Then I saw the tattoo in his lower left wrist and knew it was him. I walked right up to him and cuffed him while he was still sitting down. After taking him in I was awarded 37K which made my summer. I was struggling work was slow this summer and I would make on average 90 # a day or so.",,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCO2023K,0.0

I like to go go-cart riding. It's really fun and relaxing and kind of thrilling to time a turn right. Well, I drove my go-cart over to the track which was a mistake but I don't have a car that it fits in. I had a couple nice rounds on the track and it was a really pretty day but then my gas line started to leak which was dumb because I just did a whole bunch of maintenance on my cart and should have caught if the line was bad. But the gas got everywhere! I got it all over my hands and my pants. I should have known to clean it up too after I reattached the line but I wasn't thinking and just started the cart back up. IT CAUGHT FIRE. It was so awful! I had to jump out of the cart so I didn't catch fire and run for the fire extinguisher. I managed to get it out okay and nothing on the track got damaged but my cart was ruined. My gas line was warped and important parts of the motor were completely melted. I think the owner of the track felt really bad for me because he agreed to store the cart until I decided what I wanted to do with it, try and repair it or just scrap it for parts. A new cart is so expensive though. I still don't know the answer to that one. But then I was kind of stuck. I didn't have my phone on me so I couldn't call someone for a ride and I certainly didn't have a go-cart to ride back home in. So I had to walk. I didn't even realize how far away the track was until I just had to huff it on foot. It's far! Like, at least five miles. It took me a whole hour to get home and I was exhausted. So I was out a go-cart and winded from the walk. I basically just played video games for the rest of the day to make myself feel better.",,3VA45EW49O90SE861H505XEISP91OT,0.0

He has been my pet for almost 13 years now and has always been a great companion. He is always waiting for me at the door when I come home from work, he loves to brush up against me and show affection, and he has the sweetest meow. When I first adopted Fluffy, he was already missing one eye, but it never really seemed to bother him. He got around about as well as I expect any cat would, and his disability didn't seem to bother him. I loved him all the same. However, one day I noticed that he seemed to have trouble navigating around; he was more cautious, wasn't as accurate in his jumping abilities, and occasionally would run into an object. I didn't notice anything obviously physically wrong with him, but I decided to take him to the vet to see what was going on. The vet gave me some bad news: Fluffy's vision in his one remaining eye was deteriorating and the cause was ocular cancer. The doc gave me two options -- we could remove Fluffy's remaining eye to prevent the spread of the cancer, or we could do nothing but monitor the situation. In the first case, Fluffy would be totally blind, but in the second, he may only have several months to a year before the cancer spread and took his life. I was devastated and told the vet I would have to think about it. He said he would respect whatever decision I made, but if we were to operate, it should be done as soon as possible. I went home and thought long and hard about the decision. I didn't want to take away Fluffy's one remaining eye and plunge him into a world of sightlessness, but I also couldn't stand the thought of losing my wonderful companion of so many years. In the end, I couldn't deprive my cat of such a vital sense as his sight. Although it may prolong his life, it seemed more like a selfish demand on my part. The vet said he likely wouldn't suffer much, and that we would check up on him frequently to see if he was in any pain. If the time came when he was suffering, I would try to do right by my furry friend and ensure his passing was painless. It has been two months since I made my decision, and I still question whether I'm doing the right thing. I try to spend as much quality time as I can with Fluffy and enjoy him without thinking about the inevitable future. Time is so precious to us living things, and it must run out some day, but in the meantime Fluffy is still the cat he always was -- if a bit slower -- and so far his cancer hasn't spread. I hope that our time together is as long as possible. I will always treasure him being in my life.",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPGD7SG2,0.0

My wife is ten years older than I and had been a child bride after being raised in a cult.  When she broke free doing so meant losing her children, and four of the five that she lost have come back into our lives after she had missed them for 17 years.  She was able, because of their return, to be there when her eldest child proposed to his girlfriend and began wedding planning.  She is excitedly buying things for the wedding but I know how much the hole in the timeline that their absence made will never quite fill.  I know that she will always miss the time that she missed with them and all the memories that she would have made over the years with them, but seeing her excitedly bustle and plan and be filled with joy as she plans to watch her son, her first baby, be happy is sometimes a bit overwhelming to me.  I am so happy for her and yet fell so badly for the pain she is still in.  It is admittedly strange watching the kids blend together, as she had one child with a subsequent partner and then later two with me.  Eight kids, and seven of them are regularly in our lives.  it is chaotic, and funny, and sweet, and scary.  Seeing the ways that the kids are all the same and yet so diverse is neat.  It is often strange realizing that my eldest stepson is only 8 years younger than I am.  It is shocking to others that we are already grandparents, though our son doesn't have contact with his daughter.  I wish that I could help them more, with their challenges in life.  I hope that I am doing enough to support my wife while our family makes these transitions.  I am certainly trying.",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13GS8,0.0

He had just lost his job. It could not have come at a worse time. We were just hours away from closing on the the property and start the house building process. One of the smart things that we did was pay cash for our property. So losing the property was not even on the horizon. It was ours, but it would delay us from actually building our home. So there we were homeless. We had a home, but not a brick and mortar home. Not one that was stable. Or so we thought. We took this opportunity to travel with our boys. We had a bit of a savings and decided that we would travel. Our home had wheels and we could take it anywhere with us! We saw parts of the country we had never seen. Stayed in places we would have never stayed in if it was not for him losing his job. We woke up to some of the most stunning sunrises and went to bed with the absolute gorgeous sunsets.

It was the first time my boys got to meet their favorite Sesame characters! I will never forget the looks on their faces when they saw Elmo. It was like they saw a celebrity! He was part of the parade and walked right over to us. At first my son, Theo, was a little shy. I don't think he expected the characters to be so big! He was a bit hesitant and slowly put out his hand for a handshake. But then, once Elmo grabbed his hand, Theo went in for a big hug! We got great photos. It was the best! They also got to meet other characters like Cookie Monster, Grover, and Big Bird. They enjoyed going on a few kiddie rides too. We also spent some time in the water park. Their joy and excitement is something that will always stay with me. I'm so glad we got to share this experience!",3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSC4YT8F1,3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSC4YT8F1,0.0

I was working a job in a call center as customer service rep.  My shift I worked was at night and I enjoyed it very much.  There were a few drawbacks to the job though.  One was cellphone restrictions due to sensitive data.  I missed being able to listen to music and do work all at the same time.  We were not allowed to use anything wireless like ear buds or anything else that was related to those type of products.  Once I put in enough time at the company I decided to transfer out to another position.  I had to put in about 30 applications but I finally got two interviews lined up.  I was so excited and nervous that I may not get the position but I really needed it.  Luckily I got the call one day and they were asking me if I would accept the welcome letter and I did.  It was the best day In almost two years.  My job has been so rewarding and I love what I am doing now.  I get to learn something new everyday and interact with new people all the time.  No more sitting on the phone all day long now I am able to enjoy my life a little.,,3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSCBBVF87,0.0

It was my only choice. We decided to take our travel trailer and park it in the free parking area for trailers and motor homes. I use to work at this hospital and it was a little known fact that this was available. We got there and got set up and went to the security office to get registered. They said they required our trailer registration and our vehicle registration. We had spoke to them twice on the phone about coming and they had never mentioned this. I had to leave an see my doctor about tomorrow's surgery. So my husband attempted to take care of it. Security said there was something wrong with the registration and called the cops. So, once the cops came the cops got it all straightened out. The cops were irritated with security. So after my doctor appointment and getting our trailer registered, we went back to the trailer. There was a motor home already parked there it had many loud dogs barking in it and there was a large pile of smelly garbage in back of the trailer. There was also a trail of garbage leading back to a large creek. We called security to report the mess and danger of bear activity on the premises. Nothing ever happened. So after my surgery I reported this to some former co-workers, who were now supervisors, The mess got taken care of right away.",3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540O51FU,,0.0

I was kicked out of that college at the end of the Fall 2018 semester, and had been missing them for a good few months. At first all went well, and we hit it off with some ordered pizza and video games. Things got strange mid-way through, however, and the student that I was visiting started acting strange. He began to get uncomfortably close, and started making inappropriate gestures and comments. These gestures included kissing my hand, cuddling me unprompted, and saying strange things about me and my body. I spent that entire night trying to distract myself from the situation, knowing that I wouldn't be able to go home until morning. I could barely sleep that night, and spent most of that night talking to one of my online friends to try to keep myself calm. She agreed that the situation was strange, and that I was right to feel the way I did. When the morning came I covertly called in my ride home, pretending to be asleep until she would arrive. The student didn't wake up until late, so I was able to slip out of the dormitory building undetected with all of my belongings packed. The ride home was awkward, and I made no attempt to tell my ride why I called her in so early in the morning. I was just happy to be out of the situation, despite deep down feeling conflicted and sad. After I got home from the ordeal I laid down for a bit, and thought about the situation thoroughly, trying to find something to make sense of it all. For that entire day I ghosted the student, not answering any of his messages or making any attempt to reach out to him over the situation. I felt filthy, and to say that I was depressed for that period was an understatement. When I finally did gather up the courage to tell him how I felt, I had to force the confrontation out of myself.  He apologized, and said that he wouldn't do it again. He said that he agreed he felt his actions were wrong, and in the heat of the moment. However, that was not the end of his behavior in that way, and I spent more months talking to him and subjecting myself to his treatment. That event is the central event that made me question whether or not he was really my friend, and whether he considered me an object instead of a person. I have sense blocked him on all forms of social media, and make no contact with him whatsoever.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3540PCF1H,0.0

I was subpoena by both the state and the mother which I believe was unusual. The mother was expecting to be able to influence how I would testify but I explained to the judge's clerk that she was trying to influence me.  The judge held a hearing to verify that I intended to honestly testify about the case. During the hearing the judge admonished the defense and sent the case to arbitration prior to hearing the full case.  During the arbitration period the defense and the state negotiated a custody agreement that did not remove the mother's rights permanently. The surprise was that the mother agreed to give rights to my friend who is the great-grandmother and list me as the backup if my friend is unable to care for the child due to a health condition which flares up regularly.  I was totally amazed to receive custody of a 4 year old boy who is not related to me. It has been difficult at times because the child has behavioral issues due to abuse and the drug environment which his mother was raising him in. The rewards of watching him heal and starting to grow into a normal child is very rewarding and provides a fulfillment in my life. I retired earlier this year and had planned to spend it doing many activities which did not include being involved in raising a child again. I have become involved in arranging therapy, doctor's appointments, preschool, etc. This is not how I planned for my retirement be but I have decided that this will be just as rewarding as raising my children was. I have adapted my plans and others have stepped up to help me so that I can still do some of the travel that I had planned to see my own family.

He really had a great time and there were a lot of kids who showed up, which was nice. There were even some who showed up who didn't even RSVP, which was great, because we were sort of sad that my kid's friends wouldn't all be there to celebrate with him. My wife had bought WAY too many presents, naturally. I spent the day setting up all the tents outside, so we would have room for everyone. It was supposed to rain that day, but we lucked out and it turned out really nice. My son had a blast with all his friends at his house. He was very excited to show them all his toys and we really didn't have any conflicts over them, which is rare. It was so hard to tear him away from his friends to actually sit down and participate in his own party! In the end, his friends were the ones to actually convince him to come and eat cake. He loves chocolate cake a lot too. We had one made with some characters from a TV show he likes, which was a great surprise for him. He tore into his cake too, really enjoyed it and made a mess everywhere which was ok, since we were outside. The dogs had a good time cleaning up the cake and ice cream afterwards too.

We bought him a chocolate cake and a few toys. When he first saw the cake after we put it on his high chair tray he didn't know what to think. He just stared at it. Then he poked it and licked his finger. After he got a taste of the chocolate, he then picked up the whole slice and looked at it and then took a bite. He took a few nice bites like that and then it was a smash fest! He started smearing and smashing the cake all over his high chair. After a few minutes of that he started to look miserable and full. We tried to clean him up but it was impossible. We had to give him a bath because there was no way to clean him otherwise. After the bath he opened presents. At first he just wanted to play with the wrapped presents and the bows. Once we showed him how to tear the paper, he tore off one little piece and was content to play with that. We had to help him open the presents or he would have never opened them. He liked the wrapping and paper better than the gifts!",3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354PCA1F0,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354PCA1F0,0.0

It was a lot of work unpacking and taking care of the property but it was well worth it in the end. We now have a stall to put our horses and the meadows and vast scenery is beautiful. My wife's horse Bessie passed away earlier today so we buried her on the farm and had a funeral for her. Right now I am working on building chicken coops so we can get hens for eggs and I am planning on placing ducks in the pond out back so I can get duck eggs.  We plan on raising our own eggs and beef cattle so we can avoid paying high prices for groceries.  Everything is good despite a tragedy that occurred on the farm two weeks earlier in the pigpen.  My sister went out to the pigpen one night to feed the pigs.  I woke up in the morning and she was nowhere to be found. I went to the pigpen and found nothing but bones and a few teeth.  The pigs had eaten my sister.  I didn't want to deal with the police so I buried her bones in the meadow and had a memorial. This gave me an idea. I was tired of my wife running around and cheating on me with every man in town and I thought about killing her for awhile but I was worried about getting caught. If I killed her and fed her to the pigs they would eat her, bones and all and the police would never find out what happened to her. I am deciding on a day and time when to kill her and how I am going to kill her.  I will keep you updated next diary entry.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354X6A1FW,0.0

More often than not, her idea of fun varied from what we find appealing. She is a wildcard and a little too much at times, as are her friends. But once we got to the beach our attitudes changed. The night itself was perfect. The sun was just setting and cast an orange and red light over the water and horizon. There were more people than expected, but it was different than what I was prepared for. Instead of drinking heavily and listening to loud music the crowd was casually conversing with each other. Eventually a bonfire was started. Having grown up making bonfires with our family, it brought back so many good memories. My Father showed us how to roast the perfect marshmallow. My mother joked about ""cheating on her diet"". And my sister for once didn't present herself as the party girl. Instead she was a mature, happy version. An improved version. A version we could all relate to. In a way it was a grown up version of who we were as children. We ended the night laughing while make smores and listening to the waves. It was a perfect family evening.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI354ZMUF1S,0.0

They are an older band (from the 80s) and every time they tour, they never quite make it to my area, so I was quite excited to see them! Unfortunately, I had to go alone, so the build-up to the show was kind of dull/anxiety laced, as I had no one to talk to until they played the show. I was a bit irritated since initially my boyfriend said he would go with me, but ultimately admitted that he didn't want to go due to not really enjoying the kind of music this band plays. I was frustrated because while I didn't want him to go and have a bad time, I also didn't want to be completely alone in a room where everyone has someone else to talk to and be with. I tried my best to get over the feeling of being notable alone as I made my way to the event and stepped inside. As I try to do when I really like a band, I finagled my way as close as I could to the front of the stage, where I eventually got to the very front and held on to the barricade for dear life! The crowd all pushed forward and I watched so many grown adults like myself get way too close to one another, sweating and spewing out face paced lyrics like we wrote them ourselves. It was such a happy experience for me, the connection of strangers through music that we all really love. The bad interacted with the crowd as well and that is always a great thing to be a part of! By the end of the concert, I was very sweaty, dehydrated, my makeup was smeared and my hair was highly questionable. I felt similar to how I felt so long ago as a teenager...Alive, a part of something. Together with others, unified by something greater than us as individuals. A sort of familiarity despite not actually knowing one another. As someone who grew up in a broken home, this kind of feeling is very rare and highly sought after.",,3VFJCI1K40L0T6QPBS776FNTEYIGRQ,0.0

What if she gets injured? Or sick? How quickly can I get to Connecticut from Chicago in an emergency and limited income. Thank god for Facetime. My favorite part of drop-off was either making up her bed (her roommate also had a purple color scheme!) and unpacking her or meeting all of the program staff. She has a corner room in a building from the mid 1800s and NO air conditioning. I am so glad we brought those fans. I love that she's in such a beautiful setting, but man it is going to be hot in there! I am so proud of my myself that I managed to not shed one single tear when I said my goodbyes. I knew if I cried, she might cry, and I had to be strong for her. She is on the first adventure of her life, on her own, and she isn't even 12 yet. Only six weeks to go! I know I can do this.

We were both at work the 1st Monday in July after the holiday, she was kind of down and not herself, but I attributed it to her having to be back at work. We left for the night and had sent several text messages through the evening. Upon waking up on Tuesday I noticed that there were strange posts on her Facebook from other people, but nothing specific. I readied myself for work and made the 45 minute commute. As soon as I got in the office people were giving me weird looks and I knew something was up. I casually asked if she had called in already since her car was not in the lot. My boss, who is a very no nonsense man asked me to come into his office. I thought I was being fired or something. As soon as the door was shut behind me, he simply said xxx is dead, sorry. Those were his exact words. I thought he was kidding, and sat there in shock for several seconds before he asked me if I was ok. No I am not ok. I have to find out from you of all people, and how you tell me is simply she's dead, sorry? He would not let me leave work, so I called my husband to drive up and literally take me home. I left my car there for over a week, too distraught to get it. Her death was so unexpected, and so preventable. I look back and know she was not herself and that is what haunts me to this day.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDAD3TOX,,0.0

He chose a Minecraft backpack which was pretty surprising to me because I didn't realize that he liked it so much. It was really cute though to learn about what he likes. I kept thinking about how much I had left to do, I need to get him a haircut and clean the house and attend all sorts of school meetings. I'm still really excited though. We are a couple of weeks out, now. I feel like that time will definitely pass quickly. Hopefully I can keep track of my to-do list and get it all done.

The most memorable part about this birth was how difficult and dangerous it was for my wife and daughter. My wife struggled very hard to push our daughter out. This was surprising and concerning because this is her sixth child so she obviously knows what she's doing. On top of this, it turned out the umbilical cord was wrapped around our daughters neck. So as my wife struggled to push the cord would constrict around our babies neck and her heart rate would plummit. This made everything very complicated and stressful. As time went on they prepped the operating room for an emergency C-section and told my wife she only had a couple more tries at natural birth. My wife had an emergency C-section on her first child many years ago so even this solution was dangerous. There was no real easy way forwards but my wife was determined not to have another C-section. something finally gave way and our baby started moving. They used a suction cup on her head to help the process along. Once everything started moving they still had to get the baby out far enough to remove the umbilical cord from her neck. There was a tense couple of pushes and I just remember feeling worried for them both. At last they got the umbilical cord removed and everything went smoothly from there.  It all worked out in the end but the process of the birth was very uncertain and stressful.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,,0.0

They were generally pleasant to have and take care of, and they helped alleviate some of my loneliness while living by myself. One was named Pumpkin and had brown and white fur, and the other was named Pepper and had black and white fur. Pumpkin had died a few months previous, and so I was left with just Pepper. She honestly seemed happier living by herself in her cage, and would squeak at me happily whenever I grabbed some vegetables out of the fridge. One day, I had just woken up, and I heard some light murmurs from the other room. I walked over to the guinea pig cage on the kitchen counter top and saw Pepper lying on her side and squeaking lightly. I put my hand on her to pet her, and she wasn't really moving that much. I then put her on a towel and put her in my lap and petted her for a while. I had a feeling she was sick, but I wasn't going to be able to bring her to the vet since I had no money at the time. She murmured and squeaked a bit for a while, and she eventually stopped moving. It was really sad when she died, since she was a constant companion of mine for a few years. I ended up burying her at my mom's house in her backyard. I put a little grave marker up, bending a coat hanger into the shape of a P over the spot where she was buried. My friend and her boyfriend were there, and they actually surprised me by saying some nice words about Pepper after she was buried. The most memorable part of the experience for me was probably just seeing my little friend die and being there with her during her last moments. It was sad for me, but it was also nice to know that I was there with her at the end. She was just a little guinea pig, and I'm sure some would laugh at me for showing any kind of affection for a creature like that, but I considered her a friend. It's good to know that her body is now returning nutrients to the soil, where new grass will grow and new vegetables might grow as well, so that other creatures similar to her will be able to have their own things to nibble on.",,3VNL7UK1XG57VL7M4X6KO9OZ11GTFC,0.0

Me and my son went on a trip about two or three weeks ago and we went to Colorado for 4 nights. I was super excited to see my sister and my son was super excited to see his cousin. It was a whole lot of fun and we did a lot of activities while we were there. We went hiking with and without the kids. We went and drank and danced when we were by ourselves, but we went on a trail walk when we took the kids. Me and my sister participated in adult activities such as going to the bar and going to the arcade, which also had a bar. We went to eat a numerous amount of times and just enjoyed each other's company. On our vacation we did a lot of dancing and just lounging around. The most surprising thing that happened to me is that i developed a stye on my eye the day before our last day on our trip. My son did not pay me any attention the whole trip because he was so excited to see his cousin. They played all day and night and hardly went to sleep in fear of missing out on the fun times. We went to the mall and did a little bit of shopping and window shopping just to pass the time. Me and my sister rode to Denver with some friends one of the nights I was there and got a big gigantic airbnb. We cooked, listened to music and just vibed with each other that whole night. On the last day of our trip we took the entire group including the kids to lunch. Afterwards we went back to my sister's house and played board games and watched movies until we fell asleep.

I spoke with the manager and he said that there would be positions that would be opened soon so try your best and I would be evaluated.  I did more work than usual for a number of months to strive for a promotion. I helped more customers and took on more responsibilities. I worked in the office such as organizing inventory and organized store promotions.  When the time came, I got the promotion and was grateful.  It showed that hard work pays off and you will be rewarded.  Due to the promotion, I was able to move to a better apartment.  I also was able to afford a new car which helped greatly because I had to rely on taking the bus previously.  I had more responsibilties but I enjoyed it.  I worked with my staff to make the store better.  I instilled my work ethic into my employees.  My promotion gave me confidence to do my job the best possible.

Well...used to be. It was at the time. The craziest part of the whole experience was actually passing the fetus. The pain was some of the worst in my life, and i've been though some other shit in the past. I felt and saw it - it was kinda like something big going through me and then it was all over me. The size of my hand, literally. I was able to pick it up, move it, etc. Once the fetus came out, the pain reduced a lot, although it was still painful. It's crazy to think about even now.

I lived with my mother and two younger brothers. This was very upsetting for us as we don't have a lot of family or family friends in this city. My family eventually became estranged from one another. My youngest brother moved in with relatives in another state, my second youngest brother (a teen) became deliquent, and my mother went to live with a guy she was dating. I moved to a homeless shelter for youth on the other side of town in search of stability and greater opportunity for myself. I worked two jobs to be able to move into my first apartment. The apartment was apart of a transitional housing program/intentional living community. These are programs that not only provide housing, but they also provide support in other areas (education, family mediation, career opportunity and more). It wasn't an ideal environment that I wanted to be in, and I ended up isolating myself from most of my peers. The people I did get involved with were probably the worst social group that I could have chose. I began smoking weed and tobacco products daily. I began drinking and I tried other drugs also. I knew the risks, but at this point with no family and being forced to drop out of college, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to. Luckily for me, this phase was short-lived considering that most people get addicted to drugs/alcohol and never recover.",,3VNXK88KKD4D73KY6667FVQ9LS2V91,0.0

I like being out in the woods alone. I love the smell of the earth under my feet, as I feel my lungs fill up with fresh air. The smell of the trees fills my nostrils. This was a pine forest, so the smell was piney. As I hiked along the trail, I left them every once in a while to go off into the trees. I found a few areas that could be great to set up a tent. They were fairly flat, and there were not many rocks to clear away. They were far enough away from the trail to be quiet and private, but close enough to the main roads to run for help in the case of a bear attack. I'm kidding. Maybe not entirely kidding. There was even a little brook that ran past some of them that would be good for a dip. There's nothing like swimming in a clear, cold stream to refresh you on a summer camping trip. I loved my solitary walk in the woods.  I might want to go back and have a camping trip there someday soon.

In fact, we actually separated for 8 months a few years ago. We decided to give it another chance. We have two children and we invested enough time and effort in our marriage, along with love, that we thought it was worth not giving up. But, it still seemed we just weren't quite as connected and close and we should be at this point in our marriage. My husband travels for work often, so that has been a strain on us at times. So, I planned a very nice family vacation about 3 months ago. Even though our children would be with us, along with my niece and my daughter's boyfriend, I felt it would give my husband and I a chance to spend more quality time together. Our children are older, so they don't need constant supervision and can be left alone. I book a beach vacation, with our accommodations directly on the beach, with an amazing ocean view. I told my husband that we could spend some time on the beach together, just us. I wanted to take some nighttime walks on the beach, sit down at the ocean, talking and gazing at the stars. I also hoped we could spend quality time together on the beach during the day. We did go on our vacation at the beach. During this time, we took walks on the beach at night. We talked over our relationship, discussing the issues in our marriage. We sunbathed on the beach during the day, laughing and playing in the ocean together. It did let us get closer together. It was refreshing and needed time for us together. Some time away from the daily grind of live, spending some time together to reconnect and talk.",3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C7NZXXK,3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C7NZXXK,0.0

It was one of the coolest first dates ever because I knew nothing of how to play golf and they claimed to not know how to play, but little did I know they did. This place is located in Miami right in front Dolphin Mall. I remember we decided to take a break and we sat on the couch next to our booth. He leaned in and tried kissing me but I thought it was too soon so I denied him and we continued playing golf instead. We then ate some food and drank some drank and it got us talking about communicating a little more with each other. Me denying his kiss was kind of a good experience because it gave me a chance to see how he would react when it came to rejection. Honestly, he was totally cool about it and didn't take it to heart or thought that was it, date is over. So I really respected and honored that about him and his character because it shows me that he has patience. After top golf we hung around the place a little longer and just talked. I had to work the next day and so did he but I did not want to leave was not worried about work the next day. We talked for about 3 more hours and it was like 1 in the morning. I remember before I left he gave me the cutest cactus plant too. I still have that plant till this day and its the cutest most adorable gift ive ever gotten. Weve gone on other dates aside from that one but that one was by far the best.",3VW04L3ZLUSVCO7R91D3JJ9C866XXU,,0.0

I got there with 2 other friends he lives in a duplex apartment. The party was good we needed to bring alcohol with us so we ended up getting a keg. After that we got there and there were cars lined up down the whole street! My sister was there also and she is very entertaining. We went inside and greeted everyone. Half the people there I did not know at least but a lot I did. There were so many people there it was like several parties were going on in different areas of the  house and outside. I spent a lot of time wondering where the birthday boy was he was the birthday boy. Finally after a few hours we found him outside by the neighbor's house talking to a group of people. We found him and popped some birthday caps at him and put a cone on his head just playing around. The birthday boy loved the party and will always remember his 21st birthday and how many people showed up for it. No one else has had a party like that, that I know personally. This will probably always be the biggest and best party I ever went to. My friend was very excited to talk about it the next day so I know he had a great time.",,3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNEFOZXT,0.0

It all happened over the course of a few months where we would spend time playing video games with several of our mutual friends as we would play similar games to each other it was bound for us to spend time closely. Each time we would end up together one-on-one enjoying ourselves in popular games such as ""League of Legends"". Back in those days it was easy to mention life, mention our goals, aspirations and converse about what went on in the video game. There were times where we would spend the entire day just hanging around each other without the friends included. In due time we shifted away from spending time around mutual friends towards just being around each other constantly each and every day after work, school to hanging around in our calls playing, watching or doing normal stuff. It never entirely occurred to me that I would be interested in such a relationship where we were away from each other in person. An online relationship never necessarily worked in my mind but for this it felt this was the right stage of my life where I was open to the idea as long as it's with the proper person. In a matter of two months it was clear we wanted to be more than just friends to which we decided to be together. As time moved on, all the laughs, all the eventful times and even frustrating moments we enjoyed together it continued to last for what does seem like it will be the remainder of a lifetime. Each passing month grew into what would soon to be almost 2 years at around the year and 8th month marker. It was a lovely time where I'll never forget when we started to make plans which started with Disneyland and then other plans to just spend time at conventions with video games or other ideas. All of these ideas sparked an overwhelming desire as time moved on, with plans set in motion for months since we started to speak up until now it never really occurred how much we needed to be there in person. Eventually we set our eyes on a Christmas Disneyland getaway vacation since it was a lovely idea. It started to mold together until we finally had the plans set in stone. It was one of the most wonderful adventures that has graced me to come across in my entire lifetime. I'll forever cherish the memories of being with each other for the first time in person when we first saw each other out at the airport. How many tears of joy moments will a person come across in their lifetime? Not many for me but in those moments it makes life worth living for when I am able to move towards being closer with the person I love. The time at Disneyland was one of the most beautiful, captivating times that I'll forever treasure in my heart which led me to find that my true happiness was always here with me.",3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNFJGXZS,,0.0

It wasn't until I met my significant other years back that I came to this question with an actual answer. Our times have been splendid, we have fallen harder over the past 2 years and 3 months together with plenty of eventful times together. Over the summer it's been quite the lovely one with trips to Disney Land, others to different parts such as Seattle, Los Angeles, etc.  All of them were magnificent times that have paved the way for me to ask her to one day become my wife. After an eventful time at our conventions, a hobby we have involving gaming, comics, anime and more, we opted to go to California for a trip to an event called ""Anime Expo"". She's usually rather excited about this event due to the fact she can dress up as her favorite characters as do most others do as well. It's always a lovely time, the atmosphere is fantastic with all the people having a blast going around to booths, visiting voice actors and checking out merchandise halls. As usual we had quite the lovely time together, spent all of our time dressing up, going out as characters from series such as ""Darker than Black"" and ""My Hero Academia"" with lots of laughs, gifts and food to enjoy. Although we had lots of fun to share with each other I still had in store one more event after all was said and done. Typically we do go out to eat together so on that note we took a bus ride all the way down to a pier to enjoy the area, look around to gaze at the scenery and for me to be able to catch her off guard with a ring in a relatively quiet, calm area. She was completely taken aback from the ring, confused initially then started to cry as most would. Of course she did not expect it in the slightest but was more than happy to oblige with her own ecstatic joy reaching down to grab, hug me completely ignoring the ring as she says, ""Yes!"". Could not have been a happier event of our lives that leads me to the main questions that have bugged me over the years. Why do I live exactly? I live to make those around me happier and to find happiness with myself through others.",3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNFJGXZS,3VZLGYJEYMWKHJ76AJ1OG4PNFJGXZS,0.0

The love they have grown for each other and to be apart of this wedding and to be apart of a memorable day is amazing. They just go married May 12, 2019 the most gracious and amazing part was to hear their vows. The vows was so heart filled because to be close to them and to see the man her husband has molded into and grown into to be for his family. It just gives you so much happiness. The reception was also amazing her mother passed when we were kids so to see the happiness and memorials for her felt like she was there. We had such a great time we danced all night. The food was amazing and the decorations was just so beautiful her day was fit for a queen. The even better memory is they are expecting their 2nd child which is a soon. So to know they are doing it right this time and grown over the years is everything she deserves. The love in their eyes will always be amazing and a memory for my best friend because she is truly happy.",,3W2LOLRXLC15VSM81JSM47FM3J2KRQ,0.0

There was alcohol,  but I didn't drink any,  because I do not drink.  I never have and I never will,  most likely.  I didn't start then.   I didn't really interact with people,  either.  I found a spot in the back,  I sat back.  I observed,   I waited.    The thing about just observing and being quiet is that people draw conclusions.  They think you're smart just because you don't say anything,  they think you're contemplative.   That might be true for me.  The important thing is that the image draws in people who like contemplative people,  and I like people who like contemplative people.   So,  I waited for someone to come to me.   And someone did.     She was attractive,  and I listen to her,  let her take the lead.  That's important,  too.   I take her ideas and expanded on them,  rather than taking control of the conversation.  I explored what she wanted to explore,   that's one of the reasons we hit it off.   To be honest,  I would have liked to get to know her better,  but that's not what she was interested in.    I prefer long term relationships,  she wanted something immediate and short term.   I followed her lead in that regard. When she asked me to escort her home,  I did so.  When she asked me inside,  I accepted.

She was a tiny kitten named Pina Colada but I had nick named her Minnow because she was a small fish in a big pond.  She was a really sweet kitten but had been taken from her mother way too soon so had some issues eating.  She did pretty okay for the first few days and then went down hill.  I fed her electrolytes and special vet recovery food and she did well for a little bit but then she just didn't make it.  She ended up having seizures and dying a week later.   The vet said it was liver failure due to a defect and that we gave her the best life possible.  I cried so hard.  I know she was just my foster but she was the best kitten ever and I am glad to have had her in my life even if only for a few weeks.  I bought a statue to help memorialize her and to give myself some peace.  I never realized how hard it would be losing something that wasn't really mine to start with.  I plan on keeping the statue in the rescue room and using it as a memorial for all the babies that don't make it.  I don't want any of them to be forgotten just because of the circumstances of their birth.  I feel like everyone should do their part in animal rescue, and if you can't spay and neuters.

To celebrate my birthday and to for general relaxation I decided to take a vacation. I went to Saint Lucia for 10 days and 9 nights. This in and of itself is not out of the ordinary or remarkable, as I have done something to commemorate the date of my birth every year since I was born.  What was notable about this particular vacation was that it was the first time that I travel with a sex worker as a companion. I was a bit apprehensive about the idea at first. I did not want to a bad experience with someone who has a disagreeable personality. I am experienced in dealing with sex workers, but only on a short term basis i.e. a matter of hours. Also, I spent some time living in Saint Lucia during my childhood. This vacation was going to be nostalgic and had sentimental value to me and I did not want to spoil that. After much deliberation I decided to travel with a beautiful provider I have been working with for nearly two years now.  She has been quite lovely and professional through out the time that I have had the pleasure of working with her.  One of the things I enjoyed about her was that she was comfortable sharing the same bungalo at the resort. We made time to spend together and also had separate engagements. I even visited the town of Black Bay where I lived as a child.",3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0EF39H6,,0.0

First, I had to go a health science statistics class to deliver a presentation.  The presentation was a group project where we analyzed Wingate Test data.  I had done most of the project myself because I did not fully trust my group member, so I was quite nervous. Despite the problem, we did quite well, and it was reflected by the grade that we received later on.  However, at the time, I just knew that we stumbled a bit.  I then went on to a different building where I began to study for the more challenging task of the day - an anatomy practical and exam.  I had been studying ALL over the past week, which a much heavier emphasis on the prior weekend for these.  I needed a good grade here to maintain my 4.0 average (whereas my grade in my stats class was relatively safe).  I studied in this building from approximately 9:45 AM to just shy of 12:30 PM.  At this point, I headed up to the floor where my exams were and changed clothes (scrubs are a must in the anatomy lab).    After changing clothes, I went to the hallway just outside of the lab where classmates were starting to gather.  I sat down and studied just a bit more before the professors arrived.  Unfortunately, I did not make it into the first group of test takers (the practical only had around 10 stations and there were 16 students, so we had to be be split up).  This meant that I had to hang out in the hallway for a bit longer while the first group took exams.  While there, I studied and had a conversation with a girl about our dogs (we both have a dog named Darwin).  Finally, it was time for me to start the practical.  I went in, and had some uncertainties about a few of the stations that made me feel pretty miserable - I was certain that I was going to lose my A.  After the practical, we moved on to the written exam, where I was able to brood some more about my performance on the practical.  As I struggled through the exam (it was the hardest one yet), I just knew one thing - I was tired.  As I finished (with only one other student in the room), I slowly got up, walked to the teachers and turn in my exam before I left towards my car.

G felt that I was the one who was doing all the day to day helping with doctor's appointments and taking care of stuff at home. So the pasrt she felt she could best play considering she was rarely in our home state was to provide a trip to a warm place with a beach. This is exactly what D wanted. It was the first trip after D started treatment and it would just be the three of us. I felt lucky that this trip was provided by G. No matter what, it was going to be hard. I knew D atleast felt like she could be real about her frustrations and fears. When we arrived, it was truly the most luxurious place I had been in, which isn't important by itself. Obviously most people couldn't afford this and it's not the only way to deal with this diagnosis. But for three women who grew up not having access to this, it was pretty amazing. G wanted to place to be a surprise so only gave D and me the address but not the name of the hotel. Everything was made out of recycled material, the suite was stunning with a beautiful view. There were several pools to pick from as well as the ocean. Every night we would walk around town and pick places to have a drink. The memories of going on this trip are something I'll always be grateful for.",3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0EF89HB,,0.0

I completely was not expecting it at all. I guess he is more romantic than I ever gave him credit for. We were on a hike in Yosemite National Park which lasted all day. He brought some stuff with because we were going to have a picnic in the middle of the day and rest after hiking. We got the picnic set up and I sat down to eat. I noticed that he did seem a little different than usual. I thought he was just super excited to be in Yosemite. He told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. I was very thrilled to hear that. We then spoke about where and how we would like our wedding to be. We have plans to get married in Las Vegas in the near future. I am very happy that I went on the hike after all. That was my very first time being proposed to. It is a major event for me.

I live about 20 minutes away from The Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Tampa, FL. The buffet at the casino was having a menu special for the holiday, with a lot of Irish dishes such as shepherd's pie, corned beef and cabbage, and fish and chips. I had planned to take my parents to eat at the buffet since my dad's birthday was coming up. The plan was to go right when they open because it can get pretty busy during these special menu days. My father must have forgotten and had eaten a big breakfast in the morning so he declined to go, and my parents were out of the trip. Not wanting to waste the special menu day, I head over there to partake in the buffet special. The meal was delicious, from eggs benedict to prime rib and then fish and chips and I discovered I'm not a fan of corned beef. The meal was for free, as I was an elite member at the casino since I do gamble regularly. After I was done, I decided to head to the high limit area of the casino. I had won quiet a bit since the beginning of the year, and I had a pretty high bankroll. I start with around 1500 dollars and begin to play. I wasn't really looking to take any risk, but being full from the delicious feast, I decided to entertain myself and gamble a bit. It did not take long to lose all my money. Now I was on full tilt, frustrated with my enormous losses. Instead of walking out, I decided to make a withdraw of another 1500. Down another 500, I decide to try one more machine. After a few spins, I hit the bonus playing at 20 a spin. The bonus game is pretty unique with the multiplier of win line hits goes up after every free game. The thing that happened was when there was a 7x multiplier, I had a line hit for over 7000!! The bonus ended with almost winning 9500 which is my biggest jackpot every. I was very emotional, with shock and disbelief of what occurred. This was a gift, as it helped me pay down a lot of debt. I will forever remember this day, as it changed my life.",3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKB8MU75,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKB8MU75,0.0

I was walking home from my job as a bank teller at the local bank when the most horrible thing happened that I am still afraid to talk about, let alone write about.  I was about 3 blocks from my house when I was accosted by a group of very angry and aggressive black youths.   This is a rough part of my neighborhood so I was used to some aggressive behavior being a white male in a majority minority area but this day was different.  They were obviously inebriated and out for blood this evening.  The leader of the group approached me and called me all sorts of vile, racist names and asked me what the hell I was doing in their neighborhood.  I tried to reason with them but I could tell their as no appeasing them.  I still held onto hope I could get out of this situation unscathed until I was broadsided upside my head with a bottle. This was only the beginning of my nightmare.  I was than kicked and punched until blood was pouring down my face.  All I could do was curl in a ball and pray that it would end quickly.  I had little hope as they were too many and everyone wanted a turn on me.  Before I lost consciousnesses, one of the little bastards ripped my wallet out of my pants ripping the pocket and than spat upon me.  I wish this was the end but unfortunately no, they than proceeded to strip me naked.  After this I was hit with a heavy object and everything went completely dark. I awoke in the hospital with my fiance and mother crying.  I learned that my face was permanently disfigured and that I would need years of plastic surgery.  I now have and suffer daily from PTSD.  I am an agoraphobic and do not want to leave the house.  Because of this and my horrible disfigurement I believe my fiance wants to leave me.  Now, my only thoughts are concerned with revenge!!!",,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKMR47UD,0.0

It was a long drive and we stopped some place about 2 hours away for the night. We arrived right at lunchtime, but my sister and husband hadn't gotten there yet. They were coming from just across the state. So we had a little time to visit with my niece who I'll call N. We also got to meet her staff who works out of N's home. Once my sister (C) arrived we started to have lunch, but not before N took her mother's sandwich and hid it. She made C find it in the oven which was her way of telling her mom and dad that a new grandchild was on the way. Later we found out that N's husband (J) was working his last day for the major department store he worked for. They were restructuring and he was being laid off. But they weren't too concerned about that. We had a great time with everyone that evening. On Sat. we just enjoyed hanging out. N had a dinner party that evening with all of us and J's family.  Sunday was a sit around the pool and finish up the Sat. night leftovers. On Monday it was discovered that the septic system was having an issue. J called someone and we all took off for a little place that sold the best cinnamon rolls I have ever had.  When we returned the problem was fixed. Then is was Tuesday and time for us to head back.  Some other events were playing with some new kittens that N was caring for, watching a lot of TV geared to a 2 year old., visiting an outlet mall and having a SC low country boil dinner for my sister's birthday. It was a great few days and I'm looking forward to going again.",3WETL7AQWUUAU7G3J6NKKKTOZIN35L,,0.0

I got a call the next day to come back for an ultrasound  because they had found something that just didn't look right.  The ultrasound showed several masses in my left breast and swelling in my lymph nodes so next they wanted to preform biopsies.  I have 20 biopsies of different areas.  It was painful.  I had to wait 5 days for the results.  When they called to say the results were ready they wouldn't tell me them on the phone.  I had to come in person.  I knew that was not good. Even though I knew what to expect it was still so shocking to hear.  I started radiation for the cancer two months ago. I had previously completed five months of chemotherapy. It was exhausting having to go every day for my radiation treatments. By the time I finished going for five weeks I ended up with very sore and severe burns.  Between my chemo treatments and the start of radiation I had to have surgery and I chose to have a double mastectomy.  Recovering from surgery was painful and extremely emotional learning to accept my new body.,,3WI0P0II62EXHMGY926Z0UKWR9KDRR,0.0

He found out that I still lived here locally so he got in contact with me.  I received a phone call from him and we chatted for about an hour.  It had been a long time since I had seen him, at least going back to our high school days.  He went off with the military and I stayed here and worked locally.  When we met up for lunch it was like we had never separated.  We really hit it off.  He actually had a family now (after multiple divorces though I'm told).  When our meeting was finished we told each other that we should keep in contact more often.  We agreed to call each other at least once a month as to not drift apart again.  We also promised each other that we would visit during the holidays because he said that he was in the area most years to visit his family.  I felt really good that one of my best friends growing up was doing well.  Its nice having him as a part of my life again.  We call each other all the time now just to keep current on each other's lives.  In a few weeks I'm going out there to see him.

My son has flown once before this. It was our daughter that we have always been worried about. However, since I am a teacher, we decided to take advantage of my spring break and we took our kids to San Diego. My wife and I had not been to San Diego since our honeymoon 8 years before. It is one of our favorite cities and my wife as savvy enough to find a deal on the hotel we stayed at for our honeymoon. She happened to look on their website on Black Friday of 2018 and found it. That is part of what made it so memorable for us. We were nervous getting on the plane, but both of our kids were amazing! Our son was calm and relaxed and our daughter was so happy. Day 1 we went to Belmont Park ; we got these passes so the kids could ride the rides and play the games and they loved that stuff. Day 2 we spent the entire day at Sea World. The awesome thing about Sea World is that my wife found us another Black Friday deal where we got these meal passes , so we got free food from 1 of 7 different restaurants every hour! We ate our way through the shows and the rides and all the fun animals there were to see. My daughter was so happy being there. My son loved the rides there too which was cool to take him on since now that he is older, he can go on more and more rides. Day 3 we did the Wild Animal Park which has this cool tram that takes you through all the different exhibits like the rhinos and the giraffes and the hippos. My kids had a great time seeing all the animals there since our zoos here in WA don't really have many of those, let alone being that close up. We also got to ride in a hot air balloon there too! The kids thought that was amazing and so did my wife and I. Day 4 we walked around the boardwalk down there and saw some little shops and stores that we thought were fun. My wife and I love shopping a little stores like that and the kids toughed through it pretty well too. All in all, it was an amazing trip. Our kids were really good, really flexible, and really polite. My wife and I had an amazing time thinking about our honeymoon and watching our kids play and swim at the same hotel we stayed at 8 years prior, and we realized that if we give our kids the chance to have fun, they can prove all of our worries and doubts wrong.",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLFP28AW,3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLFP28AW,0.0

He and his friend were out drinking and came back late one night. Though we had already broken up at the time, Steve was still living at my house while he looked for a new place. It certainly made for an uncomfortable living situation. So apparently Steve lost his key and ended up pounding on the door and smashing the doorbell over and over. It startled me awake to say the least. When I opened the door I was shocked to find a bloody mess. Steve's friend was holding his hands over his face, as blood poured out onto the ground. They were hysterical and didn't even answer me at first about what the heck had happened. Evidently they had gotten into a fight in the parking lot over something trivial and my ex punched him in the face. What a good friend! It was clearly a broken nose that needed to be re-set, which was a bit above my pay grade as a trainee nurse. The house was absolutely covered in blood though, especially the bathroom where Steve's friend immediately went after coming inside. Knowing that I had to get up early for work, I had no choice but to clean all the dried blood up before I laid down to finish my now disjointed sleep.

One experience was when he came home late one night drunk, with his best friend. He comes in, slurring his words. I got out of my bed to see what was the problem. He and his friend were in the bathroom. As I walked into the bathroom, I prepared myself for the worst. Blood. There was so much blood in my bathtub. There were drops on the floor, too. I was thankful there wasn't any blood on the carpets in the living room. I was, after all, renting this unit. He tells me he punched his best friend int he nose and he broke it. I was in shock from seeing all of the blood, I didn't know how to react. He had a temper and did not have control over it when he was sober. Seeing the blood, a wave of memories washed over me. When he kept punching my room door to let him inside. He had made a hole into it. When he grabbed my face and shoved me into a wall. When he yelled so much at me, he was spitting. His friend accepted his apology and didn't even get angry and retaliate. He was a terrible friend. A terrible lover as well. I guess he got a good look at himself when he saw my face and all of the blood that he caused to shed. Shortly after, I had to clean the tub. It was almost time for work.",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLGDM8AT,3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLGDM8AT,0.0

This marks the third ceremony that I have attended in the past two years. The first was my oldest son's White Coat, and the second was my wife's ""Pinning"" ceremony for completing nursing school. My family has accomplished a lot in the past two years!! The White Coat Ceremony is somewhat of the induction into the Pharmacy School. I was very happy about this recent event because it meant my son, who at times struggled with school in general, made it in on his first attempt. The struggle was constant for him, but he worked hard and was very persistent through his journey. The whole family attended, my two other sons and my wife, plus grandparents, and uncles and aunts. The Ceremony was short but sweet. I kept thinking the whole time how happy I was that both of my Son's are on the path to a great and successful career. This lead to me thinking back to my journey with my education and career, its a journey that I did not want my sons to go through. I was married with kids at the age of 20, and it seemed like my life story had already been written. I was fortunate to find good work without a degree, and eventually I finished college in 2015. My son's are on a more stable track and I am so grateful to my wife who pushed them along in their journey. I never imagined that as such a young father, that my kids would already accomplish what I could never had dreamed. One day I hope they can experience something like this with their kids.",3WJEQKOXA9OBQAE5RY0I42UD38QA1O,,0.0

She didn't, and she didn't care. That was what surprised me most. She normally has such wisdom, and she should know better, but when it didn't match what she wanted, she ignored it. He's not that interesting. And, as it turns out, he's abusive and pretending not to be. Probably for dating points, which is sickening. And now I feel betrayed, you know? I just felt upset and angry that she'd bothered to ask me the question, to put that emotional labor onto me, to transfer the onus of saying no (instead of passively accepting ""yes"") and then just completely disregard it. I don't know what the point was. To pretend everything is okay? It isn't, and not even validating it, or pretending it isn't happening, is disrespectful.

Everyone agreed, and I cried happy tears knowing that this was going to be the best day ever. Cake testing was fun as well. Not to mention making decorations with my little sister who tends to be bossy. But we got through that. The rehearsal dinner was a hoot. Everyone showed up on time, and we rehearsed like it was the real thing. The dinner was delicious and I was ready to get married to my man. That night I cried happy tears knowing this was my future.

Thee months ago was the start of the truth but the story is even older by another four years. Our relationship was a long distance one spanning an entire ocean, time zones were a constant challenge but somehow it always worked. I was a college graduate with a Masters in Bio Engineering and se was a post grad working towards a career in medicine. We would speak twice minimum every week for at least ninety minutes and spend two weeks together twice a year, once in my hometown and once in hers. Most of the four years went on without a hitch but I could tell in the fourth things were changing a bit. Our phone calls became slightly shorter and a bit less detailed. We missed a few of our annual get togethers, we were pulling back a bit. I decided then that is was now time to make an extra effort to close that wide ocean separating us and took a dive. It took a great deal of effort and deep discussions with he in the six months leading to the wedding but still there was something off.  The wedding planning was smooth and very little went wrong. The week of the wedding or families were together and getting along well. The day of the wedding was perfect and we both agree we wouldn't want anything different. We opted out of a traditional honeymoon, well it was already a big logistical debacle anyway. Excited to begin our life we discussed our future and for me living away from my home that I have known for so long. Thats when I leaned the truth, she was not amazing. She was not a post grad student working towards a medical degree. She was once but not now, she is not amazing in that sense but she is my beautiful and loving wife. I am happy to say that together we have rekindled her excitement of achieving her dream of medicine and i will one day be married to a beast loving SUPER Amazing woman.",,3WMINLGALCPVDDO37VP2LYD4GZ1ACV,0.0

The pain was especially pronounced when walking up and down stairs. At first, I thought I must have overdone some recent jogging or hiking and that the pain would dissipate in a few days. However, after a couple of weeks the pain remained. I went to an acupuncturist whom I go to from time to time for pain relief, and she seemed to think it was arthritis. After seeing her, I was pretty down, thinking this knee pain was something permanent and a condition I would need to contend with for the rest of my life. I was especially grieving giving up hiking, as this is one of my favorite hobbies. I decided to get a blood test to rule out rheumatoid arthritis. The blood test came back inconclusive, so I went to see a rheumatologist. He did think the pain was due to arthritis. He said I had three options: (1) take a biologic for the symptoms, (2) get surgery or (3) or watch and wait and see how the pain is six months from now. I decided on the watch and wait method, as I thought the other two options had some significant downsides.  Getting a diagnosis of arthritis has been somewhat depressing as I thought I wouldn't run into this type of health issue until my 60s, however, you never know what life has in store for you.  I will see how the symptoms progress. I am specifically worried about taking biologic medicines as one of the side effects is cancer - I certainly don't want that!",,3WMINLGALCPVDDO37VP2LYD4GZ3ACX,0.0

My knee was really hurting.  There was no ignoring it this time.  I had noticed the knee pain from time to time the last few months.  I initially chalked it up to the increase in my distance running since I was prepping for a half marathon.   I was starting to worry that I had a small tear in a tendon or possibly had done some serious damage to my kneecap the last time I fell while running in the rain.  I decided that I needed to call a doctor and have it checked out.  My regular doctor was able to get me in the next day, first thing in the morning.  He instructed me not to take painkillers or do anything that might effect the actual issue I was dealing with.  Normally, the pain went away relatively quickly, but not this time.  I was DYING to use some ICY HOT, or take some Advil.  As promised, the doc saw me at 9am bright and early - I had never been so happy to see him.  He ran some tests, took some blood, wrenched my knee this way and that until it brought tears to my eyes.  He also ran an extra AND took an Ultrasound.  All this uncertainty had me extremely worried.   He said he thought I had arthritis, but really wanted me to see an orthopedic doctor to confirm.  At 33, he felt I was really awful young and healthy to be worried about arthritis.   I was shuttled to the other side of the hospital offices to meet with the ortho doc.   He did, in fact, confirm that I had Osteoarthritis in my knee.   There really is no CURE or treatment, only a way to calm the symptoms.  I felt really defeated.  I loved to run - it was my source of stress relief and made me feel so good about myself.   The doctor suggested I cut back to my old running routine, and put the half marathon on hold - apparently by giving my knee a break and boosting bone strengthening vitamin intake - my knee might bounce back later.   But in my mind,...all I could imagine was being 45 and walking with a cane.  I mean, if it is already starting at my age - I didn't like to think about what the future would hold.",,3WMINLGALCPVDDO37VP2LYD4GZ3ACX,0.0

I couldn't afford to run my AC constantly at that time (and even if I could afford to I shouldn't have), so sometimes I would just do walking meditation in my house to take my mind off the heat. It certainly didn't help with the whole being hot situation, but at least it was distracting for bit. Anyway, one evening after having dinner I decided to go do some walking up and down the little hallway I have in my house. It's one of the only parts of my house where I can do walking meditation properly. I can't remember if I was listening to a Dhamma talk at the time, but more than likely I was. I had my hands resting in front of me, right hand around left wrist, with my hands just freely hanging/resting around where my dick is. My eyes were gazing down and a few feet in front of me, so I wouldn't get distracted by my surroundings. It was probably 15 minutes or so into the walking meditation that I noticed my mind starting to settle down. There were still thoughts and mental movement here and there, but it was substantially less than usual. Around this time or maybe a little bit after a great sense of calm and peacefulness came over me. My breathing had become more subtle and my thoughts weren't as numerous or enthralling. This sense of calm didn't end with my walking meditation though. I can't entirely remember how long it lasted, but I'd say it was still around at least 15 minutes or so after I had finished walking.  I've had some similar experiences since then, but it doesn't always happen to that extent.",3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC,,0.0

After checking out all the pics, I paid my respects to Steve. I checked out all the flowers till I saw the ones I had sent . Wanted to make sure they were worth what I paid. Damn , I will miss him a lot . Wish he didn't leave us all so soon.  His passing was quite a surprise to me . He had hid his medical problems from me and I was shocked to hear he died.  Most people there were quite somber.  A few were sniffling and there were tears in many eyes. His siblings in particular were teary eyed. I paid my condolences to each one of them. I did not know them much. Only occasionally, did I meet the sister in passing.  Nice people , all of them. Wish I got to meet them under different circumstances. Afterwards, I signed the signature book . Looked around and found some ""holy pictures"" with his info on the back . Knelt by Steve one last time.  Said my good byes. Hugged the siblings  and gave them my final condolences .",,3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJI7WB10,0.0

Our group of guys is a bout 15 people and range in age of 40 to 70 years old. We play a lot of golf together, we hang out at some of the same sports bars, and we play poker together.  We had a funeral for our beloved friend Steve two months ago. He was a veteran, and hard worker, and a good friend to all. It was amazing to see how many people who showed up at Steve's funeral to pay their respects. I was one of the speakers and shared some funny stories on some of the golf trips and other vacationing trips we went on. It was a sad but happy moment that all the friends were able to get together to honor our friends. It was good to have Steve's siblings there because they lived hours away and did not know the type of friends he had. They did not know all the fun experiences he had with friends in the last 10 years. Most importantly the did not know what a great support group he had. So after the great memorial, we all met at his local watering hole and enjoyed some food and libations. It was such a wonderful time to have a celebration of life as Steve had so many good friends. His extended family also showed up and partake in the celebration. We had collages and pictures of Steve's life and his activities. Some of them catching fish, play golf, or just having fun.

What I find memorable is when I went down to Sea World for a recent trip. The trip was well over due and was infact a weekend vacation. I drove down from my town in Central California but first I needed to buy a GPS. I found one on sale online for about 100 bucks, a Garmin type. I proceeded to wait for it and update and install it in my vehicle. My vehicle also needed some maintenance like an oil change and tire check up. I was ready to roll, it was at this moment I realized I could've probably used my cell phone with google maps to direct me but you can't be certain because it doesn't work without cellular data on continually. I went to the local dollar store and stocked up on snacks and drinks; the usual water, gummies, some twix, and some chips. I then loaded up my playlist which is a mix of various genres and hit the free way. The driving was so soothing and chill, the California weather was spectacular. I was well on my way; 3 hours later I stopped in a Subway for some lunch. I then continued on my journey. I stopped again later for some gas; bathroom; and restock on snacks. Later that evening I finally reached San Diego but it was very late; I needed a place to rest because the events would be happening the following day on Saturday. I went to my brothers house and crashed with him; he didn't know I was coming because I wanted to surprised him. I ended up meeting him and he decided to go with me to Sea World so he could show me around the place, its huge. I ended up having something take alot of pictures for me while I posed by the different animals. The place was very stunning; my favorite part was the Killer Whale exhibit where you go watch them do tricks with their trainers. I wouldn't feel comfortable being so close to something with the world ""killer"" in its name, seems dangerous but the trainers weren't harmed. I ended up grabbing lunch later with my brother at some Mexican taco shop in Sea World that had massive burritos that put Chipotle to shame. It seemed like time flew and it was already evening. That was my recent trip; I won't bore you with the details about returning.",,3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJUTHB15,0.0

I am divorcing my husband.  We will go our separate ways.  Time will heal all wounds.  At this moment in my life I am ready to start over.  It was a very difficult marriage.  We were never on the same page.  I focused mainly on the duties of the house and homeschooling my children.  He lived a life that was separate from ours.  He worked late most evening.  By the time he got home the children would be retiring for the night and I was to exhausted to care.  The sign was there that we were quickly growing apart.  I wanted to go to counseling but he didn't.  I wanted to have date nights but he did not want to make time for it.  It takes two to want a marriage.  He wore me out so, I evidently did not want it either.  I filed for divorce because the marriage was irreconcilable broken.  It was no way that it could be fixed.  Needless to say, he was shocked at least he said he was. He claimed that he did not know that it had gotten to that point.  He said that he was blindsided.  I find that so hard to believe.  Maybe, he was in denial.  I must admit that I was in denial for a long time about the relationship getting better.  It was time for me to test my wings.",3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQ6FV74Q,,0.0

I worked very hard to get to that point, and I still have a hard time believing I achieved my goal. My family (my dad and sister) went to my graduation, so it was nice knowing that I had some support in the audience. It was a hot day with a slight breeze. I found myself feeling like I was in a dream, almost wanting to pinch myself to make sure the moment was real. It was a long process; there were a ton of speeches and it was dragging on for a long time. Eventually it was time for my group to get their diploma and I was beyond ready to get it over with. Dont get me wrong, I loved the occasion, but it was taking to long to get to the point. When my name was called, I couldnt be anymore excited. As I walked to the person holding my diploma, I have a giant smile going from ear to ear. Once I had the diploma in my hand, I wanted to leave and get some food, but I had to go back and sit with the group. I can definitely say though, that it was an achievement worth all the hard work. I had my doubts at times, but it paid off. I achieved my goal and got what I wanted. I had times when I wanted to give up, but was glad I didnt.",3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TAPMZN38,,0.0

She said they needed people to do extra work at the weekend in some bar scenes downtown. She asked if I'd be available that weekend to be an extra and I said I would. I conformed that it would  be paid and she took my details. On Friday evening I got an email with directions and instructions for the nxt day. I was nervous and still a little sceptical but I went down on Saturday anyway. I was sitting in the holding area for about 90 minutes when I was asked to follow the assistant director. They took me to the hair and makeup trailer and after looking me over they asked if I would be interested in being a body double. This meant an increase in pay and I got to be part of the action in the longest scene of the day standing opposite the leading man. We did many, many takes and I was standing in for all the rehearsals and about 12 takes of the scene. I got direction from the director and the crew was very nice to me. We were taken to a 5 star hotel in the city for lunch and I got to sit and eat with the stars rather than the other extras. The day was long, I was there about 14 hours all in but I got to be a famous actresses body double for the day, I earned a lot of money, I met the stars and the director and they asked me to come back the next day, Sunday, where they put me in a bar scene and gave me a decent amount of screen time sitting behind the leads. This also took a long time and we were at the bar for about 10 hours with another lunch break. That day we got cash to go buy our own lunch. We got $50 each so that was nice and I got to pocket most of it.  It was something I never though I would do and it was a very cool day.",,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMULJQ0FH,0.0

After thinking this, I realized how high up I was. My chest went tight and I repeated curses in my head. The pressure from the ascend made my panic worse. I managed to calm down by loosing my bra and distracting myself with a movie. The panic returned so I stared straight ahead and tried to ignore the pressure that the descending plane gave. As we descended, I couldn't help but glance out the window again. The world again looked picturesque.

It was very hard to say goodbye but at least we had time to spend together the last few years as the cancer was not sudden and was caught early enough to treat and extend her life. My mom fought a hard fight and did not let cancer take her easily. In fact she was fighting to the very end and never let cancer define her life. I was able to be with her throughout this journey and am grateful that she was able to spend her last few years with me and my family. My daughter will always remember her grandma as a fighter and someone who never gave up.  Every time the doctors told us the end was near my mom fought through and bought herself another few months. It got to the point though that the pain was obviously wearing her down both mentally and physically and myself and my wife had to let her know it was ok to let go. That was probably the hardest part of the whole thing, telling my own mother that it was ok to stop fighting so she could be at peace. We knew that if she thought we were not ready to let go that she would keep fighting until she had nothing left. She came home from the hospital for her last few weeks and we will always cherish that time we spent as a family together. Now that she is gone I am still sad and miss her greatly but am glad that she is at peace and free of pain. She taught my daughter what it means to fight and to not give up regardless of the odds. She also taught us how to let go and say goodbye. Her funeral was not a sad affair as we gathered all of her family and friends and had a party to remember who she was as a person and what she truly meant to us all.",3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK,0.0

Only about an hour from where i lived. It was a maze just getting from the parking lot to the ticket booth. There was tram for every part of the park which was nice. The prices were crazy but i was just glad i was not the one paying for it. I went in with low expectations but all of that changed shortly afterwards. I got in on several rides to start and was blown away. It was like being in an entire different world. The only thing i did not like were the large crowds. I had lunch afterwards. The food was great but the prices were not. Got on some more rides afterwards until i could not no more. I took some picture while i was there so i could later recall the memorable day i had.

To celebrate and mark the occasion my grown son took me to Walt Disney World for a week long vacation. I had never been to Disney World and, being a lifetime fan of Disneyland, having the chance to experience this park with my son was a dream come true. I had become very ill nine years ago and nearly lost my life to liver and heart failure. The illness came out of the blue and remains an unknown etiology as far as my physician is concerned. My recovery and transformation has been time consuming and come with many changes to my life, abilities, and career. My son walked along my side during my illness and knew that reaching a point where I could travel with him would be the best reward I could hope for. Our vacation was amazing from the moment we reached Florida and boarded the Disney bus. Our resort hotel was absolutely beautiful and the parks were amazing. Animal Kingdom was by far our favorite resort with Epcot a close second. My son had been very careful to book all of our dining reservations with my needs in mind. A chef came to our table to ask me about my dietary restrictions and made beautiful meals for me. We even had a refrigerator and microwave in our room so I could prepare my own breakfast each day. We both agreed that Disneyland still outshines any theme park and will be our family favorite. I rarely spend long periods of time with my son since he is 32, very busy in his career, and travels the world for business. Having this week with him, building memories, and sharing new experiences is a time I will always treasure.",3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAPNABCI,3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAPNABCI,0.0

I have not seen her in quite a while but it happened about a month ago. I saw our old coworker Doug at the grocery store and we stopped to say hello and he asked me if I knew. I asked, knew what? But I felt like I already knew. I had been worried about Karen for a long time. He said that they had needed to do an autopsy and that they had been waiting out the results for quite some time. He said the family had said that, but they were pretty sure it was drugs. An accidental overdose. I really do wish she had reached out. I was surprised when she was fired, and when I heard that she kept having trouble with her son's father. I hope her son is okay but I feel like I know he won't be. How will his father explain that? How will grow up with this knowledge inside him, that something ate away at his mother so terribly that she decided to leave his life. I don't know. I wish she had found help for whatever was eating away at her. I guess people don't always know to reach out for help, I guess I wish  I had found a way to reach her that she had heard.

She has become an integral part of our family and is becoming a little bit more of a little human every day.  She started crawling at seven months and got her front teeth at eight months.  She's been teething a grumpy recently, but is still as cute as a button no matter how hard she cries.  We typically go out to eat with my parents and sister on Saturdays.  We bring her daughter, Dalyla, and Lily's big sister, Evelyn.  They're typically little terrors as they're age three and four; still adorable though.  I can't imagine life without these little brats.  On this particular Saturday, we chose to go to the park after we ate at a local Italian restaurant.  There is a splash pad at this park and it's a hot day so the cold water is very welcome.  Lilian is wearing her cute little pink, flowery bikini and is standing next to grandpa.  She looks me directly in the face and takes three deliberate steps toward me.  I scream in delight and scare the begeezus out of her uncle, who also came with us to the park today.  My father and I are laughing and declaring our pride.  She took her first steps!  We witnessed her first steps!  No one could be prouder at that moment.  No matter how many children I choose to have, there will never be a prouder moment than when one of them completes a milestone for the first time.

We kept in touch from time to time until suddenly, he just stopped responding. I tried calling, emailing, messaging mutual friends, even wrote a letter to his last known address - but there was no response. I was really concerned that something had happened. I could see my messages on facebook and Whatsapp were being read, just there was no contact back. But a few months ago, he finally started writing back. I guess he did not want to share everything that was happening with him, because he was afraid to admit that things were not going well. He wanted to keep it all to himself. But keeping it all to himself ended up scaring a lot of us who didn't know what was happening. But now that he's writing back, a good friend of mine has returned. I get to hear how things are going in his life. I get to see how he is tackling his challenges and where the next stage in life is taking him. Far from a scary absence, this is now returning to the fun and joyful friendship we always had. I'm really glad that he decided he could start writing back.

We also discussed my qualifications for the job and the new role. We discussed what the responsibilities of the new role would be. We had sat and talked for quite a while. It was a productive interview overall. I learned a lot about the role, what I could bring to it and how I could help the team succeed. It took a while but i was offered the new role. The person interviewing me had considerable power over me and i'm sure it took some thought as to who they would hire for the job. I was honored to accept the new role.

I have been a Blair Witch fan for 20 years, so this was a big deal to me. I decided that I would write an article about the series which would chronicle the mythology of the story and pitch the article to the major horror sites. To my surprise and delight, one of the first sites I pitched to, Wicked Horror, picked it up. It ran in four parts over the course of about a month. I was so excited! I had just gotten paid to write a four part article on a subject I loved and was passionate about! In addition, it was very well received. Garnering many views and many likes on the pages. I felt elated and proud and the rush that comes with creating something and having it be appreciated. The actual writing of the article had been exhausting (even more so because I was (and am) in the middle of a rather intensive diet which had a tendency to make me light headed at times) and required an immense amount of reading on my part. This was all made worthwhile by selling the piece and getting the positive reaction, however. In the end the experience left me mentally drained for a long time afterwards (writing around 100 pages while also working 48 hour weeks and dieting was pretty intense). Still, I wouldn't have traded it for anything, because now, in my own small way I know I have contributed to a story that I love and respect. And that makes me feel very proud and all of the sacrifice and effort seem worth it.",,3X0H8UUIT2A8R7G25MBUISEDUMHWSF,0.0

I can feel my stress rising. I need to get away from my desk and cannot. I have yet to start on another project that recently got assigned to me. What could this distraction be? I look up and ask what's going on? The answer ""everyone gets to go home early."" Apparently the boss realized that the stress levels were getting high and that a break was needed.

On my birthday my mother came over to my house to bring me a card and a little gift.  When she arrived, we hugged and she told the story of my birth (like she does every year) and said that I was born so fast that by the time my father got home, the hospital had called to say I'd been delivered. Back in my parents day, many husbands would drop their laboring wives off at the hospital only to return after the baby was born.  But let me get to the point of my story. Growing up, my mother used to tell me stories about how her parents fell in love and got married. It was the 1930's and they were young and poor so my grandmother never had a wedding ring. Later on, after 3 children were born, my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a little town in south Georgia. My grandfather took my grandmother to his store and had her pick out any ring she wanted.  It was a very touching story and I always thought it was so sweet. She picked out a modest diamond ring and a matching diamond fishtail band. She only wore it when she dressed up for some special occasion. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now and my father died a few years ago.  My mother was going through some of my fathers things and went into the safe.  She came across the ring and decided that I should have it.  So I got a birthday card and a little gift that touched me deeply.  I was so surprised that she gave me the rings because I never knew she had them.   I now wear the band as part of my wedding set.  It makes me feel special and like a part of them is still with me.",3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXW87H8L5,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXW87H8L5,0.0

I was on a vacation with a friend, sightseeing, and doing all things tourists do. I ended up not paying too much attention to the people around me when I suddenly heard someone yell at me that I was getting robbed. I looked to see where the voice came from and it was from a boy no older than my 8 year old nephew back home. He alerted me early enough to see what was happening. A thief was trying to slash my bag to take my wallet. My eyes connected with the thief's and I first saw panic in his, then came anger and headed straight towards the little boy. Thankfully, someone was close enough to the little boy to protect him from the thief. The thief got tackled to the ground by two men from the gathering audience. The boy was then taken into a shop nearby to make sure that he was safe. I went to the shop where the boy was to express my gratitude and tell him how I thought he's very brave for what he's done. The boy smiled at me and said that he was only doing the right thing. I then bought him $25 worth of candy in the store to reward him and I could swear that he's the happiest boy on earth that day. I stepped out of the store to see two policemen taking the thief into custody. They were actually looking for me to take my testimony and asking if I wanted to press charges against him. I went with the policemen to the precinct for the paper works and the thief was in jail 10 minutes later.",,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBSZL89,0.0

I applied to the graduate school that I wanted to attend for my PhD, but they only offered MA admission. I really can't afford to do that as I already have 2 MA's. The financial strain alone would be a big problem for me and I wasn't sure what to do. I could re-apply at another school, but with no certainties, I was unsure what to do. I decided that I would try one more time at my second choice school. If I didn't get offered admission I would then try and figure out what to do next. So I got my material together and sent off a new application. It took awhile, but I finally heard back from the college. They couldn't let me start a PhD admission at this time, but would be happy to have me start when they next offered admission. On one hand I was happy they somewhat accepted, but on the other I was unsure if I should take them up on that offer. I would probably have to get some kind of job while I waited and wondered about that. It was hard to make a choice when you have so many thoughts going through your head. So I relaxed and spent some time cooling off before I made any real choice. In the end I decided to attend at the later date when I could start, so I started to prepare to wait.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HX0RWR5,0.0

We were worried about her not being able to conceive a healthy childIt was first child for both of us. Both of our parents were at the hospital to witness this amazing day for our family. I have heard other people mention how becoming a parent changes your life and i always used to brush off as people are being too dramatic. But after becoming a father i actually realized how i was wrong to dismiss people feeling.  It is the greatest feeling i have experienced in my life. It has given a new purpose to my life. Everyday i look forward to go home after work and spend time with my son. I am a very sensitive sleeper. But now since we had our baby, I don't even mind waking up at night to feed the baby or even to change the diapers. I would cherish this day for the rest of my life.

It was two months ago when he was laid off from his job. There was no warning and he honestly thought he'd be working there for years. I helped him get a temp job at a place near where he lives and that helped him out some. We've been hanging out a lot more and I've been there for him to talk to, and he says I've been a lot of help. It was around that time when Jon met me after work one evening. I had been a little late as I forgot something in my cubicle and went back to get it. When I came outside I saw Jon talking to Sara, a coworker of mine. Sara is not exactly someone I would consider girlfriend material. She has a reputation around the office, and one of my other coworkers used to date her and told me she cheated on him several times while they were dating. I walked over to them and said ""Hi"". That was when Sara said she better get going and left. Jon explained his interest in her, and told me Sara had given her number to him before I had gotten there. I told him about her reputation and my coworker who used to date her, but Jon didn't want to believe it. He thought she seemed nothing like that and said he was going to call her that evening. I was surprised to hear that the next day Jon had started dating Sara. I think he made the wrong decision. Since they've been dating he hasn't talked to me as much, and I think he's going to end up getting hurt in the end.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HZSNRWI,0.0

My partner and I called over the radio to inform dispatch that we had found an unlocked door and that we were going to check the building to ensure that no one was inside that was not supposed to be. This was very exciting as it was my first major event that I did as a police officer. It may not sound like much to the average person, but for a police officer searching a building with the unknown potential of a person being inside is quite dangerous because you do not know if they are armed and/or under the influence of a substance. After securing the building there were no individuals found inside. We contacted dispatch again to let them know the result of the search and to contact a ""key holder"" to let them know about the unlocked door. We returned to our patrol car and waited for dispatch to contact the key holder for the church. This church was one of three churches within our community and we did proactive policing by check all the doors at each church. That is how we came across this unlocked door at the church. This is only one of many stories that I have as being a police officer. This job requires patience, paying attention to little details, learning and reacting from mistakes without hesitation, and to be respectful and brave. We look out for our community and the safety of each and every individual within. I love my job as a police officer and I cannot wait to see where it takes me in the future. I highly recommend this occupation to those who love to be active and enjoy doing something that can go from nothing to something dangerous in a moments notice.

People are fine -- they just don't like me. Back in the days of high school, socializing was much easier. I went to school because I had to, and they were there because they had to be. It wasn't a big deal...I talked to them, because I didn't have a choice. Sure I was bullied, and I had a hell of a time...but that little bit of socialization helped me in may ways. Once I graduated, I didn't feel the need to really go out. And that snowballed in the last decade to me possibly being a hermit. I wouldn't call myself that, but my sister did a couple weeks ago when she called to catch up.  I'm not going to lie, it hurt because I knew it was true. I had only moved here a few months ago, I told her...but she laughed. She knew that was an excuse. This was ongoing behavior for me, and we both knew it. So I took the plunge the next day, joined a local writer's club and opened up. A few of us exchanged social media info, and started chatting on the phone and thru text. We all kinda clicked. Big Sis wasn't all that impressed...apparently people are supposed to do these sort of things. Anywho, just writing to brag a little about finally coming out of my shell after so long of being a hermit. Sorry I haven't written lately...I've been busy with the new friends!

She has been with Sean for about five years, though they definitely had their hard times. Things started out so well before they began to have a lot of disagreements around Sean's alcohol consumption. Around two years in it became absolutely unbearable for Sharon and she had to do something about it. After a large argument and much intervention, she ultimately told Sean that she needs to leave him if he did not quit drinking. She did not want to leave him but she was under the belief that this was the only thing that could get Sean to go back to his former self that she fell in love with. Initially, Sean took this terribly and told her if she really did not love him that she should just go then. She, reluctantly, left. Two days later Sean called her from a rehab center, saying that upon further reflection he knew Sharon was right and he decided to check himself in to rehab. Sharon agreed to support him through this and they stayed together while Sean learned to handle his problems. After about six months Sean got out of rehab and their relationship began to blossom again. It was exactly like it was when things started out and Sean and Sharon were the perfect couple together again. About a year ago now, Sean proposed to Sharon and seeing that he was a changed, true, and whole man again, Sharon agreed excitedly. After a lot of planning, they settled on the perfect wedding for them - a small wedding in a small venue with only close friends and family. It was truly the proudest moment of my life. It was wonderful to watch my sweet daughter get married to the man of her dreams and it was also clear to me that Sean's intentions were true and honest. A story that started out blissfully, turned into much pain, finally had a happy ending and I could not have been happier about all of it. It was a true joy and an absolutely wonderful event. They are still so happy together and I could not be happier Sean never looked back to the bottle.",,3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKSY5HNV,0.0

Not only was my husband having to use an electric wheelchair, but Orlando was under a heat advisory. It was the hottest day of the year and Disney's busiest day of the year! What really impressed me was how much fun we had an how little waiting we had to do despite the adverse conditions. We got to Disney World as soon as it opened, determined to make the best of our time there. We at breakfast in our AirBnb and headed out. Because of my husband's injury, we got to park in handicapped parking. This was definitely a silver lining of his having to use a wheelchair! We were in covered parking and didn't have to walk far at all. We got into the park and started with our pre-scheduled fast passes. Everything went so smoothly and the waits were so short. The highlight of our trip was my daughter getting to meet all the princesses. I was worried about this, and figured we wouldn't be meeting any characters. Everything I had heard was that you had to wait in line for hours and it didn't seem worth it to me. But you can use a fast pass for character meetings! So we did that, and it was amazing. My daughter loves meeting characters. We got to take great pictures of our own and she had a blast. Another big surprise for me was how amazing the food was. We had nachos for lunch and hamburgers for dinner, and they were so delicious! I've eaten a lot of theme park food at various Six Flags and even at Universal the day before. Wow! Disney really delivered on the menu items. It was Independence Day, so our day ended with fireworks. It wasn't always easy navigating with the wheelchair and putting up with the heat, but it was definitely worth it.",3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WRV1TQSJ,,0.0

About five months ago she ran into the room and showed me her pregnancy test with excitement. This was a very emotional moment because we had been trying for five months. The whole process has been life-changing. I feel like I've grown so much as a person because of this. Her sister isn't able to have babies so we weren't sure if it was hereditary at first. So Immediately when we found out, we were both really happy. We had bounced names off of each other all week for a boy or a girl. I think at the time we decided either Luca or Atlas if it was a boy. If it was a girl we were both set on rory, since we used to binge gilmore girls. A few months later and we finally were at the doctor. This was going to be the big gender reveal. Our child was being stubborn in his mom and wouldn't turn over but eventually we discovered what we were going to have. We're having a boy.

She and her fiancee (now husband) were married on a small hobby farm about 45 minutes away. They wanted to get married in a field, which is what they got: a small meadow in a grove of old-growth oaks.  The weather was unseasonably cool, and basically perfect: blue sky with fluffy white clouds, only about 80 degrees, and not a drop of rain.  I finally know what they mean when they say a bride looks radiant: I've never seen Jane looking so happy! The ceremony was conducted by Uncle Tad. He made some moving remarks. Afterwards, we took tractors and trams across the highway to a little ""lodge"" and retreat center.  I saw so many of our friends and family and it was great to reminisce and play ""catch up"" with them. I gave a toast that I worked on for weeks, and Jane cried a little. Dinner was excellent and we danced the night away! I also made a lot of new friends, including a college friend of my sister's. She and I really hit it off! I got her phone number and we have been texting almost every day! All in all the day was beautiful and wonderful--just like Jane.

It was just the old members and associates like me who would were cool to hang out sometimes but not to go riding with or to wear the jackets.  I still never expected it to happen the way it did. They made me feel like a real brother. The leader Joe had never seemed to fully warm up to me but he did seem like he was a bit gruff with everyone so I hadn't taken it to heart. But imagine my surprise when he clapped me on the back and said ""welcome, brother."" That was incredible to have earned his trust. I hope I am worthy of it. That night was amazing though. I tried not to get emotional or anything because that wouldn't have been cool around those guys.

I was looking through Twitter, seeing what people were saying when I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I had briefly looked up, and saw something that at the time, didn't mean much to me. A woman had walked into my room, a dead look in her eyes as she started at me, before turning around and walking out. I had assumed it was somebody looking for the bathroom, but they didn't ask for instructions, instead me assuming they were just shocked at walking into a bedroom. I brushed it off, and continued with what I was doing, until I heard a shriek come from the living room. ""Who are you!?"" I heard my mother shout. I got up and ran to the front room, to see what was going on. I arrived just in time to see some of the guests escorting the mystery woman out of the house.

I had to carry him back over. I petted the dog after this ordeal. I gave him some water. I gave him some dog food. He was happy because of this. I hope that he will have a long and happy life as long as we both live.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZ6GDZ7K,0.0

My brother brought his kid over to to introduce me, he's only a couple of months old. I was kind of apathetic to the whole thing but I figured I would humor my brother and be a good uncle. When he brought that little guy over, the first thing I noticed was the smell. Diapers had always been a big turn off for me and kids always just seemed like useless bags of flesh to me, not something I could really have much affection for. But when I held him in my arms, he smiled at me with such a warm smile it melted my heart. All those preconceptions I had about him before were gone and I suddenly realized why people love babies. They're so warm and untainted by all the things that ruin people as they get older. In a way they're like animals, just consciousness in its purest form and I find it really remarkable and sweet. I believe in the future I'll try to have kids if I meet the right woman. In the mean time I'll enjoy playing with his son and getting to know him though. I hope that I like the toddler stage as much as the baby stage. I hear that they can be a real handful at that age.  But for now, he's a little bundle of joy and I look forward to seeing him again. I'm especially looking forward to taking him to his first sporting event and seeing how he reacts.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFFAZ7O,0.0

I walked into the stable to meet my new horse.  I was so excited to finally own a horse of my own.  I have wanted a horse my whole life.  I looked for quite some time before deciding to meet this horse that I felt was just perfect.  Only one thing, he was a giant! I have never seen a horse so tall in my life.  I didn't know how I would ever be able to ride him.  I knew I should have got a horse that was a bit more easy to ride, but I knew he was the one I wanted.  I took him home to let him settle in to the new stable.  After a day or so, I put the bridle on him.  I used a step stool to put the saddle on his back.  Now the challenge came as to how I would get on the horse to ride him.  I led him over to the wooden fence.  I climbed on the fence and hopped on.  I knew this was the start to a great relationship.",,3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFGM7ZA,0.0

I had in mind exactly what I wanted and I knew it would be  very challenging to find one that met those expectations. I saw an add for this one and immediately contacted the owner about him. However, he did not fit perfectly what I had in mind. I decided to sit on it a week and think about it. I could not get him out of my mind and kept looking at his pictures over and over. I decided to make the 3 hour drive to check him out and as soon as I saw him I knew he was the one. I rode him and he was ok, but once again didn't fit exactly what I wanted. I knew in my heart though that he was perfect so I decided to give him a try and purchase him on the agreement that if he didn't work out right he could go back to the original owner. He worked out perfect and there was no looking back. He is my dream and we work wonderful together. My daughter changed his name to Butter from Tucker and it fits him perfectly.  He gets along with my other horses wonderfully, in fact one of them escaped to get in the pasture with him when I first brought him home. They are all best friends now and share their food wonderfully. He is very sweet and loving. He always wants to give hugs and nuzzles.

He has only had one other owner his whole life so I know his background and training. He has no hidden ghosts in his closet, unlike Bourbon. His name was Tucker but he is being renamed to Butter because he really does look like a stick of butter. My daughter loves him and thinks that he is just the best thing ever.

I never thought I'd experience the closest thing to spirituality when I agreed to go to the zoo. While I've always enjoyed going I never had such a wonderful opportunity like this.  My mom, brother and I were all there, and I think we all shared this wonder. We all had our hand full of leaves purchased at the kiosk. I assumed I'd drop mine in fear. Giraffes are much bigger up close. Much, much bigger than horses. I was nervous on approach but the one giraffe that came to me looked into my eyes before she bent her head, and by that time I was so mesmerized I let her take the leaves. She knew I had more in the other hand so she waited patiently while I gave her the rest, and my reward was to be allowed to brush through her hair with my fingers. I even touched a velvety horn.  What surprised me was it's tongue. The giraffe's tongue touched my hand once, but I didn't mind. It wasn't too wet. It was a bit like a dog's but also very long and snakelike. And then I did it over and over. I kept running back to the kiosk for more leaves. My mom and brother were ready to move on, but I didn't want to go. I feel like this day changed me and made me want to study animals more. I work with dogs all day, 40-60 medium to large sized dogs, but I'm really thinking I'd like to study bigger animals.",3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2,,0.0

I stopped what i was doing and made the twenty minute drive there only to find out he passed away about four minutes before i got there. It's hard to believe he passed away. My poor mom is beside herself. We are absolutely stunned by this. They say now that it was a drunk driver. He drove right through a red light ramming my stepfathers car. When he T-Boned  my step fathers car he crushed the entire drivers side door in. They had to use the jaws of life to pry the doors open to help him. The detectives say they have a lead on who hit him. They went back to the scene and got footage of the crash. The footage gave them a clear enough view to see the liscense plate.

My sister lives in another country and we had not seen her for 3 years. A week before the party she called to tell me that she was comming home as a surprise. We coordinated everything to meet her at the airport without others knowing, it was very exciting. Keeping the secret was difficult, But it was worth it. It was necessary to say some excuses that justify my absence from home for a few hours, answering hidden calls and asking other people to attend to my things while I was in charge of looking for my sister. My mother always said how much she wanted to see my sister and my sister told my mom that because of her work it was impossible to travel home. However she made the effort and bought the ticket. Not commenting on my mother was complicated because I wanted her to know that she would see her daughter and have that illusion. But the plan to arrive by surprise worked greatWhen the precise moment arrived and all the guests were already at home, my sister came through the door and everyone shouted in excitement, especially my parents. My mother could not believe it. She cried and jumped of joy. My dad was also very excited, so much that he even got a little dizzy. We all cry with joy and agree that we would not give any more surprises to my parents, since they are old people and those strong emotions can hurt them. I cried a lot of joy while recording everything on video.",,3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYRHI5H4,0.0

I was finally able to marry the girl of my dreams, something that for a long time I didn't know was possible. We haven't officially gotten married yet, but being engaged allowed to take things to the next level. We bought a house that was simply beautiful and was pretty similar to what I wanted to have growing up. It was hard to believe that things were falling into place for me. While the house was great and the person I got to spend my life with was greater, something was still missing. We weren't really about kids, but we wanted to care for something. I had wanted a dog for a long time, and she was a dog lover herself. The breed was debated here and there, but we ultimately settled on a Maltese puppy. I believe we made the right decision. The pup has taken well to the household and we think that was what was needed to complete the home. I honestly just look forward to my future unfold before me. Again, hard to believe someone like me could be blessed with something so wonderful. And this was just five months ago. And we're only getting started.",,3XXU1SWE8NHBJLTNVFWIQXB3NRKA0W,0.0

I try not to think about the negative things, especially that night. I find that when I do I start becoming angry again and again. There is nothing I can do about what happened except make sure it does not happen again. The money it has cost and is currently costing is taking away from my family. This is what happened when I was arrested for a DUI and some of the many feelings I've had. I was drinking and decided to drive, no other details really matter. I made that choice. Even though I was upset at the time and that should have been more of a light bulb going off telling me not to drive. When I hit that car I thought the worse. I am so thankful the other people were not hurt.  My husband did come get me out of jail the next day and I know he was mad. He may not be the best husband but he is there when it really counts. Since that arrest and my last diary post, I've been fined $1400 and 3 years probation. Once I pay my fine the probation will be unsupervised. I have reported to my probation officer and I feel so out of place. The two times I went I did not fit the picture of someone reporting for probation, at least in my own head. I have not even told my best friend, she lives in another state. I know she would not care but I've noticed since that happened I have distanced myself from people that I'm close with. I only have casual acquaintances now it seems. That kind of makes me sad to say but it is true. Maybe that is another way I am punishing myself.

Due to this I have faced many problems at the expense of my family. I am seen by a doctor and do have a job (not sure how I have a job because I miss a lot of work). My kids love me and turn a blind eye because I am a functional alcoholic. I'm starting to feel a bit sad. So here it is, I was pulled over 5 months ago, DUI. Crazy! White, a mom, pretty, has a good job, veteran, all these things. This is something that is my fault completely. I've recently went to court and am so thankful for how things were decided. I did have a lawyer I hired ($3000). I do have a lot of fines and probation. I realize I need help and have been seeing a counselor at the VA since (and before).

Since my first writing, not much has changed between my mother and myself. We are definitely not as close as we were before any of this, and there has been no real attempt by either of us to repair our relationship. Again, to reiterate points I made in my first writing, my uncle is very important to me. He played a major role in my upbringing, was a massive influence in my life, and a very positive influence to that matter. Thankfully, I have been able to visit him a few times since the last writing, and have been in contact with him via text messaging quite a bit.  Unfortunately, in the last few weeks he has taken a turn for the worse, and is now back in the hospital again after being released for a short period of time. Two days ago we found out that his platelet count has dropped very low after receiving chemo treatment, which he never really wanted to have done in the first place. He says he has made his peace, and whatever happens is whats going to happen, and doesn't think it is worth it to keep racking up such high medical bills when there is no chance the chemo will be able to save his life. I am having a hard time with this, and am finding it very difficult to accept. I know that this how things go when someone is diagnosed with something such as this. But the man is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure where I am at emotionally at the moment. Thankfully I have a good support system in place with my wife, and friends, and they are really helping to keep the negative emotions at bay.  At this point, the doctors have no real expectations of how long he'll survive, as every time something positive happens, it seems like something equally as negative happens. But just like I said in my last entry, I am going to keep doing my best to stay positive, and keep hoping for the best. Maybe in the coming weeks my mother, and will begin to repair our relationship, and maybe not. But, things are what they are now, and there are far more important things on my mind than the way she chose to handle this situation.",3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDF2DVQ,,0.0

So I cried, again from joy and hugged him. I asked him how he got those tickets because when I looked online it was outrageous-the price that is.

He was not a believer but told me that when he died he would come visit me to confirm it's realness if it was so. Fast forward to adulthood again, and about 1 month before he died we were talking on the phone and he stated that we have to see each other soon. He was afraid that he did not have much time left here. He needed to see his baby girl quickly. He soon passed but came to me my dreams dressed in white. He was smiling broadly, and around 30 years old. He had no eyes because what replaced them was wisp of spirit I could see clearly in them I knew he was fulfilling his promise to me when I was a little girl.

However last year I did not receive their invitation. I suspect it is because my mother found out that I had decided to quit college to pursue my passion. Since I was lonely, I decided to hang out with friends instead. Mary hosted me in her apartment. She prepared a nice meal and opened a bottle of wine. After a few glasses, I opened up to her about my anxiety. I told her about how I was finding it hard to conform and meet my parents expectations of me.  I found myself breaking down as I explained my problem. She is a very good listener. She was able to offer me advice and comfort. In the evening, she ordered a ride home for me. She even called to check on me when arrived.  In the end, I was glad to have a voided my judgmental parents. The time spent with Mary was meaningful to me.  I forged a strong relationship with Mary.",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJW6IP9,0.0

One of my friends offered to take me to a fireworks show in another county with some of her friends. We hung out for a bit beforehand, and then we went on the freeway to get to her friends' apartment. We talked about a bunch of fun stuff on the way. Then we met up with her friends, and I got to meet their cats. We went to the fireworks show, and the music selection was as bad as if someone had just searched for the acronym ""USA"" in a bunch of songs and set fireworks to the results. The fireworks were cool, though. On the way back to the train station, I felt like I needed to talk about the anxiety that I had been having lately. After listening to my experiences, she asked if I was okay, and talked about what she does to handle her anxiety. I was worried about having a panic attack on the train that night, so she drove me home instead, even though that was kind of expensive for her. She sent me a guide to some of her methods for helping with anxiety through text later. I felt so comforted by knowing that she dealt with that, too. I felt like someone was looking out for me, and I felt like the place I lived in felt like home. As opposed to my parent's home, which didn't feel like home with the 4th of July thing. I feel like we became much closer friends after that.",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJW6IP9,0.0

This was, of course, always our plan for him and we worked together as a team to make sure he got the grades to get into a good school. I also saved money as best I could to pay for college and we worked together to get him scholarships and grants. I was so proud of him when he got into a college he really wanted to go to, and we spent the summer getting everything ready for him to start this next chapter of his life. A few days before he left I started feeling sad, knowing I would miss him. It's just the two of us, so my house would feel empty. But I was also excited to start my next life chapter. We made the drive to school a fun road trip of a few days to spend some last time together. But wow. Now that he's been gone I can't believe how much I miss him. I'm really crushed to have him gone. I feel kind of guilty about this and hide it from him when he calls or texts to check in. He does miss me, too, of course, which is natural for all kids going off to college. I tell him I miss him, and I actually make up things to tell him that I'm doing (but I'm really not doing them). I stay home and just be sad that he's gone. This is crazy! My whole goal raising him was for him to become a competent adult who would leave me and go off and pursue his dreams, so why am I so darn sad?? Maybe I should go talk to someone? I have things I can do, I just need to get out of the house and do something productive. I'm really looking forward to the holidays when he's back home again. But I think I need to work through these overwhelming feelings and actually start living my new life so we have something to talk about when he's home. He'll have stories for me about college and all of his new experiences and I should be able to hold up my end of the conversation.

I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary. So much work to do, but I wanted to share this with you! Millie",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJWEPIO,0.0

His wife agrees somewhat that our daughter is capable of doing the job, but would prefer to not have to deal with his complaining. She told me that he is convinced that our daughter will do something completely unacceptable. He thinks she will decide to talk about sex, or have an emotional breakdown. He's also concerned he will personally have to become involved. He's also convinced he will be asked to intervene by their managers.

One morning I received a note from my manager advising me that she was flying into town to meet with me.  I of course was nervous and feared for the worst.  Unfortunately I was correct.  When my manager arrived she already had a conference reserved for us to meet in private.  She told me that there was a new CEO in the company and he was evaluating all of the current programs.  He determined that the program that I managed was going to be eliminated, and along with it my job as well.  I was given three months to find another position within the company, or else I would be offered a severance package.  I opted to leave and take the company buy out.  It was a traumatizing and demeaning experience for me to go through, especially after having nearly 20 highly rated years with the company.  I will probably never fully understand how the company could callously eliminate my position, without even speaking to me to obtain the necessary metrics to justify the program's existence.  Some time has passed, but I still feel bitter and resentful to this day.  I now hesitate to do business with the company.  I certainly no longer recommend it's products.  One day I might be able to get over it, but until that day comes I remain bitter.",3Y9N9SS8LZX5YKVWYC53IWHGMV3D3N,,0.0

We recently had children and we have been so busy raising them that we have not been able to spend much time together. After having a long talk about what kind of vacation we deserve we came up with the location of Las Vegas. We thought Las Vegas would be perfect because its close to home and it's a place were we can enjoy ourselves. While being in Vegas we visited many places and enjoyed great company with each other. We stayed about 4 nights in a classy hotel and got room service for the last day of our trip. That day my husband left to go get somethings and told me to get ready on the last day. When he came back we had a very classy dinner and had great conversations. My husband and I have been together about 11 Years now. My husband then kneeled down and proposed to me again! It was the most adorable thing ever, I felt so in love again. We are going to be renewing our vows with our whole family there. The most beautiful part is that i am able to have our children see us get remarried and be a part of our love.  Within the next year we will be having a ceremony and we are so excited. We are so happy that we took the time to tend to ourselves. We both deserved this vacation and it brought us closer in our relationship. Thats what I believe a vacation is to be able to release the negative energy that is built up and come back new loving beings.",,3Y9N9SS8LZX5YKVWYC53IWHGVPND34,0.0

This is something we haven't done since the second child was born. It took some planning as we currently do not reside near any family member. My mom agreed to fly over and watch the boys while we took the trip. We had to make sure that our trip coincided with mom's calendar as to when she could get a vacation from work. We decided on Las Vegas as we heard of all the live shows and it seemed like something we would be interested in. The day of the trip came and my mom was here and all settled in with the boys. While I was very nervous leaving them for an extended period, I had all confidence in my mom who already raised 7 kids herself. Getting to Las Vegas and seeing all the street performers, the many sights and the crowds was exciting and overwhelming at the same time. The live show we saw was magical.  The acrobatic movements of the cast daring and scary but  was a sight to behold. Dressing up in anything but leggings and t shirt was also a welcome change. It was simply amazing. The most memorable part of this event was being able to reconnect in a special way with my husband. Having the chance to focus only on each other helped us to remember why we fell in love . I would definitely like to make this an annual event where we get away just the two of us.",,3Y9N9SS8LZX5YKVWYC53IWHGVPND34,0.0

I joined because I wanted to get into better shape. It was also very close to where I live. He was there the third time I went. I don't think I'd seen him since I moved out 10 years ago, and hadn't thought about where him or anyone else moved to. I just kind of forgot. We talked and actually seemed to get along well. He looked pretty happy and wanted to know if I was new to the gym. I told him that I was. After that, we talked for a while. I'm surprised that he was so nice since my memories of them aren't the best. Mom never had anything good to say about them after I left. The family didn't get along well. As far as I know most of them moved out of the area. Definitely strange to bump into someone I didn't expect to see, but I'm happy I did and happy that he seems to be doing well. It definitely doesn't feel good when you meet people from your past and things go poorly.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8D8FF14K,0.0

I chose the Detroit art museum because it is the closest to me. I looked at all of the paintings with care and made sure I paid attention to all the details of each painting. There were many nice paintings but there was on in particular that caught my eye. It was a painting of birds and watermelons. The brush strokes were detailed and smooth. The colors were muted but still seemed to pop out at you. The lines and definition were precise but also looked blended so that each object moved seamlessly into the other. i wanted to know who painted this. the plaque under the painting told me the name of the painting and the painter. I decided that I would look up more work by this artist. I wanted to learn from their style . I thought it would be great to paint like that. I decided to go to the gift shop in the museum and I just happened to find a book about the artists work. It was expensive but I thought it was worth the money. I bought it and rushed home that I could study the artists other paintings. It was a very productive and educational trip.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DBY914J,0.0

After landing and going through customs our rental car was ready.  We drove to the resort where they greeted us with fruit punch for the kids and rum punch for my husband and I.  The lobby was fantastic with open air views of the pool and ocean, marble floors and coastal decor with a touch of elegance.   Once we settled into our room we returned to the lobby to check out the activity desk.  Since we had never been on a boating trip we decided to take the off island boat trip to a small undeveloped tiny island where we would have food and drinks prepared by the boat captain.  We headed out early the next morning to meet with the boat captain and leave for our excursion.  The captain was a middle aged man with a pleasant demeanor.  The waters were a little choppy that day and the kids ended up getting sea sick.  I thought to myself please let this boat trip end soon.  The captain let us off at the small island while he stayed aboard to cook us lunch. My family and I went snorkeling and saw some beautiful sea life all around us.  The kids and I were amazed at how beautiful this little piece of paradise was.  We got out of the ocean and dried off.  There were a few sprinkles to start but nothing major.  We were getting hungry and could smell the food being prepared on the captains boat.  All of the sudden a huge gust of wind came barreling through, the skies darkened and the waves picked up.  It started pouring rain as the boat started sloshing back and forth through the waves.  The storm caused the anchor on the boat to become unhinged and the boat was adrift without an anchor.  The captain tried to get the boat close enough to shore but was fighting off every inch of water and waves.  After about four hours the sea calmed and my husband swam out to the boat and was able to bring the small dingy to get us from the island to the boat. We made it back to the resort unharmed.  My family found it to be exciting and exhilarating, something unexpected, full of wonder and a little nerves but an experience to always remember.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8DBYB14L,0.0

I did not think I was ever going to be married. I really thought I was going to die alone. I know that sounds dark, but I mean I did not think I was ever going to find anyone because I had no luck whatsoever dating. But in the end, I was wrong about that, and I am glad. I met her in the most random place, which was some random brewery. I did not even see her at first and she came up to me and asked about beer.  I love talking about beer and that is something I can talk about for a long time. That conversation led into just a normal conversation about each other and it went from there. It was nice to be able to slowly go through a relationship and see it progress. It was something I was not used to at all. It was really a learning experience, but a good one. It was the process of getting to know someone and realizing you love each other. Its pretty sweet looking back on it, and its something that I think is more than okay looking back on. I just think that it was something I was not expecting, but would tell anyone to never pass up if you have the chance.

I had been dreading such a thing and now it has happened. Ms. Fong sold the property and the new owners are looking at making as much money out of it as they can. We know the drill, don't we? They are jacking up the rents as much as they legally can. Then, when people leave because they can't afford their rent anymore, their apartments are going to be renovated and then rented for a ridiculous amount of money. It happened to us when we were on 7th Street and it's happening again! One day, three will be zero affordable apartments left in this city for regular middle class people like us. And still, the streets around here are filled with young people who seem to work from home, have coffee in fancy coffee shops at 11 AM and look like struggling artists, yet can afford prohibitively expensive dwellings. Who are those people? What kind of job do they have? Writers maybe, although I've never thought that writing could be that profitable. Or they started some kind of startup and they're swimming in money because they struck gold with their brilliant new concept. Meanwhile, almost everyone I know is struggling financially even though we've all been to nice colleges and have decent paying jobs. I guess New York is not for regular people anymore.

I am a Biology/Computer Science Major at a 4-year university. I was chosen from more than 300 students to travel to Maine and participate in a Biology research project. This trip is an all-expense paid trip during the semester and includes a $1000 dollar stipend. I was in disbelief when I was told by my mentor that I had been chosen. This is a very high honor for myself. I had some struggles at the beginning of my college education. I have worked extremely hard to get my grades and my attitude back to the top. The most important part of this event is the fact that the outcome of the experiment will be published. This is something that is of the utmost importance to anyone who writes. Being a published author/scientist is very important when I am applying for graduate school. This honor that I was chosen for will be at the end of this month. I am so very excited to travel to Maine as I have never traveled further north than North Carolina. I have just completed a written assignment that I will present to the audience on the first day of the project. The Biology chair at my university only had to make one correction to my 12 page paper. He stated I was the first student that received this honor where the paper didn't have to be re-written. This opportunity gives me the much-needed push to forge ahead with my application to graduate school. With the publication of the experiment on my Curriculum Vitae, I am almost assured an acceptance into graduate school. The $1000 dollar stipend/scholarship is a very welcome bonus as I am a starving student.  This opportunity will allow doors to open for me that would not have opened otherwise. I will be forever thankful to the committee that chose me for this project. I will also stop dwelling on my past mistakes as I have shown that I can overcome many challenges in my life. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity for myself. I will be certain to do the very best job when in Maine. I will give 100% of myself to this research. I am excited and looking forward to what I can offer the scientific community when the time comes",3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4FVM4CY,,0.0

I had to go to target to pick up a prescription and a few other things I needed. During my time at Target I ended up running into someone I used to know. I knew this person back from college days at the university. Had a decent amount of time together. we were pretty good friends during that time but it's been years since then. we didn't date or anything but we were close. we had a nice little conversation at the time we met at target. after all was said and done we hugged and talked some more and eventually came to the decision that we would talk to each other again.

It was a bit of a road trip that made it a hassle to arrive on time.  Unfortunately, they changed the venue at the last moment and I didn't get the notification.  Now I hadn't seen this uncle for probably approaching 15 years.  So my recollection of him was hazy.  Plus time changes us all.  So we finally arrived after wading through traffic for the last 2 hours.  Somehow, we ended up on time.  We entered the hotel, and refreshed in their restroom quick.  Next we found the conference room that was where the reception should have been in full swing.  As we entered the room I scanned around looking for relatives I would recognize.  I started to get a bit concerned that there weren't any familiar faces.  We slid into some empty seats by the back wall and looked around for a bit.  As I started to explain to my date that something might be sorely wrong, and older fellow sat down next to us.  He stated telling us stories about the groom, his nephew William.  Problem was, my uncles name was Ed.  Wrong wedding.  So we hastily made a exit and a few phone calls later were on our way to the correct venue.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREJT00L3,,0.0

I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.  There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.  During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up.  Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out.  This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone.  I break off alone and walk through the store to find something in particular and this familiar voice calls my name.  I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.  I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.  Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of.  We walked towards each other, stunned, and embraced one another.  For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything.  Finally, after two minutes or so she whispered in my ear, ""I miss you"".  I walked around with her that night and we talked for a while and caught up.  She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.  By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in.  I ended up calling her again.  It would probably turn out to be a mistake but realistically, even through all of the rough patches, she was the only one that really made sense to me.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,0.0

I e-mailed him about my interest in potentially meeting with him to talk about my interest about attending the school and shadowing him during his rounds.  We e-mailed back and forth, and he eventually asked me if I could come in to meet with him that day. I was thrown off because I didn't expect him to have time today, and I wasn't prepared for what I would say and how I would make a good impression. I quickly printed out my personal statement, prior application, and CV, and drove to the school. When I met with him, I walked into his office and was surprised to see another person my age. The professor exclaimed that he managed to get the kid into another medical school not too far away that I had applied to in the past. This definitely seemed like a power move to me, as it showed that he obviously either knew what he was doing regarding admissions or at least had some pull. It made me kind of nervous because I didn't feel super prepared. He pulled me into another room where we talked about my application. He read my application, and said that I was a decent but not great candidate, but definitely had a shot to get into at least some school this cycle. That was a huge relief for me, as this is actually my third cycle applying and my MCAT result was about to expire. However, he read my personal statement and said that it was a bit redundant in themes, but had some parts that he liked. We walked outside into the hallway and into a conference room, where he pulled out two current medical students. He asked them to help me with my application, which was again to me a huge power move.  I was surprised because they both seemed really open to helping me, with my personal statement and the application process in general. This went on for about an hour, and I felt bad that I was keeping them from other things. I eventually left, and was pleasantly surprised about how helpful everyone was.",3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNCIJP2,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNCIJP2,0.0

He came down from his military base up north. We have a tradition of drinking a bottle of wine each every time he comes to visit. This time we decided to hike to the nearest graveyard soon after he got here. This time after we both drank our wine bottles. So around 2am or so, we both sneak out of the house and start walking towards the graveyard. The graveyard was pretty far, around a mile or so away. There is a shortcut through a wooded section that saves a little bit of time, and we decided to use that. It was very dark and quiet in the woods. About half way through the shortcut, we heard a coyote howl that sounded pretty close. Needless to say, it made us both jump and we picked up speed to be out of the woods quicker. After getting outside the woods we slowed down again. When we got to the graveyard, there was several bats flying around making chirping noises. It was really cool seeing them out like that. I remember we both enjoyed it a lot.",3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNDRPJJ,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUNDRPJJ,0.0

The summer before my grandfather died, so I knew it was important to spend time with my grandma because we never know how much time someone has left on earth. During my week long visit, I made sure that I went and spent extra time with my grandma. I helped her do chores around her house, run errands for her, and just help anyway that I could. I made sure that I had deep and meaningful conversations with her. We talked about life and I got her advice on somethings that I thought were important. During the rest of my visit I hung out with my other family members and we did a lot of fun things. We went skating, to the library, to a softball game and shopping. Other days we visited different family members. And most days we lounged by the pool soaking up the sun. I really had a lot of fun. And of course I enjoyed seeing everyone.

I always stay with her about a week each summer with my 3 children. She lives there with my uncle and her two children. We look forward to it every year. It is a special visit always. But this year was extra special. My granny, who lives right now the road, is very sick with an incurable disease. She very likely will not be here on earth for our next visit next summer. So I made a point to visit her and spend extra time with her. When I arrived I was take aback because she was much sicker than she was the last time I saw her.  I sat and talked with her, helped her around the house, and ran errands for her. I visited her on numerous days this visit. Last year, her husband, my grandpa, died. So I know how important it is to spend time with her because it may be limited. As a matter of fact, my grandpa died one week after my visit last year and I was so grateful that I made a point to spend time with him. During my visit with my granny I had deep conversations with my her. She told me details about her life that I did not know,  and gave my advice about my own life. I will cherish that forever. I also spent a lot of time with my various family members, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. We had a blast as always. We sat by the pool and sunbathed. We went to softball games. We went to a skating rink and out to eat. We played with puppies. Overall, the visit was perfect, and made even better with time spent with my granny.",3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUO6RJP0,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUO6RJP0,0.0

I never thought that that would happen to me. I immediately began to worry about finding another job and how I would pay my bills on time. I didn't have much of a savings at the time.

I always thought that I might go back to school but being fired made me really consider it. I have been doing well by being really careful with money while I look for a new job in a totally different field.

She is a very smart girl with so much potential but for some reason she did not want me to succeed. I experienced some things I would have never imagined. Things like messing with files I have worked on or flat out deleting them. I caught on and started saving my work in my own UBS but she was on a mission to get me out.

It occurred in an area that I frequent, I was there the night before and I had plans to be there that night, but I had been out too late the night before and was hungover and tired. People I know and am very close live and work there, so it was stressful to say the least. Spending that night reaching out to people that I knew down there, and getting phone calls from people I knew around the country reaching out to make sure I was OK was emotional in both a negative and a positive way. Worrying about people and knowing there are people all over the country caring about you was an unique experience. It was a night without much sleep. Afterwards my city came together in an amazing way. Everyone was out supporting local businesses much more than they usually do. The restaurants and bars were busy beyond their normal capacity. People were hugging on the streets. Everyone was wearing shirts to support the city. Celebrities from all over the country were showing support. Everywhere I went people were kinder than normal. Even random people on the street were more affectionate and caring. It was truly an unique experience.",,3YOH7BII0ATXOZ3PA3XW544PWMIKVO,0.0

I knew I loved her and would be happy to keep dating her, but I more and more felt I really wanted to make the full commitment. Eight years together and we've been through a lot, and nothing to make me think at all about breaking up. But it had to be a special moment when I finally asked her the question, and I just couldn't think how to make it something really memorable. I didn't want to propose when we were out for pizza or something ordinary like that! And then when we talked about going to the beach for a vacation, that just seemed so perfect. I knew I had to do it. The beach vacation was everything I thought it would be, and something so special to her as it was her first time. Walking along the boardwalk, playing the games, and of course the beach itself. She was so happy, having an absolute blast whether we were relaxing on the sand or playing in the water. So finally the perfect opportunity presented itself. We decided on the spur of the moment to go for a walk along the beach and enjoy the sunset, then get dinner afterwards. Thank goodness I had an excuse to wear something with pockets! I had the ring of course, and when we walked around one crop of rocks and saw the sun sparkling across the water, we both just stopped and looked for a few moments. That was it, I knew it'd never be more romantic than that. So of course I did the whole down-on-one-knee thing, which was goofy but it just felt right. As soon as that happened she knew what was coming and she started tearing up, and I don't know what I said but she said yes and it was perfect, absolutely perfect. We hugged, we kissed, we took a bunch of photos so we could share it later - and then went out for pizza! Maybe not the most romantic dinner, I know, but it didn't matter, it was great pizza and she was wearing my ring and we were both overjoyed. I just realized it's been two months! I still get such a kick out of referring to ""my fiancee"", and now we're talking about the wedding plans it's clear I did absolutely the right thing! This will be my wife soon!",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,0.0

We tried to make our parents understand our point of view but you know how South Asian families are when it comes to caste and religion. Only thing Oshan and I knew that very day back in April was that we were going to get married that month and we were going to go ahead with our plans no matter what obstacles we would have to face. See, Asian families have this idea of who a perfect partner for your child is. The thing they don't understand is that they want their child to marry a stranger just because they like that person, not even considering the opinion or the choice of their own child. Our case was similar. He was tall and I was short, I was a bit on the chubby side and I wore glasses. The only issue his family had with me was that I was fat, ugly and a christian. Too bad they didn't realize that I was a warrior. There was this one time when his father actually told my father that I was fat, and my father responded saying, ""I feed my children well and unlike your kids mine aren't malnourished.""! My parents were supportive of our marriage and relationship unlike his parents. Getting back to April, we decided we would get married after witnessing our families fight with each other regarding our relationship for nearly 2 years. On the 28th we went ahead as planned, at my house. Just like that we got married! No big wedding, just us and a few close friends and a good BBQ! I still remember the tiny little details just like yesterday. I was excited and so was he. He got me flowers in the morning to decorate and they were white and yellow. The skies were a bit dark and all of us were worried that it might rain in the evening, and it sure did! He came over with his friends in the pouring rain and was wearing a light grey suit. I was in an emerald green dress with a bouquet of flowers made with yellow, white and green. It was beautiful. Everything went according to plan. The only people missing were his family. They refused to come.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6F27K3J,0.0

He was being given is his sheriff's badge and officially accepted into the sheriff's department. We had to go to the courthouse area really early and at 7 am we were led into the compound of buildings and into a secured area. The sheriff came and gave a speech before pining a badge on each one of the new sheriff's shirts. I used my phone to film the whole process. I also looked around while they were talking and I saw very interesting photos of sheriffs going back to the 1800's. There were also photos of many sheriffs on the wall of the facility who had died. It was emotional when the sheriff spoke because he talked about how family was the real reason that they did what they do and it was clear that he meant it. The most surprising moment was when they were told that training started right away. I expecting to get to spend the day with my brother since we even had family in town and it happened to me my birthday but he had to stay and we had to leave. The event was still significant to me and I was glad I got to witness it because it's not something I've probably have the opportunity to do again. I also think it was important for me to be there to support him. I think it makes a difference when you have family who support your career choice. I also have considered law enforcement in the past but I've always decided against it. That doesn't mean I don't think that its a job someone has to do and I'm proud someone in my family is capable of filling that tole.,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6VWC3KB,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6VWC3KB,0.0

We had not found out the sex beforehand, but we were both hoping for a baby girl, and that's what we got!  My wife got induced at 6 a.m. and didn't have the baby until 12:17 the next a.m.  She was a champ the whole time.  When it came time to push, it was all very exciting and happened so quickly.  I cut the umbilical cord which I was hesitant about, but I am so glad I did it.  When the baby came out and they told us it was a girl, pure joy ran across both of our faces.  She was a big, healthy girl.  Almost 9 pounds!  We fell in love in that instant and fall in love more every day.  It was the happiest day of our lives and it has only gotten better.  10/10 would highly recommend.",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943677II1U2,0.0

I got to spend time with a lot of my family all at the same time, including some members that I don't get to see often. I had a wonderful day for the most part, and we had a lot of fun with our families. However, there was a couple unexpected events that made the day less than perfect. For starters, my MIL was being mean and said some negative things about me to my own father. She was not the only one that caused some issues during my wedding. My husband's aunt decided to take it upon herself to cut my wedding cake. Not only did she cut the cake without asking, she also destroyed the cake and ruining the top tier that my husband and I were planning to save for later for just the two of us. She made a mess out of our special piece, and offered it to guests. When removing our top layer, she dropped in on it's side on another plate. I will never forgive her for what she did, as the cake cutting was something that I had been looking forward to and planning since we first started planning the wedding. Even though it really upset me, I decided I wasn't going to show my anger or make a big scene. My close family knew that it upset me and helped make me feel better. I didn't want to ruin the day completely, so I just decided to continue on with the day and enjoy spending time with the people I actually care about and care about me. I avoided the aunt throughout the entire day.",3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943677LH1U7,,0.0

Oh, how much I needed this vacation. I was out in the mountains, where I did not have any cell phone connection. I spent my days reading my books and just enjoying the nature. I didn't go hiking or kayaking. I simply took my time to relax and recharge. This vacation helped me get over my depression. I came back to my home and to my work with a completely new perspective.

It was going to be a bit difficult because some of the classes were on another campus in a neighboring city. It kind of worried me because my car is older and has had some trouble and I didn't want it to break down during any of the trips. Also I wasn't sure I would be able to afford the gas cost. I am a full-time student, so I don't have a full-time job. It was only twice a week, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I ended up meeting some folks that were taking the same classes as me that also went to the other campus. We got to talking and figured out a ride-sharing schedule that allowed us to rotate who drove each other to and from the campuses. Like one person would drive this week and then another would drive next week and the next week I would drive, etc. That way no one person had to put the mileage on their car and we all chipped in for gas. I was so thankful that I met that group, because I was really having trouble making ends meet with how much gas I was using making those trips. It doesn't seem like much, but even a few bucks can make the difference for a college student. I like carpooling because we get to talk about a lot of things on the ride. I found out that Bob and I like the same hockey team and we are going to go to a game next week. I also learned that Jan is from my same hometown, we went to different highschools but we used to hang out at some of the same places. I'm really lucky that I found these folks and that I get along so well with them. It would be hard to be stuck in a car with people you didn't get along with for a couple hours just to save some gas money!",,3YWRV122CTLDGJCOWOQOJDTFXB88UZ,0.0

He has worked so hard, for so long. It was wonderful to see him recognized for all he's put into scouting. Many of our family and friends came which made it even more of an event to remember. He also had a part in the ceremony where he thanked everyone and told about what he'd learned over the years. As he came to each person, he told a little story about them and even came to tears several times. It was very emotional for me. He's 18 years old now so he's been in that period where he doesn't want to show his emotions to anyone, though he let his guard down at the ceremony. Several times I remember taking a look around to see all the people who were there to support him and it warmed my heart. I could not ask for a better kid. I think that was solidified in the way he presented himself at the ceremony. It will definitely be an event I will remember for the rest of my life. I know the ceremony had the same effect on many others there as well. I talked about it with my parents and they were surprised by how emotional my son was and thought it was a breath of fresh air to see a kid express himself openly like that.  It was the same for my wife and many others I spoke to.",3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYE8DCUW,,0.0

The first sister-in-law, S, already has 4 children, and this will be her 5th. The second sister-in-law, T, is now several months into her 3rd pregnancy. I was very happy for them both, especially because T struggled with miscarriages and infertility before she was able to have her second child. This third baby was a welcome surprise for T. However, this is a touchy subject for me because it is possible that I may be physically unable to have children due to PCOS. Therefore, upon their announcement at a family gathering, I congratulated them and then had to excuse myself because I could not hold in my emotions. I went to the bathroom so I could privately cry and relieve some of the pain their announcement brought up. The rest of the get-together was rough and I had to work very hard to keep myself from showing my painful emotions. I do not think I was very successful because I was asked several times if I was okay. Each announcement through the years has been difficult, but this was the hardest of them all. Although I will love my new nieces and nephews when they get here, and I will attend their showers, it will not be easy to be around the celebrations without a feeling of emptiness and failure on my end. I have always wanted to be a mother. The experience of pregnancy is very, very important to me. I don't expect my sister-in-laws to take my feelings and fears into account, and I don't know how to express this situation to them.",,3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYN2TCU9,0.0

I never would have thought in my wildest dreams that I'd ever have breast cancer.  After all, I'm a guy!  I always thought it was a woman's illness.  Until that day a few months back, gosh, I remember it so clearly.  I stepped out of the shower and was drying myself.  And there it was.  At first I thought it was an insect or bite.  When I felt closer and looked in the mirror I knew it was something else.  I kept touching it the whole night and my friend told me on the phone to get it checked out.  But we both didn't think it could be breast cancer.  Then, the doctor said those two words.  I was in disbelief.  I even asked him, but Doc, I'm a guy!  As if that would change things.  I'll never forget that wave of panic and fear that swept over me.  One minute I was on top of the world, the next, under it.  I felt like I couldn't walk.  Like I was less of a man.  I didn't even want to asknowledge it.  Still today, despite getting treated, I am in shock and despair.  I can only pray that it goes away and never comes back.

For an all-ages show, guests of all ages are welcome with an admission ticket. Children age 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult. Most of the concerts at the House of Blues Orlando are general admission. General admission means that there's no reserved seats in the audience; in fact, on the main concert floor, there are no seats at all. Concert-goers simply stand wherever they can. There are a few seats around the perimeter of the floor Located 4.9 miles from the Orange County Convention Center, House of Blues accommodates 15 to 2,500 guests, and our talented staff handles every detail, so you don't have to! On any given day, guest attire ranges from business suits and dresses to fashionable jeans and t-shirts. House of Blues would like to thank you for not wearing tank tops, sleeveless shirts (men only), gym wear or casual shorts, which are not permitted in the Foundation Room. Dress shorts are acceptable. Disney Springs. Disney Springs (previously known as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village in 1975, Walt Disney World Village in 1977, Disney Village Marketplace in 1989, and Downtown Disney in 1997) is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near OrlandoGigs usually last between 2 and 3 hours, it depends how many supports there are and how quick at setting up they are in between. Most gigs with doors of 6.30 start between 7 and 8 and finish between 10 and 11....The House of Blues is an American chain of live music concert halls and restaurants. It was founded by Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, and Dan Aykroyd, co-star of the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. A new band might only have 10 songs, while a band like U2 has dozens at least. I'd say if you have 3 or more albums, a 90-minute show should be the minimum. But I remember being disappointed the first time I saw Depeche Mode, as well as a NIN concert I saw, each of which were only 90 minutes. If you've got a 30-45 minute set then I'd say about 7-10 songs, depending on how long your songs are, and how much stage banter you do. If you arrange a gig, the venue or promoter should tell you how long your set will be, and if they don't, there's no harm in asking.",,3Z4GS9HPNWW7IUV99B57VLJ05MJ77Q,0.0

I was led into the living room by my girlfriend where 80% of my friends were gathered waiting to give me more surprises. As I entered the room I jump in the air and screamed, I have never felt so loved before in my life. Party started soon after, I mingled with my friends and had a chat with my close relatives that also came. We danced, eat a lot of steaks, hot dogs, pizzas and a hot of others with enough bear to go round. II didn't even have a plan for my birthday a day before but was really surprised by how my lady handled everything. fast forward to when everyone already had a lot of fu partying at home. My girlfriend told me she got a ticket for us to see Titanic. We kissed all through the movie and had to leave early when some guys got uncomfortable with our ""PDA"".

I did not talk to him much. He did not talk to me. We were focused on getting there. I know he was thinking about the last time he had seen him and if he could have done more to take care of his father. I tried to just get him there in one piece and be there for him. We worried about his mother. I knew his father had been ailing, but they had said he was getting better. I was tired and he was tired. The road was busy because rather than waiting for the best time when there would be less traffic, we had set out immediately. His parents had taken care of all the arrangements before hand. They had bought a policy ten years before. However, the funeral home still made a play for more money. It was really upsetting to everyone. It was the first time I had heard his mother curse. There was a wrangle over writing the obituary. The funeral home included basically and advertisement for themselves by adding information about them. Of course my mother-in-law had to pay it, but by then it was too late. I sat next to my mother in law and held her hand. She was stoic the entire time. Afterward, she tried to take care of us and we had to let her, because I knew it was a welcome distraction.",,3Z4XG4ZF49D5XN6J1T1B3KSJFGQ8XQ,0.0

Two weeks ago, my father died. The man I had known my entire life, looked up to my entire life, just no longer existed. Something that I had always known was there, suddenly was not. It was difficult to deal with, as most death is, but his spirit and the memories I have of him will never disappear. And I learned this a week later, when things finally came to it's normalcy. I had spent the entire day hanging out in the yard and the hills and decided to go up that evening and dig up some of my childhood toys for the kids and there it was, the pistol my dad bought me when I was a kid. It was a piece of crap, of course; rusted and dusted. A children's toy meant to shoot wooden pellets, something I'm sure the political correctness of this generation would frown on. I brought the gun down from the attic and told my son to come over and bring his friends and I taught them out to use it. They had watched us old fogeys shoot on the range for the better portion of the day, I suppose their turn was coming. The moldy box of pellets still had a few usable pieces of ammunition and I drew a bulls-eye on the side of the house and let them play target practice. A couple of times, I had to warn the kids of the safety of pointing it in each other's face but watching them play with a potentially dangerous yet fun piece of my childhood brought those tears and memories right back to me. The times we had were well spent. The times I'm having with my kid and someone else's kids are also well spent. So, this was when I realized that this is how things are supposed to be.

I'm usually a very sociable person, but I haven't had a chance to meet too many people. I've been working a lot. So I downloaded an app to see if I could meet some new people for friends.

She was looking for new friends as well, so it sounded perfect. Doesn't mean it wasn't completely awkward. We met at the shop and got our drinks. We didn't really say much at first, just smiled as we waited in line. She intimidated me a bit. She was gorgeous, and that always makes me feel on edge. Gorgeous women usually don't talk to me. So it was nice being with her but a little unnerving as well. We made small talk for a bit, but I ran out of things to say quicker than I would've liked. That led to some awkward silences. But she seemed to understand it. We both knew that making new friends would be hard. We agreed to hang out again in a few days. Hopefully it goes better this time.

It started with throwing up more, and losing a bit of weight.  I just assumed it was part of him getting older, nothing more.  Then one day I noticed he was laying down in an awkward position, and wouldn't sleep.  I took him to the vet, and when they called me in to that special room where they give you terrible news, time just stopped.  He had advanced liver cancer, and there was not much hope.  I fell apart right then and there - Buddy was my entire world.  He had seen us through good times and bad, and was our ever constant companion.  I called Josh, and told him to come home through the sobs.  The vet gave us our options that included an aggressive dialysis schedule, or comfort measures.  I couldn't bear the thought of not having Buddy, so we went with the aggressive dialysis schedule.  I took him 3 times a week to the animal hospital, and would sit with him for hours before taking him home.  I held out hope for a few months, but it became apparent that he was still deteriorating.  Josh convinced me that it was time to let Buddy go.  The vet came to our house so Buddy would be kept comfortable.

It took a toll on us when she realized after going to the hospital that she had developed a stage 4 cancer in her glands. She was very hesitant about it but didn't stop with her life and continued to persevere. Later days, she would still laugh and joke and believe it was all in God's favor. The family believed in healing, as well. Sadly, the doctors told us there was nothing they could do and let her be in piece. Those days counting up to her death were unbearable for the rest of us, but she didn't give in at all and gave it all her fight. There are still most days when I miss my aunt. I sometimes even have trouble focusing on one particular subject. I get comfort from family members here and there. At night, I always pray and sometimes ask God to let me hear my auntie. She was always an inspirational person as I still feel it through her death. Her teachings have stuck with me and I continue to move with her legacy in mind. Another thing that we'll always have in common is the love for food! Can't get enough!",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O257CCX1,0.0

I was approached by the pastor at my church in regards to teaching Vacation Bible School. I have to say I was shocked at the thought of teaching children about the Bible. It is a subject that I struggle to understand myself.  I voiced this concern to my pastor. He told me that is the reason he wanted me to take the role of the teacher. His believed this experience would help me understand the teachings of the Bible and at the same time benefit the children. After careful consideration, I agreed to teach Vacation Bible School. I must say this endeavor turned out to be one of the best decisions I have ever made. I was assigned to a class of 7-9 year-olds. The children in this age group were inquisitive and full of wonder. I immersed myself fully into each lesson. The decision that I made to undertake this challenge was one of the best I have ever made. I learned more about the Bible during that week than I had learned in my entire life. The children were responsible for opening my mind up to all the things that were confusing to me concerning the teachings of the Bible.  The children had an awareness that I hadn't before this week of teaching. They graciously shared their stories and opinions on the lessons I was teaching. That was one of the best weeks in my life. I am so glad that I participated in the event. My pastor was right about this aiding in my understanding of the teachings of the Bible. During that week of Vacation Bible School, many of the questions that were always pulling at my mind were answered by innocent children. The memory of that week will forever be in my heart.",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O261UXCT,0.0

Our children have been too young to go on a real vacation and we have not had the money to be able to go until now.  We decided this summer that our children were old enough to real enjoy it and we had saved up enough money. We travelled to the coast of our state and stayed in a nice hotel. We ate a several nice restaurants and saw several attractions. The biggest part of our trip was going to a large water park. We bought our tickets ahead of time and were worried the weather might ruin our plans but luck for us the weather was wonderful the day of our visit. We got to the water park as soon as they opened. It wasn't too crowded at that point. We went to all the big slides as soon as we got in to try to avoid long waits. Our first big slide was so much fun. The looks on my kids' faces when we go to the bottom was worth the whole trip. My daughter and I went on one slide together 7 times in a row. We had lunch at the park, a huge cheese pizza split between all of us. By lunch time it was getting crowded but we were still having a good time. We stayed for another 3 hours. By then we were all getting exhausted. We went back to the hotel and cleaned up. At that point it was time for dinner so we walked across the parking lot to a Buffalo Wild Wings. The kids played arcade games while we waited on our dinner. After dinner we walked next door to a rolled ice cream shop. We got the kids big bowls of rolled ice cream. They couldn't finish them but it was worth it. We went back to the hotel and put on a movie. We were all asleep before it was over.",,3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O25XPXCF,0.0

We recently went snowboarding in the high country and my daughter got two really good days in on the slopes.  The comparison between skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding is loose, with each having their own intricacies, but the base balance is the same.  We put in extra work at the skate park before we headed up north, and I tried to help her work on balance more than tricks.  Rolling in on the bigger ramps and boxes and trying to speed around the park without taking her feet off the board were key in simulating the snowboard experience.  But the one thing we could not account for was the bindings and/or the fixing of the feet to the board.  This is a very unnatural feeling and hard to simulate or get used to when first on a snowboard, but I think the work we did in the skate park was beneficial. We put her in a lesson to start the trip and she gained confidence from the instructor, who was not her dad, and learned the basics of movement, stopping, and keeping a tow or heel edge.  On our first trip up the lift, she seemed confident but also had some trepidation.  I encouraged her with my early experiences and tales of how long it took me to be able to get down a run without falling.  We both fell getting off the lift and I think that put her at ease a bit, to see me fall and recover to help her exit the landing zone.  Once we were strapped in she had some issue adjusting to the steepness of the run, as it was much steeper than the hill she took the lesson on.  I helped her get her heel plow down and told her it was the easiest way to stop or slow down if she got going too fast.  Initially, the heel side riding is easier because the muscles are stronger and the angle is better to ""dig your heels in"" rather than try to dig your toes in - at first at least.  The first run was very frustrating for her after feeling like she did well in the lessons, but I was so proud of her to want to get back on the lift after some tears, screams, and bumps and bruises.  Again a proud dad moment and it got better through out the two days - way better.  She was right on the edge of getting the feeling of snowboarding in control and I could see her confidence boost after each run.  I'm sure the two days snowboarding will improve her skateboarding and I'm eager to get to the skate park this weekend!",3Z7EFSHGNA079QWWI5HG56O2637XCA,,0.0

My brother in law Mike is going through a tough time. His wife is in the process of filling divorce paperwork. This trip was a good time for Mike to get away from the normal life and spend time with friends. The last night we were in town we were looking for a place to eat. We were walking in down town Indianapolis and Mike suggested an area that had a ""Steak and Shake."" We all gave him a hard time because we didn't want to go to a place we can eat at back home. We wanted something unique. We ended up getting an Uber back to our hotel and went to a local restaurant and bar. At the bar my brother in law Mike had a LOT to drink. He had 2 pitchers of bear and 2 shots. I have seen my brother in law drink, but never that much! He was gone! We went back to the hotel, but Mike couldn't walk. At the hotel he want to Matt, Todd and Garrets room and was keeping them awake. I was able to get Mike back to our room, and after laying down he said he had to go to the bathroom. It took him 10 minutes to get to the bathroom. On the way to the bathroom he saw a bottle of liquor and 2 beer bottles and said ""I'm coming back for you.""

Without any hesitation, I said yes and started to plan my trip.  I drove from California to Pennsylvania and visited lots of beautiful sites that my friend would have also enjoyed.  I finally made it to Pittsburgh after four days of driving and returned the car back to his family.  I spent a week in the hospital visiting my friend, because on my road trip he ended up having a seizure and had to be admitted.  My friend had looked a lot different from the last time I saw him.  It broke my heart but I knew it would make me stronger.  Every single day I spent at the hospital to be there with his family. In this time, I really grew with his parents who I never really knew before.  I was able to get in contact with lots of friends who had no idea he was in the hospital and they were able to pay him a visit. I felt like I was able to send an army to help his family deal with all of this.  While in Pittsburgh, I was staying with my parents, and I do not get along with my dad well.  But going to the hospital brought me comfort and joy even though it was such a sad time.  When it was finally time to leave to fly back to California, my friend's dad dropped me off at the hospital.  We had a deep conversation and when it was time to step out of the car, I gave him the biggest hug I ever gave someone in my life.  I will always remember that hug.",3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UPXRZ8H,3Z7ISHFUH1HU2I6Y2BPW058UPXRZ8H,0.0

Really super chill guys, they are originally from ireland and decided to one day start a bar. I don't normally pick up girls at the bar. I usually tend to shy away from everybody and go to the corner of the bar. I didn't lose my virginity until the age 25 so this day is worth writing about to be honest with you. Anyway I had a good time at the end of the day. I was watching the game on tv with a my pint of guinness. When in comes in this lady with her friend, who was rather large. The first girl was really attractive and I was hoping to get her phone number. So we started drinking shots and I might have drank too much. No I drank way too much, who am I kidding. Things got a little too carried away and I woke up with the attractive girl's friend, the large lady by my side.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM2GK1Z3,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM2GK1Z3,0.0

My beloved dog, Jesse, passed away while I sat with him in his final moments. He was 13 years old and I never expected to lose him at that age. I always thought he would be with me for many years and that we would share many memories together. Unfortunately, our time was cut short and I had to say a very painful goodbye to him. He passed unexpectedly so I didn't have time to emotionally prepare for the loss. The day before, something told me that I needed to take a day and take him out and have a good time. We went out for a ride and went to Burger King, one of his favorite places to eat. He had a cheeseburger with bacon and he ate almost the whole thing. I brought him home that night and took him to bed like usual. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed that he was having a hard time breathing. I covered him up with a blanket. I knew that by the time I could call the vet, he wouldn't still be with me. I cried as I sat with him, petting him softly and keeping him calm by letting him know I was there with him and wouldn't leave him. I could see him leaving me as his breathing started to get slower. As much as i wanted to beg and plead for him to stay with me, I couldn't stand to see him suffer. Once I knew he passed, I sat with him for another few minutes. I couldn't bring myself to move; it was almost as if I was frozen. I couldn't believe I had to say goodbye to my loyal best friend that had been with me for so long. He was, and will always be my Jesse. As I look around my house today, it is almost like I can still feel him and hear him around me. I know he will always be with me in spirit.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM9B7Z1L,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM9B7Z1L,0.0

There were a lot of memorable things that made the event special. However, the most memorable was when I realized that I had actually won the election itself. This was significant in that it started a new chapter in my life. I was going to be starting a new job as an elected official, that meant having new things to learn about. I was also going to be in the public eye and needed to do some soul searching regarding behaviors and things I participated in. It was almost like a complete transformation except my mind was the same. This event opened up so many networking doors and now has promoted me to start my MBA (which will be finished in January of 2021) and proceed to take the LSAT and hopefully accomplish my dream of getting my law license. During the event, I learned a lot about myself including my goals and my drive. I challenged myself to disregard negative comments and focus on the goal at hand. This was a deep process for me and I feel that I came out of it stronger and better as a person. To be the first female and republican in 100 years gives me great pride. I value the accomplishment and it fuels me to be better. I am constantly making my father and mother proud with my accomplishments. I look forward to where this road takes me.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMA41Z12,,0.0

Even though the event was sudden, the process was long and intense. I am very proud of my accomplishment and where I have come. The event that I am describing is my first direct experience being a political candidate in a local election. I experienced all sections of the process from getting my name on the ballot, to fundraising, to strategy, etc. While there were many memorable parts in retrospective thinking, the most memorable part was when we figured out I was the first in my political party to hold the particular office when I was elected, the first female in history and the youngest to ever be elected to the position. This is significant to me because of the struggles to prove myself to my community and my generation. There were a lot of uphill battles to prove my work ethic and my desire to serve. I am reminded daily of this event by going to work and continuing my service to my constituents. I am constantly reminded by the hurdles I overcame by being a single female on the ballot. The reminders of election night, and my father swearing my in and my first day in office will forever be a part of my memory. Daily I am faced with new found struggles. Those struggles remind me of what I went through and why I went through it. This milestone in my life has promoted me to be a better citizen and person.

When I got fired I went into a bad depression and I didn't think I would be able to overcome the job loss. It took me a long time to start to feel better and to overcome the anxiety that went with it. I always worked hard for my boss and I went above and beyond my job duties. They felt that I didn't do enough so 5 months ago they decided just to replace me. I just came in one day and they informed me that my services were not needed anymore. I felt lost and also insulted that I would be thrown aside like that without any explanation. I tried to put things out of my mind by drinking and sleeping all day long. I couldn't understand why no one would hire me after this and it took many interviews to find something after they got rid of me. I hate to think back about it now and when I do I get really worried that it will happen again at any time. It has affected me mentally even at my day job now because I think back about the bad experience I had. I try to set it aside but it's always in my mind that I could be fired even if I make a small mistake. It has hampered my progress at times because I am worried about failure now. Not just in my professional life but also in my personal life. I try not to think back but for some reason the details of the event keep coming back to me and making me feel anxious and sweat. Even finding a new job has not made these feelings go away so I wonder if I should get some type of therapy for these issues.,,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMLP31ZN,0.0

I recall how hard it was raining that night as it had to be raining extremely hard to leak into the house , enough to soak my laptop. If the laptop lid had been closed it probably would not have  shorted out the electronics but since it was open the water went directly in between the keys on the keypad and into the internal electronics. At the time I was too busy working each day to spend a lot of effort trying to salvage the computer and so I left it sitting out to hopefully dry and went back to work to earn the money to replace it. I had recently started a new job and was mostly focused on doing a good job but this laptop was also my backup work computer and useful at times in completing tasks related to my job and home life. I have since purchased a replacement laptop computer and have recovered from this event but do still think often about how devastating it was at the time to lose one of my work computers as it was essential to my being able to earn money to pay my bills. I have since placed a temporary cap on the chimney that leaked and plan to work more on properly sealing the chimney to permanently prevent all future water leakage. I also have been planning to purchase 1 more additional laptop , partially to have a backup computer in case one of my current work computers becomes unusable as I do not want to struggle as before. At the time I was able to borrow a laptop from my mother and she has since given me that laptop computer.  I am grateful to have her help as I was able to then quickly begin earning money again and have since recovered financially from the loss and also have learned quite a bit from the experience. As to why the chimney leaks so much ,  I think what I need to also do is seal the edges around the outside of bricks where they go into the roof of  house and down into the house. I have placed a piece of metal on top of the chimney but in what of the last rainstorms I did notice water leaking. It was not a lot of water but also the storm was not as intense as the storm that caused the damage. I recall the night of the storm that it rained extremely hard all night long. I had my computer sitting directly underneath where the chimney comes down into the house as it only comes down 4-5 feet from the ceiling as this was the former kitchen as this was where the cook stove pipe was vented.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGMGFHKJ,,0.0

Over the past 7 months, I have made huge advances in all areas of my life. Most importantly, my mental health has drastically improved. Due to a lifetime of abuse, neglect, prison, drug use and be made to feel less than, I had become a person with two identities. In this way, I rationalized my drinking, drug use and destructive behavior because I felt I needed to feed that ""bad"" person in my life and the only way to do that was to get loaded. This was the addict brain deceiving me, in fact, over the last 7 months I have been able to merge these parts of my identity,  harness motivation from within to overcome many things in my life. About 3 months ago, I heard a pod cast from a person who has been clean for several years and he said that never in a million years could he have imagined his life as it was being 2 years clean. I really needed to hear this to continue to motivate myself to not use but instead to devote all of that time I have spent, manipulating, hustling, lying, cheating, and stealing to do productive things. There is no reason I cannot be successful. For example over the last two months, I have completed two graduate courses at one of the top tier universities. I have been given a career advancing opportunity. I have mended relationships with my wife and kids, and I am comfortable with me. I can work alone and in the quiet because I am content with who I am. I feel connected to God on a spiritual level to help me make decisions that are well-discussed and thought out. My temperament has drastically improved. I have also begun to remove the clutter (both physical and metaphorical) from my life. I know that I am worthy. I know my past does not determine my future. I know I am not defined by the decisions and history of my parents. I know that i can do whatever I want as long as I work for it. I have making positive strides to be educated, balanced, and pensive in all of my affairs. This is how I have been contemplating my life over the a past few months. I have had small victories that have motivated me to keep going. For example, I bought a new flat screen tv and wall mount. s.",3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX20XU0X,,0.0

It was finally going to happen. After years of marriage, and kids, and bills, and stress, my spouse and I were finally going to be able to just take a week and do whatever we wanted. We hired the babysitter. We took the vacation time off of work. We made all the plans and deposits and everything we needed to have the most fun vacation of all time. And vacation we did. Our destination was cliche, but we went to California, and we went to the beach. Not just one beach, beaches all along the state. We even went as far as the border between California and Oregon. It was beautiful to see such a sight. Some of the beaches were dirty, unkempt, and even downright trashy. But most of the ones we went to were simply beautiful. We collected seashells, took millions of pictures, laid out in the sun, got ice cream, and just did all the fun things we've wanted to do for so many years.

I was really fear and getting very worry about my son.  Sometimes my son did not do any thing without the help of myself.    Nowadays it was really very hard thing to manage my son activities in home.  My wife works at home.  But she also do not know about how to tackle or manage my toddle son's non stopped activity.  Three months ago my toddler son broke his arm while I was not around on him.  My also doing some work in the house.  So she did not know how to make the first aid kid.  So she suddenly make a call for me and telling about the incident. I was really getting very sad about the incident of my small child  Because I love my son very much than everything in this world  So, that I am not able to tolerate this incident.   I was totally blanked and think of my child's pain while going to the home.  My colleagues are very support and make myself calm and help me taking my child in the hospital   After the injury of my child I often took permission or leave.  But the manager of my office may understand my situation.  because he is also a father of his child. And also I spent more time for my toddle kid making himself very enthusiastic and enjoyable.Nowadays I was really very like to spent more time between my son and also my wife.  Which decision made myself very happy and energetic to do my works properly in my office and also in my house so I just giving the best advice to all married couples is being very good to your child and family which makes you very happy and made your life fulfillment.  Nowadays my life is very beautiful only because of my lovable family. Unexpected event that changed my Life Sometimes things happen in the lives of people that they have no control over. When these things happen I call them life experience, and they often leave people muttering the words Why me From time to time, actions of others affect my own. Other times, an act of irresponsibility and immaturity on people’s part could cause life changing events on our loved ones and on us. From bad events, I have learned.  If you want to be happy you should spent more time with family members. always do more things for you family makes you happy and feel proud to yourself.  Families are an integral part of one’s life it does not matter if you have a small or big family as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H4CNTZG,0.0

We had been talking about it for a while, and the timing finally seemed right. We couldn't afford a large wedding ceremony and reception and all of the expenses that go along with traditionally getting married in the United States, so we decided to elope at home. We planned a short, private ""ceremony"" in our living room to be held the following week, and we invited only our close and direct family members to attend. In that week, I bought a casual $100 white dress and a small faux bouquet of flowers for our ceremony. My boyfriend and I were nervous a bit that we were moving too fast or not thinking everything through, but we knew we wanted to be married and that pre-wedding jitters are normal. The night before we married, we went out for a special dinner just the two of us. We discussed our nerves but also our excitement, and we wrapped up our vows that we planned on saying to each other. The next morning, the strap on my dress broke and we told our families to come over an hour later than planned so I could fix it to wear for our marriage. I was stressed out and cried a bit, wondering if this was a mistake and that we should wait to have a ""proper"" engagement and wedding. However, I told myself that the wedding itself wasn't the important part, the marriage was, and I was positive I wanted to get married. I fixed my dress, our families arrived, and everything was wonderful. We played some music and read our vows, I got very emotional and cried, and so did our families. My husband's family surprised us with a beautiful cake and champagne, and we had a toast and cut the cake. We grabbed a broomstick from our basement and jumped over it since our wedding was actually more of an elopement. We took a ton of photos in our living room to remember the special day, and went out to dinner together as a new family. I'll always remember this special day that I got married even though it wasn't what I imagined it to be. It was low-key and casual, and it was very special to us even though it was not a traditional wedding.",,3ZOTGHDK5JX0MY70E0KK1Y1RG0BOS9,0.0

A man sat outside singing for the guests who visited the restaraunt. He strummed his guitar and the mood was light and summery. Even more luck since there was a pokistop right on the playground.

Not financially (we are on their phone plan and gas card) but by unfriending us on social media, not coming to my ballet performance and not speaking to us.  I was more hurt by that than Ashley, because they have always come to my shows and there wasn't any reason for them not to, except to punish her.  Or her through me.  They actually moved to another city 2-3 hours away because of this as well.  The mother is very passive-aggressive and also has a history of overreacting to things.  When my partner was just out of high school and this came up, she drove into a wall and started to break down.  They also mentioned that she was embarrassing them because their friends had heard about it.  Things have gotten slightly better since then.  Her mother has re-friended me on social media and is speaking to us and has said moving was a big mistake.  But the subject of Ash being transgender is something they just don't talk about.  This has really hurt my partner a lot, but she's actually handling it pretty well.  She basically thinks if they don't want to talk about it or acknowledge it, then that's fine and they can just have a distant relationship.  And I agree.

I wanted to watch some Netflix. A text popped up from a number I didn't recognize. I read it and it was from a woman who was confessing her love to my husband. There was nothing to imply he had been having an affair, though. It was just her confessing to him. I confronted him about it. He said its a coworker who has liked him for the past year or so. He  said it was nothing to worry about and that she is just kind of obsessed with him. I asked if they have ever hung out together, and he said no. He assured me he has no interest in her at all and to not get worked up. I believed him, but I am honestly a little paranoid. I have been spying on him since then.

I felt like my world was coming to an end. I was so confused about how to treat the situation. I consulted a close friend seeking advice about what to do. Should I confront my husband? Or should I play along in order to learn more about this strange woman? My friend Sarah advised I confronted my husband to ensure I don't act on assumptions. I acted on the advice and confronted my husband who played down the issue, insisting the strange woman in question was just an admirer. he assured me nothing was ongoing between them and promised he would never cheat on me. But there is a part of me who thought my husband is not being honest. I'm scared right now because I think my marriage is hanging on a balance. I have since sought advice from friends and family about steps I need to take to prevent my marriage from crumbling to the ground. Should I hire a private investigator in a bid to learn more about this strange woman? Or should I trust my husband and allow the issue slip?

Taking advantage of less heat, my unruly neighbor decided to take up her woodworking activity on her apartment balcony again. Her balcony is situated next to my room desk and across from my front door where I work on my laptop. She moved in next door while still employed by the property. She began causing a ruckus by cursing, at her incredibly hyperactive child as well as her older stepchildren, as she banged, hammered, etc for months on end. It was taken in stride under the impression that she was working on remodeling the apartment in lieu of the usual maintenance crew. She eventually stopped when the summer heat became unbearable but still let her child screech, scream and climb all over the place while she looked at her phone in the evenings. She'd yell at him every 20 seconds or so instead of paying attention to him or taking him to the park across the street. When walking past her, she would ignore anyone coming across her. The noise was intolerable as she started up again. This time, she used heavy machinery from early morning into the evening. Her kid would just screech at the top of his lungs next to her. I started recording her extraordinary noise in audio files and video . I also began taking images of her woodpile, hidden from public view, but clearly visible from my front door. I messaged the property manager about her proximity and balcony violations but got no response. I called the front desk and they said the manager wasn't in. They said they couldn't do anything because they didn't have authority. Following day, same attempts and replies but nothing... third day, trying to get management to stop her, nothing. Eventually while she worked all day again, some other neighbor confronted her and she stopped... until he left, then started again. I called the corporate office overseeing  more than just this complex. No answer. Saturday rolled around, nothing, she was still at it ALL day. After some initial prejudice and trying to back me off, I quoted city ordinance statutes to the police and they came by to stop her. She lied and said she was unaware the noise was bothersome.",,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQEYWDHA,0.0

Heart disease and heart issues run in the family, sadly it runs on both sides. I have always been very proactive with taking medicines and doing what the doctor had told me. I never really understood why they never told me that losing weight would help more, but I guess since my family is all overweight that they just assumed we didn't care about our bodies. When I had to switch doctors, one of the first things she asked was if I was ever looking to get off the medication. I told her that I would love to be off the medication, but no one had ever given me that option. She explained to me that my weight being what it was was a huge reason why I had high blood pressure. She went into all the science of it and even told me that if this conversation got to be too much, she would stop and not press the issue. I told her I was fine with the topic. She went on to tell me that losing weight could get me off all the medication and would decrease a lot of the issues that I had. I felt blindsided! Not for what she was saying, but because no doctor before her ever even asked me about this! Soon after that, I started counting calories and going for afternoon walks more. I watched what I ate and watched what I did. I lost some weight and really started to feel better about myself and my whole situation! Thankfully, 5 months ago I was taken off all medication to see how I feel about it. I felt so great! I loved not being tied down to having medication!",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2ND0T9E1,0.0

The bus ride to Barre was so long that it seemed I really was headed into Canada, if not the Arctic Circle. There were no interstate highways in Vermont at that time. We motored up Route 14 along the White River Valley out of White River Junction. Finally we got to Barre, and I was picked up at the bus stop by my assigned farmer, Louis Carrier, and taken to his dairy farm on a hill in Williamstown. I was thrilled that he was going to keep me on. I had no money for a bus ticket home. I spent most of my first month’s pay on maple syrup purchased at a general store and mailed home. Why was it so expensive? I wanted to show my family that I was going to be the kind of working man who shared his wealthI made certain I did everything right, but went light on feeding the calves to allow me enough time to sneak in the house and scoop out some ice cream before the family got home. Louis inspected the barn — but not the freezer, thankfully — and was duly impressed. I experienced his first words of praise and I basked in them.",,3ZPPDN2SLWIW5SYCBGHXFR2NLX0E9F,0.0

She was a lovely woman and everyone who knew her, even people outside our family absolutely loved her. She was, however, very secretive about her health and didn't want everyone to be concerned about her dying. When she did pass, it was a big deal for our family. We had spent almost every holiday at her house, eating delicious foods at her table. She always went all out when it came to the family, and everyone always go the best she could offer. My family was really upset that I didn't go to the funeral. At the time I was only a teenager and had never attended a funeral. I was grieving but also really terrified to see her in that way. I was scared that that would be the last time I saw her. I thought about all the times that we had shared together and it was overwhelming and unbearable for me. My family just could not find the sympathy to understand how I felt and acted as though I didn't care about her passing, when that was the furthest from the truth. The only person who really understood was my father. He really got how frightening it could be for a child to have to see their grandmother's body before they put her in the ground. He told me not to worry about the rest of my family's opinion and that it would eventually blow over. I still am really thankful for him understanding how I felt.",,3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3VGO049,0.0

I know that sounds bad but I like nearly a thousand miles away, and to be honest, I just can't be bothered going back to where I grew up more than once a year or so. I grew up in Northwest PA in a tiny remote town, and I never really fit it. I like computers, engineering, and technology, and my hometown relies on oil and logging. I live near Boston now, and its great. Stores are open past 8pm, there's variety, shops, resturatants, etc. Its no wonder I don't like to go back there. I'm also not a sentimental person and I'm not particularly attached to my family. They're fine for the most part, but that's about it. Just...fine. I know it was just random chance that I was born into that family. I'm not close with them and I'm fine with that. So yeah, its not a huge surprise that I didn't go back for my grandmothers funeral. I actually grew up in the same town she lived in, until I was in second grade, but all I really remember is how much that side of the family fought with each other. Its like they thought they had to stick together because they're family, but they also didn't like or get along with each other. I guess I just learned from an early age that just because you're related to someone doesn't mean you have to be close to them.",3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3VGO049,,0.0

Not everyone changes, or wants to, or can. However, my story was about realizing that in my relationship when I wanted to think none of it was my fault I realized that some of it is, and that you really have to be committed to view the other person's perspective. It doesn't mean you have to agree, but you should always be learning. The most surprising thing was when I learned that my SO felt a certain way that I would have never thought of, and suddenly a lot became clear. I always thought of myself as pretty emotionally intelligent, but when I learned I was wrong it really opened some doors to more thinking. The only thing this really means to me is again, it's important to keep learning and keep having and open mind and keep trying to better yourself. It doesn't mean things will work out. It doesn't mean everything will be OK. But it will probably be better for the person trying to grow, even if you end up broken-hearted in the end. There's not much you can do about that. In conclusion, that relationship didn't end out with us together forever. Now I can take what I learned and bring it into another relationship. I can only hope to keep in mind everything I learned.

That happened several months ago, probably close to six or seven months have gone by now. I have not really thought about the writing exercise since I completed the survey. Since we've gone through the end of summer and fall is in full-swing here in my neck of the woods, I've been seeing more and more wildlife hanging around. There have been a lot of deer, especially. Of course, seeing a doe run out in front of one's car is a much more common experience for most people. I have thought about the bear, though, anytime that I've slammed on the brakes to avoid hitting the deer. I thought that maybe Animal Control had been called and the bear had been moved out of the area... until recently. I have an update to share: the bear (or what I believe to be the same bear) actually showed up in our neighborhood again! It happened not too long ago - within the last month, maybe month and a half. He/she was traipsing through the back lots behind several houses on our road. This time, the sighting didn't happen on a trash collection day (the two previous times that I saw the bear, garbage had been set out on the curb for pick up). Another key difference was that it was walking through during the evening instead of the morning hours. Several other people also saw the bear, according to neighborhood gossip. It hasn't run out in front of my car again, though (and for that I am grateful!).",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDPM3SFL,,0.0

We've been dating for over 2 years but somethings have not been adding up recently and i feel there is a need for us to go our separate ways. This decision was mutual and would be mutually benefiting. I know it's going to be hard to get over it but i know i'll survive.  I have for about 6 months now noticed a sudden change of behavior, everything we shared and enjoyed together all of a sudden doesn't make sense to her anymore. She now complains about almost everything, on days when i call regularly she complains of me disturbing her. On days when i'm too busy to call however she says i'm not been caring enough. I later found out she was seeing another person who happened to be someone i knew and they were both trying to hide the relationship from me. It was had pill to swallow but life most go on. What i'm still trying to wrap my head around is why she didn't just break up instead of the torments she was putting me through. She basically sits around all day doing nothing, she resigned from work about 5 months ago and i've been responsible for most of the stuffs we both need and i still get cheated and insulted, i don't know what i've done to deserve this but i know their sweeter things laying in future for me. I don't know how long this would take to heal but i know it will someday. I am seriously not considering dating anyone in the nearest future. I'm presently trying to enroll at a near by culinary school, I have had to stop myself from doing so many things, just so I'll have enough time to be with her. Now i want to start chasing all those dreams i had halted for love. I wish i hadn't started the relationship in the first place.",,3ZSY5X72NYXOLJ7NZBKFBOWVMR7ORE,0.0

We hired an air conditioner contractor. This was after much research as well as numerous quotes and checking out many companies. The amount for a new heat/air unit was something we had to take a loan out for. We wanted to get it right because it is a large expense. We chose the company, they came out and we went through our options of different units and chose the best one for our 1,600 sq ft house. We even chose to pay a little more for a brand we trusted. The workers tore out the old unit and put in the new. He did not put in a new thermostat as he forgot to bring the digital one we ordered, he came back 2 days later and asked how the unit was doing, I explained it was very loud and sounded like tennis shoes in a dryer, He checked out the system, made numerous adjustments but could not get the sound to go away. He was confused and asked that I allow him to go and research and call the manufacturer to get ideas on what the problems was. He came back the next day with what we thought was a solution but it still didnt work. In all of his confusion he requested a few more days assuring me it would be taken care of. Another couple of days passes and he comes back with yet another solution from the manufacturer. This again did not work.He then wanted his money but of course, he wasent going to pay him when my brand new air unit sounded like an old dryer. He said because of all of the trouble he would take 10% off of the cost. We agreed and he discounted the price by about $600. He also promised in writing he would take care of the problem or install a brand new unit.A week later he shows up with yet another solution that this time cut the noise down by 75%, we were happy with that and the discount. I paid his worker an additional $150 for other trunkline work done that was not included in the total price. He then said he needed to collect the rest of the money for the air conditioner?? we were shocked what?? you were paid in full. He proceeds to tell us that was a discount just until he got it fixed? What really? I never heard of someone especially a business giving a temporary discount and this was never discussed. He proceeded to become angry that we were not giving the discount back and threatened to sue us for the $600.",3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61QT9W3C,,0.0

My son had been acting wild all day while I had been dealing with trying to get work done. It was frustrating attempting to get him to calm down enough to actually go to bed. He put up a small argument when I told him finally that it was bed time. However, after a couple of minutes, he conceded to bedtime. He laid down on the bed and I put his blanket on him. He then got very quiet and asked me a question.""Dad, am I good?"" I couldn't help but answer, ""Most of the time. I really wish you would act better, though."" It was then he hit me with one of the more profound things I've ever heard. ""Daddy, I have to be bad so I can be good in the future. "" I asked him, ""Why is that?"" ""Because, Daddy. If you don't have a past, you can't ever have a future."" As much as I wanted to debate him and show him how he was technically wrong, that at any point he wanted he could decide to be good, I couldn't help but be amazed at the fact that he was right. My son just laid there, looking confident in what he was saying. Ever since he said it, I've been completely unable to shake it from my mind.

And we're living our best life.",,3ZWFC4W1UVTUF6UU081POUNH13QFRQ,0.0

I woke up early that day, around 5am. The weather was unseasonably warm as I stepped outside to head to the gym to get a swim in. Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair. He has his father's eyes, and my button nose. The nurses all said he was the most handsome baby they had ever seen. After nine months of waiting, I couldn't believe that it only took five hours for my son to arrive. We stayed overnight at the hospital so that his health could be monitored. A breast feeding specialist came in to make sure Cameron was latching that morning. After that, we were able to head home with our new son.",,3ZWFC4W1UVTUF6UU081POUNHDM7FRL,0.0

It was a regular day and everyone seemed to be doing well , and we were having a fun time. I was doing a route, and there was a certain section that I couldn't get past, so my buddy decided to give it a shot. He is one of the better climbers in our group, so we didn't think it would be too hard for him. He started up confidently, and was climbing with ease. Out of the blue he lost grip with one of his hands. This rarely happened to him, and as we were watching it felt like slow motion. He fell about 20 feet off the rock face and hit the ground. We heard a loud crack when he hit the ground , and knew instantly what happened. He broke his leg. We all rushed to his aid, and tried to support the broken leg as best we could. We had no choice but to help him down the hill which was quite a distance. We ended up making it back to the car, and we drove him to the hospital. We were all very worried about him, but the doctor assured us he would be fine. We have all been very careful since that day.",3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,,0.0

There wasn't a lot of parking where we were going, so the fewer cars the better.  Once we got there we saw a few of our other friends and hiked to the rock with them. It was enormous and towering over us. I made the first climb because I was familiar with the climb. It felt good, but the rock was a bit slippery from the rain the night before. Our other friend went next. He was about halfway up and lost his grip. He fell about 20 ft and missed the pads we had laid out for protection. We heard a snap and knew that his leg broke. We made a splint for his leg and all worked together to carry him out. It felt like it took hours, but was only maybe 15 minutes. We got him back to the car and drove to the hospital. They set his leg and put a cast on him. He wasn't allowed to climb for quite some time, but overall he was okay.",3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,0.0

My wife hit me and got violent which involved the police arriving at the scene. Since I was in the Army, the Army separated us and I ended up getting very suicidal, which led to me to commit suicide. I was hospitalized and was put on suicide watch for 5 months and had to live in a conference room that the Army provided me. When I was discharged from the Army in June, I was involved in another domestic incident where my wife stabbed me. She was arrested and there was a protection order put in place.  She was released from jail when her mom bonded her out.  While all this happened, I was in the middle of finding a new home. I struggled finding a new home due to the lack of funds, and my bad credit score. I eventually managed to find a cheap home and my mom helped me cosign. I registered for school and had trouble with transportation due to my wife taking the car. My only source of income at the time was Mturk and I used it for Uber. I was fortunate to have met a Veteran that understood my situation and offered to give me rides to school. The next court date regarding my wife is not until October. I don't know what is to come but I hope that I will be financially and mentally ready for what's to come.",,,0.0

I was at a basketball game it was the championship game the crowd was packed everything was perfect the game was close the whole time all the way until the last play. I had the ball in my hands and I was ready to win the game. I went to the basket for the game winner and missed I was devastated. My team lost I was crying and it made me very emotional because I felt like I let everyone down. After the game we had the award ceremony the worst part I think was standing up trying to smile while receiving runner up trophies. It was the best season that we had and it all came down to one play and I couldn't get it done. It was a lot of emotions going around because my family had came to watch the game and I wanted to put on a show. This event is very significant to me because it showed me how to lose. Winning is probably one of the best feelings in the world but you learn more from a loss. That's why I chose to talk about this story and not any other. This writing task was challenging, and fun in any ways. It made me think while also reminiscing it was a very interesting task. It brought up feelings of regret, anguish, and lastly relief. Mainly because I know that moment is over and it helped shape who I am today I don't have to take it as a failure. This task overall was very fun and interactive as a whole.

Once the eating finished and we opened the dance floor, I wandered around to talk to everyone to make sure they were having a good time. I remember watching my brother and my mom dancing, and then his wife and her dad dancing, and finally the newly weds. I made sure to stay close by to my older brother, because he isn't married yet and I knew he felt lonely. I also grabbed some cake balls, because yum. When the actual dancing started — like, with everyone — I joined the people on the floor and had a blast. I'm not the best dancer, but I can follow along and can keep rhythm. I remember seeing my brother and how happy he was, and how pretty his bride looked. Even once the dancing started, though, I remember that i was a host and tried to keep an eye on people. I noticed one person in particular who looked lonely, and normally she really likes dancing. Not wanting the day to go badly for her, I left the dance floor and went to talk to her. I discovered she was sad because her own husband couldn't make it, so I said I would dance with her. That made her really happy, and she went back out on to the floor. Once I was satisfied she was okay, I found a couple other people to partner up and dance. I remember feeling so content and like I was serving an important purpose. I'm not normally very extroverted, but I felt like it was my responsibility, you know? We ended the night by having all the groomsmen grabbing my brother and hoisting him over their heads, then throwing him up in the air to crowd surf. He was a little terrified, but he also had fun, so it was an absolute win. I'm so glad everyone had a good time.",,,0.0

As it is usually just my son and I home we have things down to a 't' when it comes to our schedule but his grandma was home which messed things up a bit. Not only for him but for me too. She's a lot harder to entertain versus a 10 month old. But I had let her take him in with her and she was making her bed. This bed is a good 4 feet off the ground mind you. She decided to put him on top of it and when she was on the other side my poor baby had fallen off. So of course I rush in with my heart beating out of my chest because he was crying so bad. She was trying to explain but I didn't want to hear none of it, I just wanted my baby to be okay. I eventually got him calm and he went to sleep but when he woke and started back in on crying again I knew something wasn't right. I was so angry at her for hurting him though she didn't intentionally hurt him. I still blamed her because I thought how could you not be more careful? You know your bed is a mountain compared to this baby, you know he moves fast! How, how, how did you not think that this would have happened before it did. So we took him to the doctors and this poor little 10 month old is already in to get x-rays. I was devastated, embarrassed and so, so sorry for my little guy. Turns out he got a small fracture to the wrist. So they put a cast on him for 3 weeks and they said the bone will be stronger than it was before since he is so young. It was reassuring but it sure didn't make me feel any better about the situation. Yeah, last week sucked.",,,0.0

We loaned them some money to help them start a business in the t-shirt printing industry.  Over the years they worked hard to increase sales and their reputation.  They paid us back in full in May 19.  One evening we were sitting on lawn chairs on the driveway; enjoying some adult beverages.  I pulled out some paperwork from a folder.  My friends asked ""What is all that paperwork you have.""  I explained that it was the spreadsheet I made to track their payments to us over the years.  My friend likes to smoke cigars, so I told him to use his torch.  He looked quizzically at me but complied with my request and lit the paperwork.  We ceremoniously burned the loan paperwork and dubbed it the burning of the business mortgage.  We all had a good laugh about the event for two reasons.  We were all happy that the mortgage was paid off and the excellent single malt whiskey we were drinking.  Word of caution: Don't drink and dri...burn mortgages at the same time.

At the time I didn't know they were going to play because I did not thoroughly read about the event prior. They were the last to play onstage. After they had played a few sets it was time for their last song. Before the last song started one of my managers  told me that the lead singer was going to walk by the upper stadium were I was at during the start of the song. This was exciting for me and I almost could not breathe because I really loved the lead singer and was very fond of him. Just as stated before he did walk by were I was as he song the last song. I was so close to him that I patted him on his side to get his attention. He didn't hear or see me because it was so loud in their and security guards were pushing people away from him.

She checked herself into the hospital with stomach pains and while under observation she developed a brain bleed which killed her. She was 65. When I try to remember the day it happened, when my brothers and I went to the hospital, it feels like I'm remembering a dream. I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life. I imagine the closer you are to the person who dies the more off balance your life becomes.",,,0.0

Since the beginning of 2014 I started to have some insane abdominal pain. My family and I had probably went to hospital over 30 times that fall. I remember vividly getting my diagnosis & just breaking down. I was diagnosed with not only Crohn's Disease, but also Ulcerative Colitis. From January of 2015 to now, I'm still suffering. 27 feet of intestines removed and over 20 surgeries later. Not to mention during this 13 hour surgery my lungs failed. I was put into ICU on a breathing machine. The impact this made on my life was dramatic. From having my intestines hanging out of my stomach. To feeling the absolute worst pain you can imagine and waking up not knowing whats going on. Overall it was a tough time, but I learned a lot! Looking back it was definitely something I could never forget. Most important it made me into the man I am today. Tomorrow is never promised and you just have to have faith.",,,0.0

It was pretty funny actually, they like expected me to be sad or something. The HR guy was on the line through a remote location. They basically just sat me down and said I didn't clean the hood. I told them that yes I did, and told them they should look to whatever day I cleaned the bins. Then I asked when they were asking people if I cleaned if they asked my other coworker. They said they had not. When I asked to review the tapes myself, the tapes didn't exist anymore. Like seriously how sketchy is that lol. I was so mad just about that really. Also they noted the hood was dirty 22 days after I supposedly cleaned it. They addressed it to me almost 45 days after I cleaned it. And by the time they were firing me over it, the tape didn't exist. what a bunch of malarkey, really.",,,0.0

I live in Lake Havasu City, desert, but with a lake.  My husband and I really aren't into the whole lake scene as far as it's a ""party town"",  but being able to take walks by it and such are very enjoyable.  Recently my kids came to visit for 3 days and we rented a boat for one day, but what was more enjoyable was the third day we drove to the Grand Canyon.  I had only seen it as a small child, 6 years old.  My husband had grown up not far from there.  My kids had never seen it.  Since I hadn't seen my kids in years, even the time driving there was enjoyable because we could ""catch up"" as well as the fact that they had never met my husband.  Once we got there we picked the tour that we felt my husband could best handle since he is visually impaired.  My kids were very patient  at not getting too far ahead of us and such.  We had a fantastic day.  We will never forget seeing a cliff with a small plateau and this mountain goat was just standing on the plateau.  Pretty amazing how it got there.  On way back we talked about times in our life when we had ""mountains in life"" to climb and how we got to the top.  Overall, just an experience that I hope to have again.",,,0.0

These were the last words he said to me…. You know what that “tomorrow” never came. X ( I am hiding the name ) was a good friend of mine. I first saw him in when I was in sixth standard. I guess he was a new admission in the school. He was very silent by nature. As I am a very talkative person so I always tried to persuade him to speak something. But he never changed his habit. Well that was too much annoying for me. Sorry, but I hate those people who always keep silent and don't express themselves. when he started to talk to me without my persuasion. He wasn't a brilliant guy so he often scored average in the exams. His desire to learn more brought him closer to me ( actually I was the topper of my class at that time. ) we became good friends there after. I was in eleventh standard when everything changed suddenly. I remembered that day he was very happy. He was talking to everyone and passing smiles to everyone in reply of a hello or hi. He was acting quite amusing that day. I didn't asked him the reason but I was happy to know he was enjoying his surroundings. Next day when I reached the school, I found that the environment of the class was quite disturbing. Almost everybody was standing in his own respective friend circle and was whispering. I sensed that something terrible has happened. When I enquired about the topic I was told that four of our school students who were coming to school on a motorcycle early in the morning have been brutally crushed by a truck.

I was quite surprised myself. When I sing I take the song into myself and make it a part of me. When I was done singing there were people in the audience who openly wept. My teacher was crying and I found I was crying myself. It took me awhile to regain my composure, but when I did I was in the middle of a standing ovation. I sang many more song that day, but the memory of my first one will always be the best. This will always be my best memory because of the joy I felt at not only being the center of attention but the star of the show.

About 3 months ago, he had to stay in the hospital for 48 hours to be continually monitored. This had to be done due to concerns from his teachers. They were saying he seemed to be drifting off at random times and not responding. Because of them reporting this issue, we made an appointment with his neurologist. She stated that the only way to see if he was still having seizure activity was to monitor him for 2 days in the PICU. So we set a date and time and waited patiently for it to come around. The day of the test, we arrived very early. They showed us to his room and within an hour the tech was there to begin the process. As they attached the multiple amounts of electrodes to my young child's head, I began to get very emotional and I'm not sure why. It's hard to see your child has an issue. You feel like you may have done something wrong at some point to cause it. All of my family came to visit my son while he was in the hospital and it was very heartwarming that everyone came together to be there for him. The best part about the whole situation was that the test showed no new seizure activity. This means that hopefully he will grow out of his condition over the next few years and can completely wean off of seizure medication and enjoy a normal teenage and adult life.",,,0.0

My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be. It was a rough couple of weeks but I'm glad we could get justice for Eric.",,,0.0

It was a special event for me as I haven't seen them in about 10 years. For the exception of my mother and my younger brother all of my relatives live in Cuba. I had been planning and was very interested in going to see my family for many years, but was unable to because of lack of money mostly because for most of those years I was underage and wasn't able to raise enough money. After raising enough money for my visa and the plane ticket along with all other necessary expenses I would be having on this trip I decided it was time to finally go on this long awaited trip. I booked my flight, told my younger brother about the trip but decided not to tell anyone else as I wanted to surprise them. On the day of the flight I took an Uber to the airport as the only person that new was my underage brother and therefore I had no one that could of drove me there. In the airport things were pretty simple I just checked in and since I just have a small luggage I didn't have to make any long lines in order to check in additional bags. The flight went smoothly as well and about an hour I was in the capital of Cuba. Once I got there I immediately went to the arrival line where a lady asked me some questions and after a short interview I was able to get my bag and check out. Once I walk out the airport doors It honestly felt like I was transported 50 years back. All the cars and structures seemed like they were all from the 70's or older for the exception of tourist rental cars and the occasional modern Kia like small car. Thankfully I was fluent in the language and remembered by previews trips to Cuba as a kid and was able to find a person that guided me to a place in the city where I could rent a car for my week long stay. I drove directly to where my family lived about 3 hours away from the capital with no directions as I remembered how to get there. Seen my family once again was an awesome experience and brought back many memories from my childhood trips. The week went by faster that expected but I was able to see my siblings in the island as well as the rest of my family from both my moms and dads side, as well as experienced a whole other culture. Undeniably, it was a very emotional trip and one I would love to experience again in the near future but next time I'll be taking my younger sibling so he can also experience it.",,,0.0

We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her. I approached it like how my counselor told me to, and she said I have to realize that it may not go the way it is intended to, and she was right, and that is why it hurt all the more.",,,0.0

I got my husband back from a long deployment. This event was so memorable because of our son and how excited he was. It was also very emotional because we had been apart for so long. I felt like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and I had my family back together. The feelings I felt that whole day up until seeing him is just something I could never forget. He was supposed to come home a few days before but it got changed and it was so frustrating. His new time was going to be two in the morning and I remember being so exhausted. I woke my son up literally as I was walking out the door. He was such a trooper, while we waited for daddy he played with a little American flag and just crawled around. The second we seen him I started crying, and my son could not stop starring at him. I was so nervous about how our son was going to react to him. He was so young when he left and now almost a year old and had established fears. He was very nervous around men since he was not around many with his father being gone. But he went to his daddy like he knew exactly who he was and nothing made me happier than that moment.  We have been through deployments before but this was our first one with a child. This was a whole different experience that you could only understand if you have been through it. I am so thankful for my husband and everything he does for our family. Often when I think about him being gone and when he comes home I just think about myself and how I struggled and how I felt. I forget to think about him and how he is struggling. Seeing his face when he picked up our son just put me completely his shoes and made me realize how much he is sacrificing. He missed six months of his child's life, I could not imagine. This was for sure an evening I will never forget and always cherish.",,,0.0

It was 3 years on June 14th so we drove up into Cherokee, North Carolina from Georgia in order to go camping. We left in the morning and first went to the shops went we got into Cherokee and we got awesome new moccasin shoes that were fuzzy on the inside for our lazy few day trip. We drove into the campground after we ate a burger in town for dinner. Pitching the tent was really fun, because my two dogs were attacking the poles as we were trying to set it up; my girlfriend was laughing and smiling cheek to cheek. We got the tent pitched and decided to get the fire started before we brought our supplies into the tent, so I went up to the main office to buy some kindle and firewood. I built a massive fire with the help of my girlfriend and she took all the credit to herself as per usual. She's always proud of herself for funny things like that. We brought a plastic chest full of snacks and supplies so we would definitely not go hungry. Usually couples go out to dinner and date, but we ate out of cans for 3 days! I think this is definitely a main reason why I lover her. We don't have to be like every other couple. We're unique. When we were done there; we didn't want to leave. Neither did the dogs! We watched all of our movies we had downloaded on our computers and drained our powerbank so we couldn't charge our phones, so being a 21st century couple, we went back to civilization! I had a blast and I know we will never forget our awesome time.",,,0.0

It was something that really opened my eyes to what my health and in turn my life could be like. This story is about a revelation of sorts that Living healthy and happy is something that I can achieve. One of the key moments in this story was when I met my all time fitness idol, ""the mountain"". It was a glorious day as I started getting in to strength training and fitness a couple of years ago when I went through a deep depression. This was a very significant event for me because fitness and strength training specifically changed my life. When I met my idol I was awestruck at how big he was but like me, he started somewhere. He told me consistency is key and even when you desperately want to give up, you have to push even harder and faster to break through it. His advice was so invaluable to me at the time because I had felt like giving up many times. I had him autograph a picture I had of him winning a strongman competition. This was such a great experience as It really motivated me to get better and stronger, which I did. I worked harder than ever after meeting him and realizing anyone can be strong with the work put in. I have realized that with almost everything in life, consistency is the most important thing which is what the experience taught me. I now try to be consistent in everything I do and it has paid off big time in the long run. I have been successful in all areas of my life so far by doing this.",,,0.0

I was in the car with him and I was driving and this black male came running at my car on the passenger side with a gun at a stoplight. The windows were down and he stuck the gun in the car and told us to get out. My boyfriend Hunter said no and he stuck the gun in his face so he grabbed it and pulled down and got shot in the foot. I know this didn't happen exactly to me, but it has made a huge impact in my life. I have PTSD and I don't even feel comfortable being in the car that it happened in. My ears ring to this day and every loud noise freaks me out. I am still continuing to figure out parenting on my own while he's recovering. I never got to mentally heal or physically heal since it happened two weeks after I gave birth. Not having my boyfriend at home was really tough because I had to do all the feedings all the diaper changes, figure out a schedule and do all these things on my own while he was at the hospital. Now that he's home, my source of income is mTurk and it's stressful trying to do everything I can and still not make enough money to support a family of three. My boyfriend can't pick up my son without being in pain and it hurts me to see. Every time I close my eyes I can see the look on his face when the bullet hit him. The bullet was a hollow point and destroyed his foot. I suddenly had to become a nurse and get taught how to give him injections for the pain medication and learn how to change out his IV bag at home and change the dressings on his foot until it closed up. Being a young mother and now becoming a caregiver as well drains me. I am very depressed, very anxious, and losing hope. I don't sleep because I'm terrified that my boyfriend will stop breathing because he's in so much pain. And on top of that, being paranoid about my newborn son stop breathing in his sleep.",,,0.0

The reason, I needed to purchase equipment and a new computer so I can self-teach myself animation and improve on my drawing/sketching ability.  Unfortunately, I did not have the funds to pursue my goals. I had to do something but I was not going to force anything that cost me money or put me debt.  I was bit sad about the situation because like some things in life, people want immediately results.  I needed to be patient, something I have always had an issue with.  However, I was not going to force the issue this time as I had mentioned before. One night out of the blue, a friend and had not hung with for a while wanted to meet up and chat with me about things going in his life and things going on in my life.  My friend picked me up on a Saturday afternoon and we just decided to drive around and talk about life. Because we became hungry after a while, we decided to head to the local casino and eat at the buffet.  You just cannot beat all-you-can-eat for a good price.   Also, I had not been to the casino in years because the last time I went, I cost myself over $100 and vowed not to go again.  However, my friend wanted to go and I did not want to stop him.  After we ate, we decided to sit down and play a couple of slot machine to waste time and test our luck.  As luck would have, I ended up winning about 400 bucks off of just $20 I spent.  My friend did not know I was down to my last 50 before going to the casino, so this money came in hand in a big way.  Now, I am not a religious guy but I will admit I looked up and said thank you to whoever the big man or woman is in the sky.  That money was more than what I needed to get the equipment I needed to purchases as well as purchase a low-cost, online animation course that set me on my way.  I was even able to give my friend $50 just for the hell of it. You just never know when you will be blessed with positive things.  I was so happy that I couldn't contain myself and almost started to cry but held together and just kept a joyful laughter for about a 5 minutes.",,,0.0

This actually just happened 2 days ago. I am a senior in college majoring in nursing, and have worked hard the past 3 years to do well in my classes and get good grades. As a result, I have a high GPA (3.9) and so I was eligible to join the Honor Society. It started with an email sent to me inviting me to join. Once I decided to join, I signed up online and paid the fee. What was extra special was that my parents offered to pay the fee for me because they knew it was important for me to join and they wanted me to be recognized for all my hard work. Then, this past Monday was the induction ceremony. I was a little disappointed because my parents were unable to attend, but two of my friends came instead. I dressed up in a nice dress, picked up my friends, and we went to the ceremony. There was a speaker who presented her research project, and then it was time for the induction. One of my professors read off all of our names (only 7 people in my class were invited to join), and we all went up individually to sign our names in the booklet, receive a certificate, and receive purple cords that we will wear at graduation. Afterwards we took pictures and ate cake. It was a really special night and it was nice to be recognized for my hard work. I appreciated my friends coming to support me. I am proud of myself for this accomplishment and for almost making it through nursing school.",,,0.0

I had been a stay at home mother for seven years and earned my college degree while doing so. My last child was entering kindergarten and I knew I would have more free time. I got lucky and was offered an amazing job at my children's school. I prepared myself mentally to adapt to this significant change in my life and I was looking forward to earning an income again (and not just relying on my husband to be the financial provider) and being around other adults regularly. The first week of work was training. It was intense; much more intense than I realized it would be. I felt so out of place and my anxiety was at an all time high. By the last day of training, I was an emotional mess; I felt inadequate, under prepared, and completely out my element. I remember going home and having an anxiety attack which made me feel like I was dying. I was so upset, nervous, and sick that all I could think about was failing. It should be noted, that I am generally a very positive and confident person. I graduated top of my college class with a 4.0 GPA and received glowing recommendations. However, on that weekend, I felt like the lowest person in the world. My anxiety became so overwhelming, my husband was worried that this would do long term damage to my self worth. Monday morning at 6 am, I decided I couldn't do it. On the first day of school, I walked into the principle's office and quit. I felt like I let down everyone around me. It was awful. It was such an emotional day. After a few days of reflecting on everything that had happened, I decided I needed to get some help. I visited my doctor and got on a higher dose of anxiety medicine. Within a week, I was fine. and back to my old self. I decided to learn from this experience and work on my anxiety.",,,0.0

This was almost a month ago. We got to see Young The Giant and Fitz & The Tantrums.  They are two of my favorite bands, and I'd never got to see either of them live before. My friend managed to get tickets for the show from another friend of his who was not able to go. I was the first person he thought of to invite to the concert, which I thought was very nice and sweet of him. The show was amazing, and it a great bonding experience for me and my friend. I felt much closer to him afterwards. It was a very positive emotional experience for me, because I got to experience it with a close friend and because I'm very passionate about music. Both of the bands put on a stellar show. The concert was about 3 hours long all together and we went out to eat afterwards. Overall, it was a great night. I'm so glad that I was the person they thought to invite. I'm very grateful for the experience as well as having a great friend like that. It has really helped our friendship grow.",,,0.0

I took on a side job that lasted for over 3 nights. My side job included me planning and managing an exciting extra event  of the planned show. The event was organized to happen in different locations of the show area. In the locations there were settings made to surprise selected fans attending the show by deceiving them. One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.",,,0.0

Unfortunately she hasn't been able to care for her in the right way, due to mental health issues. This resulted  in my granddaughter's removal from my daughter's home. My granddaughter was placed in my temporary care for the past 12 months. I have tried over the last year to work on building a trusting relationship with my daughter and work with her to make sure she is seeing her daughter often. We have gone to family therapy and learned to communicate more effectively. There had been many times where this was painful to watch my daughter have emotions of loss and try to convince her that I had to look out for my granddaughter as well. As part of the court proposal they suggested I become guardian. My daughter was not willing to agree to this. This would mean there was a chance my granddaughter could be put into the foster system. We had court on May 7th the day before my 49th birthday.  I was sure my daughter would not agree to guardianship. When the lawyers went in front of the judge my daughter had agreed that she would allow me to have guardianship. This was emotional because I felt sad for my daughter that she knew she would not get her daughter back if had gone to trial. On the other hand I felt a great relief that my daughter trusts me enough that I will make sure she has as much time with her daughter to keep their relationship alive in the hopes that some day she will be able to have her back.",,,0.0
