It was a lovely wedding– very unlike any wedding I’ve yet been to, but a lot like the weddings in the movies (you know, like The Wedding Crashers… never understood why someone would *want* to go to a wedding they weren’t invited to).  The ceremony was short and simple, though there were a lot of attendants, complete with flower girl and ring-bearer.  The bride had both her father and step-father give her away, one on each arm.  The Lutheran minister was kind of a jolly middle-aged woman.  The gentlemen were almost all in army dress uniforms.  From my cousin’s face, you could not tell he was hit by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan just a few months ago.  He’s still not walking correctly and never may, but the damage seems to mainly be concentrated in one leg. The wedding was in a part of the country where folks are not as stiff as Midwesterners or as unstructured as Northern Californians.  I’ve been to Midwestern wedding receptions that tried to be like this reception, but the soul wasn’t there so they always ended up being kind of lame with folks congregated in the parking lot to talk away from the DJ.  People at this wedding line-danced (and not just to country music) and they enjoyed it.  My usually introverted uncle is apparently a dancing fiend and led the bride in some traditional dances.  This essay is plagiarized.  The food was great and full of local specialties (including something we heard about on the Splendid table from their road trip foodies).  And, important in my book for any wedding, they served appetizers between the wedding and reception. You may recall that the groom’s parents had said they refused to attend because he was not getting married by a priest.  Not only did they not show up, despite his being hit by a roadside bomb in service to our country, they did not allow any siblings to come.  The daughter whose college my parents and aunts are paying was threatened with being disowned when her mother found out she was planning to attend.  So she didn’t go.  Guests kept asking if I was a sister.  No, not a sister.",304SM51WA4QG34IRAVFYVE1SAOBSB3,,0.0,retold

My wife and I had been trying to conceive a child for sometime now.  But we hadn't had much success.  However, we found out in march that we were pregnant!  I can't begin to describe the excitement that I felt when I found out we were having a baby.  I was so happy to find this news out as was my family!  Then a couple months later we found out we were having a girl!!  At first I was scared because being a guy I knew I didn't know all the ins and outs of what a girl goes through.  The one thing I knew for sure was that there was nobody that would love this girl more than I do!  I can't wait for her to get here.  My wife and I decided on a name right away.  We came to the decision rather easily without much fuss.  It's a name that we have liked for some time now.  My mom is also very excited about it, because my nieces from my sister are getting older now.  So it'll be nice for her to have a baby to care for.

Since she had some extra money in her travel fund leftover from last year, she invited me to come along as well. I was not working at the time and she would be paying for everything besides food so I decided to go. I had not seen my niece in a long time and she is only 4 so at that age kids change a lot. My mother in law and I had some time before the others arrived so we went to Universal Studios. Harry Potter world was my favorite and I am really glad I got to see it. It was very crowded but luckily the weather was not too hot. We spent a lot of time at Magic Kingdom with my niece and it was really neat to see what things she got excited about. We got to see several shows. The live action Frozen show was really well done and only about 20 minutes long so it was perfect for small kids. My niece really liked the fireworks. I enjoyed a lot of the rides and all of the shows. The food at Disney World is just okay for the price but we did have some good meals and some ice cream. I am very grateful that I got to go on the trip to see family and have some fun. It was a lot of long days of walking and getting tired but overall we all had a great time.",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7B3H5WHT,,0.0,retold

She said she would pay for everything and basically all I had to do was show up. She was meeting her daughter and granddaughter there and had enough money that I could come too. I almost didn't go because Disney World is crowded and it can be hard to hang out with a four year but I had not seen that part of the family in awhile, my schedule was clear, and it had been 12 years since I had been to Disney World. So I decided to go. My favorite days were when it was just my mother in law and I and we went to Harry Potter at Universal. The theme park was so well done and the rides were really fun and the butter beer was really good. The main big ride I ended up going by myself because my mother in law didn't want to go. It was kind of scary but it was really fun and so well done with 3D effects and lighting. It was too crowded to go wand shopping but that is okay because my husband got me a wand previously when he was in Orlando for a work trip. We also had fun with my niece, she liked anything to do with Frozen. We had lots of good food, rode on some fun rides. I liked eating at the dinosaur theme restaurant. It was basically Rainforest Cafe but with dinosaurs. The hotel we stayed in was Little Mermaid theme so that was really cute. But it was kind of noisy and the buses were far away for our hotel. Overall it was a really fun trip and I am glad I went, but I would not be going back any time soon.

After so many years of hard work, sleepless nights, working over the weekends, working more than 40 hours per week, after my college degree and certifications that I took in school I got promoted at work! My Manager ask me if we can have a quick meeting today to discuss some personal projects about my development here at work, and at the beginning of the meeting everything went smoothly, we were talking about new projects that were coming up and how I was doing in my current role. Then he tells me, what do you think if I offer you a supervisory position of the department? I was in shock and my answer was of course yes, this is the opportunity that I was looking for since I start in this company, all the hard work finally pay off. Then he makes me sign a paper with my salary increase and the new title. At that moment I was shaking and feeling anxious because this is an important moment of my life, and that I know that I have the potential to do more here in the company. After I signed those papers I tell thank you to my boss for this amazing opportunity of advancement in my career and I will never let him down in my new position. He said congratulations you deserve it, and I want to see more awesome things here at work. Then I left his office and I immediately called my wife and tell her the notice of my promotion and she was so happy because it is a new chapter for our life, with our new baby and kid, more money for the family and a bright future here in the company. It is a very emotional moment for me and my family, that I will never forget. After that I called my dad and mom to tell them the notice of my promotion here at work, my mom was all happy and she was telling how smart I'm and to be thankful with God for every step that I do at my career here at work. In the other hand my dad was kind of surprised, but he told me to shot for the top, keep fighting for your dreams and keep fighting for your family, because at the end they are all depending in your salary/money for a place to live, pay rent, groceries, entertainment. But at the end I know that he was happy but he wants me to see like in a Director/Managerial position, he always tells me that I have a lot of potential and that I'm very smart in whatever I do. Then after talking with my dad and mom, I give the surprise to my mom and father in law, they were so happy and pride that I got that promotion, because they know how much did I suffer to get that promotion and they gave me their best wishes and blessing to my family and always to look forward of new opportunities wherever I go.",,30H4UDGLT34F936W931DEP7B965PMM,0.0,recalled

By the time I reached home my mother had been sent home to hospice care because she had a stroke during the night(nobody noticed) I stepped into a bad dream when I finally got to my childhood home. She was in a hospital bed, hooked up to oxygen and barely alert. Alert enough to know it was me, her oldest, her favorite everyone's always told. me. She even said my name and that she loved me.  I swear I spent five days awake, sitting in the rocking chair next to her bed, singing in her ear, saying prayers, talking to her, telling her dad was waiting for her. She died when I was holding her, just mom and I alone in her room,  my mouth pressed up against her good ear. I felt her heart stop. The aftermath was a blur. Spoke at the memorial service.

Looking at it from my angle there wasn't a choice in the matter. Staying there was damaging my relationship with my kids. It wasn't getting her or I anywhere good.  The kids were not getting along at all and her children were unparentable.  We are so different in how we see parenting and how we parent that it wasn't crossing over at all. And every time I tried to help she would undermine what I was doing. She is the prototypical helicopter mom, saving her kids at every junction. but then they just learn they can do what ever they want. But my girlfriend still thought we should live together. Even though her middle child was in juvenile detention for the majority of the year and was coming back. We both agreed that she needed to get him out of the town we were living in and that my son and her's should live together. But still blames me for breaking up our unit. And I guess that's it I never saw it as a unit. So the end result it that I look like the bad guy to my girlfriend, but I feel so much better with my kids and know I did the right thing.",30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPNE0HQQ,,0.0,retold

Even though safety issues began to happen more and more, our supervisor simply kept piling on more work. Her boss told her it wasn't important and we could skip doing it, but my supervisor wanted to impress everyone and be ""number 1"" so she ignored all advice. Whispers began behind her back, the other pharmacists began to worry about their licenses but the pressure just kept mounting. I found the wrong pills in a bottle on the shelf and my supervisor got mad at me, even though I had not filled from that bottle at all that week. Nothing was ever mentioned again and I began to lie awake at 3 in the morning wondering if the wrong medication had gone out unnoticed before or since. This income was so important to my family, the job was so important to my self-worth but I knew if anything happened I would be liable no matter who was truly at fault. My job had been toxic to begin with, my supervisor was abusive and infamous in our company for being a nasty person. My coworkers trained me by yelling at me and then arguing and ranting with each other in Spanish about me. But I persisted, I did not want to let them win. Every morning I hoped I would get in a car wreck serious enough that I could not work for the foreseeable future. I snapped at my husband, I snapped at my child. Every moment not spent at work was filled with crushing dread that I would have to go back in a few hours. My marriage suffered greatly, my self-esteem was trashed. Yet still I kept on. But that one little tablet of Tramadol was enough to snap me out of it. I was terrified, someone with over a decade of experience had mistakenly put a controlled substance into a bottle of blood pressure medication. And no one caught it. The counts of the controlled medication done every day weren't off? That seemed odd to me, every tablet of those is so tightly accounted for that someone either counted wrong or they noticed but didn't have time to deal with the paperwork so they brushed it aside. How many times had it happened before? Why was I being blamed? These questions ate at me and ate at me until I realized I was killing myself for a job that would throw me under the bus even knowing criminal charges could be brought against me when I didn't do anything wrong. So I quit even though now we are relying on food banks and credit to make do.",30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C71PZ09,,0.0,retold

I was on the phone, helping a patient, and also filling prescriptions as fast as I could. The pharmacist in charge (PIC) was picking her nose while telling me to go faster, faster, faster. I felt so angry that she wouldn't even pick up the phone and put someone on hold while us techs were working at such dangerous paces. And then it happened. A customer asked me to count their pills again so they knew they were receiving the right amount. I understood why, we were visibly overworked and understaffed, but was also very irritated at having yet another task added to my plate. I grabbed the vial, dumped it out, and then my blood ran cold. The PIC stopped digging in her nose and looked down at the same time I did--she lead by micromanaging us right down to how many times a day we urinated, and she started whisper yelling at me. There was a very dangerous drug mixed in with the blood pressure pills. How it happened, who initially put the wrong drug in the wrong bottle, who verified it at the final check, it didn't matter. This was not a failure of the multi-step process or the team in her eyes. No, the fault was mine and mine alone. My bladder was strained, my feet hurt, and I could not safely multitask another day. I went home and thought about it, obsessed over it, dreamed about it. I showed up for work the next day and worried over every patient. I worried that the other techs were not able to work safely either, that the other pharmacists were so worried about whether patients were coming in for vaccinations to meet a goal that I was actually going to kill someone next time. I worried that someone was sitting down to take the wrong medicine right that moment and there was nothing I could do.  The next day was my day off and I felt dread, crippling dread. And then I woke up at 3 in the morning and realized I didn't have to go in the next day. I didn't have to go back ever again. So without warning, without thought I quit. Just like that. My family is broke but I didn't kill someone that day.",30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C71PZ09,30LB5CDZNDWCKT1V77CH7Q2C71PZ09,0.0,recalled

This home had 4 acres and a 6 car garage which we fell in love with.  After a visit to a bank for a pre approval we have decided to list our home as for sale by owner on zillow make me move to make the offer seem better contingent on sale of our home. The evening of us making an offer on the house we liked they have accepted an offer overbidding the asking price. Being that our home was still on the market on zillow I had a realtor reach out to me to show the house to his client. A few days later a lady came with her realtor and spent about an hour touring the home.  By the end of the tour she deicded to buy the house for full asking price for a cash deal. I was really surprised and thrown off by this especially since there was no other lined up home for us to purchase. I could not say no to an offer that was presented even with circumstances of us not having anywhere to go at the moment. Because the deal was a cash sale there was not much but a home inpection and closing date was chosen 3 weeks from signing the sale agreement. In the span of 3 weeks we found a rental with only a week left to closing. In a manner of 1 day we moved the entire home into a very nice rental while we shop for a new home. The whole course of the three weeks before closing were extremely stressful and chaotic in midst of trying to find a rental that quickly and hoping things would not fall through with inspection or the sale after signing a lease and moving all our belongings.  Overall it was a very unique experience and I could not be happier. We are still searching for the right house btw.,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFI8P9JM,,0.0,retold

While doing so I listed my house for sale by owner. While a house I wanted to purchase did not work out my home still was for sale online and someone decided to see it.  A few days later a lady came over to look at the house with her realtor. She spent about an hour there checking it out. About an hour after leaving her realtor called and they put a cash offer on my house that I could not refuse. Because she was a cash buyer the sale of the house was scheduled within 3 weeks of signing the agreement. I went from casually looking for a house to 3 weeks out from the sale. I had to quickly find a rental while I look for my new house. It took me almost 10 days to find a place that I wanted to sign a lease for but I did end up finding one. Between getting the keys and signing the papers I had a total of 6 days to move my entire home.  The home inspection went well then it was down to the closing. The closing went smoothly and I walked out no longer being a home owner. Definitely a really random and stressful situation that worked great in my favor. All in all it was a great success.,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFI8P9JM,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFI8P9JM,0.0,recalled

I had spent the last four years in school and all my hard work had finally paid off. As I was getting dressed in the back, my mind was racing. I was surrounded by my friends and future colleagues. We can all say that we had finally made it to the finish line. All those long nights and the endless amount of homework was finally coming to an end. Many of had jobs lined up for us and if we didn't we were excellent prospects. As the lady in the front gave the signal, we all lined up and walked into the reception area, we were all greeted by our loved ones. The ones who stood by us and supported us as we made this transition into the ""real world"". We sat silently as they called our names. As the names were called, we one by one, stood and shook the president of the school's hand. We each took a quick photo and moved to accept our diploma. All the cheering and support bought tears to my eyes. It was happy and sad tears. I was sad to see all my friends go in different directions, but I was happy that they were all starting a new chapter in their lives. The graduation was short, but it was a memorable one.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQPPASP,0.0,recalled

We had a very small wedding with only our children and my grandparents attending.  George has two daughters that are five and eight.  And, I have one daughter that is eight and one son who is four.  My son Ryan is a very active and curious little boy.  We were married in a gazebo at a park.  The park was filled beautiful gardens and a lake with a water feature in the middle.  Our wedding day was on a beautiful summer day.  During the ceremony the local ducks decided to join us.  The ducks made a mess on the floor of the gazebo.  As we were saying our vows, Ryan noticed the ducks and decided to check them out.  He dashed to the area of the gazebo, where the ducks were.  As he ran toward them, he slipped and fell in the duck's poop and tripped over my grandmother's feet, soiling her shoes.  By that time the ducks decided to leave and they waddled towards the lake.  When Ryan got up from tripping over my grandmother's feet, he chased after the ducks.  By this time we saw Ryan chasing the ducks and going towards the lake.  George and I stopped saying our vows to each other and chased after Ryan.  But, it was too late to catch him before he got to the lake.  To our dismay, Ryan fell in the lake.  Thank goodness the water was not deep at the edge and we were able to get to him safely.  After all the drama, we went back to the Gazabo and continued saying our vows.

Foraging for food in the landscape around me is a real thing and I can do it. I started thinking about the plants around me when I saw a foraging video on YouTube. A teacher was showing students about all of the edible plants in a park that happens to be near my house. I was interested in the video as I have alot of experience with gardening and it dawned upon me that I could do this too. I started looking up plants online and watching other videos about plant identification. I started slowly by looking for one single type of plant and trying to identify it multiple times. After I was confident that I could identify the plant, I ate a couple of leaves just to test out the effects of it. I would wait a day and when nothing happened negative, I became more confident in my id's. I ate more the next time and continued to find out as much as I could about the plants habitat and features. Immersing myself in one plant at a time has been a great way to expand my knowledge. Now I can identify many plants in my area. I know the leaves, fruits, colors and features of a number of edible plants. This has given me a food source other than buying food from the grocery. It's amazing to see something all around you that was always there but you never saw before. I am very glad to have stumbled upon this field of knowledge.",31LVTDXBL8WGFY4QMJ4NJ7S1QAXLR0,,0.0,retold

It is kind of shocking to learn that there is so much plenty all around and yet we live in deprivation. I learned about it after I watched a video on it. It really opened my eyes and showed me something new. I did a bunch of reading and research which prepared me to go into the parks around me and find things. There is lots of food in the local parks in big cities. There is even stuff growing in the sidewalk planters. Things we call ""weeds"" are actually nutritious and delicious plants. I have grown alot since I woke up to all this. My horizons have expanded. My consciousness has increased. My self-reliance and self-trust has gone up. It has been a great experience.

No one seems to know what it is and my story has been posted all over the place. We even went to Area 51 Raid and got to tell our story and make some great friends. The UFO I saw was a long bright light. It could be a kite tail but then where was the person holding it? The object has been spotted again in town and all over the country. It would be cool to see it again when we film it next week. The discovery channel is coming out to do one of those corny reenactments. If this was a kite I wonder why the guy did say anything. He would have seen us. I rewatched the video a bunch. At least 11 people stopped to talk about the light. They had seen it from far away and had come to watch.

We had spent about five hours in the late afternoon looking before it got dark and we decided to head home. We were driving thru a town next to the park called 29 Palms that has a marine base in it when we saw a UFO from the car! It was a long bright light in the sky that was out in the desert. We pulled over and started to film the object and talk about what it was. It didn't seem to move much in the air and didn't seem far away. My Girlfriend was driving and figured we might be able to get closer to it (we were about a mile away) so we drove down some streets to get to it. We were able to drive right up too it and film it for about 25 minutes. The light looked like a long glowing ribbon in the sky that made no noise. It was very windy but was able to control itself against the wind and would lift up into the sky a few hundred feet and come back down less then one hundred feet about our heads. Many other people started to stop and see the UFO. After close to 30 minutes since we originally saw the object it started to move away from up and against the wind making us get back in our cars and drive another street over to it. As we pulled up we saw the item come down to the ground and turn off. Myself, my Friend and 9 other people that stopped to see the UFO all ran out of our cars and into the desert to look for it, but we couldn't find it at all. We couldn't figure out where it went or what it was. The most likely explanation was it was a light up tail of a kite or a rope on a drone but it made no noise so drone is out, if it's a kite where was the guy holding it? They had to have seen all these people stopped on the side of the road looking and running into the desert to find it. There are some powerlines that cross between where we stood under the object and where it came down so that's not safe and how did it not get stuck? I have tried looking for the object online but can't find anyone selling anything similar to it and the videos online do not look like my video or the object we saw. On the drive home I uploaded the video I took of the UFO, now most of my videos are of animals so this one was a little out of place but by morning had thousands of people emailing, messaging,  commenting on the video asking questions trying to figure it out. A number of large UFO and paranormal Youtubers reached out to me to use the footage on their shows and podcasts! It was really cool and a lot of fun and I was asked to be interviewed for a show on the travel channel which I did and was also a lot of fun.",31N2WW6R9SC2W49SPI0T6WK1X65F3H,31N2WW6R9SC2W49SPI0T6WK1X65F3H,0.0,recalled

I found out that my wife is pregnant with our first child!  When I first found out I was overcome with emotions.  At first I was so happy and excited because we had been trying for so long to get pregnant.  Then I was overcome with sadness.  You see my dad passed away a couple years ago.  In my eulogy I spoke how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me.  That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement.  I wouldn't be able to call him for advice.  My wife is now about 6 months pregnant.  Still to this day I have highs and lows because of these two things.  Highs because I am so excited to be a dad.  Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me.  We found out we are having a girl!  I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl I was so ecstatic.  I immediately went into papa bear mode.  I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl.  What I needed to know about having a girl.  I know that she is going to be the most important thing in my life.

She loved the books growing up and was really excited to see it live. We couldnt get close parking and had to park in a lot a few streets down. As we were about to enter the venue i heard a loud thump and see this girl, who was about ten, launched into the air. She hit the ground hard and was not moving. The noisy city street turned silent after that. No one was moving to help and i knew i had to do something. I have basic medical training so i rushed over to the little girl. I pointed out someone in the crowd to call 911. As he was on the phone with them i made sure that no one would move her. I noticed that she was not breathing and tried to administer cpr to her. It seemed like it wasnt working at all and right when i was about to give up hope a little breathe escaped from her mouth. I instantly felt a sigh of relief come across my body. I knew we werent safe though. She clearly had broken her arm and one of her legs. She started to come to and in she was panicked. I helped comfort her and tried to keep her calm and still. Luckily the EMTs arrived shortly after that. They loaded her on a stretcher and took her to the hospital. Her mother was a complete wreck the whole time, and i could not blame her. I do not know if could have kept my cool if it was my daughter in that position. We missed the show but I was not saddened by that fact.

We had been dating for about 6 months prior to the breakup. Everything was going okay enough, but recently we had started fighting more often and his communication skills left something to be desired. I remember I told him that we needed to talk, and asked him to give me a call when he got done with work. I sat in my car in the Target parking lot waiting for his call for a couple hours. I like to have difficult conversations in my car, because it feels intimate, but then I have the option to drive and clear my head. My stomach dropped when my music cut out and saw his name on the phone screen. We small talked for a few minutes, and the conversation felt strained/off on both our sides. I finally let him know the reason I wanted to talk is because I just couldn't do this anymore. I had spent so much time recently being unhappy and emotional, and I didn't see a pathway out of that for us. There was a lot of silence and ""I wasn't expecting this"". He acknowledged that he hadn't been listening to what I told him I wanted and needed, so he was beating himself up and blaming himself. We both cried, a lot on the call. I tried to reassure him that I respected him and didn't have any bad feelings toward him, it's just a relationship wasn't working for us. He was so kind and had so many nice things to say to me, that in that moment I wondered if I was doing the right thing. The whole conversation was so emotional and I'll never forget hanging up that phone, and feeling a weight being lifted off me.

She was scheduled to have knee replacement surgery before she passed away.  She was having a normal day on the day she passed away.  She had a meeting with someone from her church that morning.  She went outside to show her friend her garden and then her friend left.  She was in her garden when she suddenly had a massive aneurysm.  We had video footage from security cameras to show us exactly what happened.  She put her hands to her head and then she dropped to 1 knee.  She braced herself temporarily before falling to the ground completely.  My brother found her a few minutes later and called an ambulance.  She was basically on life support from that time until she passed away about 8 hours later.  It has been 5 months since it happened and it still seems so surreal.  I miss her smile and I miss her laugh.  She had the best laugh!

It was so enriching to spend time with my siblings because we don't get to do that often enough. This event was also memorable for one other reason.  My brother bought the tickets last December when they first went on sale.  He bought enough for everyone, including my oldest brother's wife.  She was so excited - she had never seen ELO live.  Unfortunately, something tragic happened just 6 weeks before the concert.  She was outside in her garden and she had a massive aneurysm.  She was rushed to the hospital but it was too late.  She passed away that night.  We lost someone very special and dear to our hearts and the pain was palpable.  My oldest brother decided he didn't want to go to the concert after she passed away.  He said it just didn't feel right.  After numerous conversations, we convinced him to go.  His oldest son took her place.

It really resented with me as a child because it was always in the presence of teachers and instead of doing anything about it, they laughed at him. It was some really early memories that I have of not feeling protected.

Nothing he did was even all that bad, just hiding and jump scaring everyone mostly. As an adult, it was the first time I had seen him in a long time and to be face to face with someone that I considered a bully growing up was so odd. Turns out, he was still joking around and kidding and being the same as I remembered him, but without the childlike thoughts of malice that I used to have. It really made an impact on me seeing him now with eyes that have grown and understood. I mentally forgave him for the pain he put me through as a kid.

As an adult, I better understood things and seeing him do the same things he did to me (jump scaring, saying he was eating a cat when it was a  regular burger, etc) seeing him do that to other kids, I see how it's harmless.

Although my leg is still a bit stiff, the physical therapy sessions have helped. Since my injury, I've been a little too careful with my activity. That's lead to some atrophy in the muscle in my leg. I have been trying to do lower body exorcises and be more active in general.  The psychological aspect of a bone breaking has been the hardest to overcome. Will I break the leg again because it is weak?  Do I always have to be ""on guard"" and careful? I guess time will help with that. The insurance payments for the injury have been ridiculous. I receive large bills from the medical providers. I call my insurance company and they tell me that they will pay the bill, just be patient. This continues for months. Finally, after months, the insurance company pays up. I guess the game here is to hope that the insured will pay some or all of the bills just to see the paper onslaught stop.

I was working on a ladder painting my house. After a long afternoon of painting, I was feeling a bit tired and began to descend the ladder. I missed a rung on the ladder and fell about 9 feet. When I hit the ground, I felt incredible pain in my left leg. After standing up and trying to walk, I couldn't put any pressure on my leg and the pain was almost overwhelming. Luckily, my wife was home at the time and drove me to the hospital. After waiting for over an hour, I was finally seen by a doctor in the emergency room.  The doctor began the examination by moving my leg and I nearly screamed from the pain. He gave my a shot filled with pain medication of some kind and sent me for a x-ray. The x-ray determined that my leg had fractured just below the knee.  Luckily, it was a clean break. I was given a flexible cast, a prescription for antibiotics and pain pills, and sent home. It has now been about a month since the accident. I am no longer in pain. The flex cast can come off in about two weeks. I am grateful to have recovered and I will take ladders more seriously the next time I paint my house!",32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSFSUH,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TGXSFSUH,0.0,recalled

She went into labor and I was running around like a crazy man trying to find her bag.  I finally got her into the car and headed to the hospital.  The hospital is only like ten minutes from my house, but on the way there, we got stopped in a line of cars that was waiting to let a family of ducks cross the road. My wife was trying to do her breathing, but kind of freaking out because she kept saying the baby was going to come any minute.  We finally got moving after like 10 minutes. I rushed her into the hospital where they immediately checked her and took her to the delivery room because there was no time to wait. The baby came so fast after that. My wife lost more blood than the doctor was comfortable with so we spent two days in the hospital. They felt it was okay to let me take my wife and baby boy home again after that. The nurses were really friendly. The doctor made sure to check everything. The baby was bigger than we thought he would be. He was 9 pounds.

We spent the next two days in the hospital. Nurses and doctors came in and out to check on him and run tests throughout our stay.

Ideally it would have a shorter commute.  It would be ideal if I did not need to travel in to the city anymore for the new job as well.  I applied to over 10 jobs, and interviewed at 3 of those.  One of the jobs seemed like an ideal fit, no more commute to the large city, great benefits and I really enjoyed the interview.  I had been referred to this one by a friend. I decided to be extra pursuant of that position and requested a follow up interview via phone myself, and I was thrilled when they told me they had planned to call me.  At the second interview I met many more of the staff and they seemed very impressed with my skill set. Today I let my manager and coworkers know that I was resigning, and leaving the company in 2 weeks.  Some of my coworkers where beside themselves.  I found it hard to say goodbye.

This resort was located on the beach and had full service amenities. On the day of her birthday we decided to take it easy and swim by the pool. We ordered breakfast and mimosa's and the staff brought it to us. The meal consisted of poached eggs, hashbrowns, biscuits, and gravy. They even brought us a fresh bowl of fruit. We decided to take a walk after we ate and picked up shells on the beach. Just seeing her smile made me happy. That afternoon we decided to have a short nap before the real fun began. She made sure to fix her hair and make-up for our big night out. Her dress was, as blue as, the ocean and made her eye's shine. I decided on a nice blue polo shirt and a pair of cargo shorts. Around 5 we departed our room for dinner at the resort's restaurant. The atmosphere was serene and romantic. I handed my wife her gift and when she opened up the box tears fell from her eyes. It was a special bracelet with our children's birthstones. She has been such a great wife and mother that the gift seem a little cheap. We ordered our food which consisted of crab legs, salad, and clam chowder. We wanted it to be a light meal since we were heading the beach club for a night of drinking and dancing. The servers surprised her at the end of dinner with a big slice of chocolate cake and sang happy birthday. Her face seemed to turn red as they danced around the table. After paying the bill we jumped in a taxi and went out to dance. Carlos was a small dance club on the south side of the resort. We were able to get our own VIP table and they brought us a bucket of champagne. I popped the cork with great pleasure and made a toast to my wife in her honor.",,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM275AGIJ,0.0,imagined

Traveling on the highways makes me nervous because of all the unexpected stresses that can happen but I set that aside and bought the tickets.  In anticipation of some stresses I tried to mitigate that by purchasing the special up close and determined parking, and a fast pass so I wouldn't have to wait in line.  I even surprised myself by driving the whole way to the city.  I drove to the otherskirts of the city to a place we planned to eat.  From there things got stressful because parking was difficult, and it was a busy pedestrian area.  The parking meters wouldn't work and the person I was with was aggravated that I didn't just want to park there anyway.  I was worried about being towed in a city that wasn't mine, shortly before this thing I wanted to do.  We ended up getting a new parking spot but that was strike one.  After that we found out way to the venue okay and parked relatively easily.  It was a pleasant day, not too hot, and it was nice to find the fast pass line to be not very long.  Then when we arrived for the outdoor concert we were given nice little lawn chairs to sit in.  We sat our chairs directly behind the back railing of the front standing room area.  We had a good view and the closest area you could sit on with the lawn chairs.  I started to feel more relaxed and ventured off on my own to buy a t-shirt while my partner saved our spot.  Unbeknownst to me, my partner was very uncomfortable in the little chairs and started to have negative feelings about the situation they found themselves in.  When I returned and mentioned I saw they were selling beers, my partner snapped at me in front of other people, why I hadn't gotten them one, then got up in a huff to go do it themselves.  I had to try to ignore that comment for the sake of appearances and to try not to ruin my night as I was essentially stuck here.  The rest of the evening proceeded find until the band came one and almost immediately what one would call an obnoxious frat boy took up the space directly in front of me, and the people next to me.  He was annoying for 90% of the concert.  The concert itself, was great.  The band put on an absolutely great show, the evening was pleasant, it was an outdoor venue, and it wasn't too hot.  When leaving on the way home, we got lost because I wanted to listen to the radar detector, which was actually wrong.  So it made for even more tense moments.  I decided at that point I was done with concert travel for a while.",32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM2A02IG6,,0.0,retold

I don't really enjoy travel due to the traffic and stress but decided that I would go to see my favorite band.  I immediately purchased the tickets when I was able to get them on presale and I also purchased special parking.  As the day of the concert slowly approached I became anxious about the travel.  I started thinking that maybe I should just sell the tickets since it was  a sold out show.  In the end, I decided against it.  On the day of the concert I was the one to drive the whole way there, including to a restaurant in the heart of the city.  I was pleased I'd made it that far without a large amount of stress. From the restaurant my partner drove us to the concert.  We had fast pass so got inside with a shorter line.  It was a pleasant day for an outdoor concert and we even had lawn chairs provided by the venue.  The concert and evening was better than expected even though my partner was cranky about their seating arrangement.  It was a wonderful night in a good setting, even though the 22 year old in front of me was drunk and obnoxious the whole concert.  The group I was going to see surpassed how I thought they would perform live.  Even my partner who didn't really like or dislike the band commented on what a good show it was.  Even now reminiscing I'm pleased I changed my mind and went. And looking back, even though we got unnecessarily lost on the way home and fought regarding that, (when I wasn't driving), the concert itself was worth it.",32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM2A02IG6,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM2A02IG6,0.0,recalled

It was a huge day for all of us and something we had looked forward to for many many years, but especially the last few months. There was a ton of food and decorations at his celebration party. Most of his friends and a lot of family came from really far away. Some even came as far as 4 states away to be at his Graduation and at his party. He got a lot of gifts and a lot of warm wishes from people, but the thing he wanted the most didn't happen. His biological father did not come. For me, that was ok because he has always been a bit violent and a huge trouble maker. But for my son it was really a thing, because he wanted his biological father to see him Graduate and to show him that he made it this far in life without his help. His father and I had a falling out when I was pregnant and he said some things that cannot be forgiven. He has never been there for my son so I wasn't really surprised. Despite not liking him I had hoped he would be there for my son so that he could be spared hurt. In the end though, everything went well and it made my heart swell with pride to see my son Graduate and get his diploma. We had a rough start in our life and it was the best feeling in the world to see all our sacrifices dissipate as he walked across that state. Now he can move on to bigger and better things.

L. was very active in my life during our college years.  She'd have Pat and I over for dinner every month or so.  And I got to know and love her greatly.  L. passed away last month after battling her condition for years.  It was time for her to go, and I'm sure that everyone was greatly relieved to have an end to her great suffering.  Well it just so happens that I'd been planning a trip with my friend Brian to visit another friend Ashley and his family who'd moved last year to Colorado for work.  It'd taken us a long time to find a time that would work for our schedules, and we booked the non-refundable tickets and paid the deposit on our Air bnb.  Of course the funeral happened to occur on the very day we were to leave.  When I found out, I was distraught.  I don't know why it hit me so hard.  I just felt like a heel.  I thought of cancelling my trip.  I probably should have, but I spoke with Pat and Brian and Ashley, and everyone said I shouldn't change my plans.

All white Americans are the descendants of people who immigrated, most over 100 years ago. I like how Andrew Yang wants to give a ""freedom dividend."" This means that every American over 18 will get $1,000 a month ""no strings attached."" Personally I think that with automation and AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the future there are not going to be enough jobs for people. ""If you brought it a trucker brought it."" It is safe to say that soon cars and trucks are going to be self driving. Within a decade your food order and a fast food restaurant will most likely be prepared by a robot. The self checkout lines at Target and Walmart are just the start, pretty robots will be stocking the shelves and running the warehouse. Yes, some high paying tech IT and engineering jobs will be created, but not enough to off set the loss of jobs. However, I LOVE robotics and AI (Artificial Intelligence). Just think of all of the accidents that self driving cars will prevent. Wouldn't it be awesome to relax  on your way to work and let the car drive itself? I favor and agree and lot with moderate Republicans. However, I think that Trump realizes that in the future there will not be enough jobs for the working and middles classes due to AI (Artificial Intelligence). He wants to avoid a situation where Universal Basic Income would need to be implemented. My theory is that he wants to get rid of all of the immigrant workers. He then will install tough work standards for people to get public assistance (Welfare/Food Stamps). Who would pay for Universal Basic Income, $1,000 a month for every American over 18? You need a thousand million to make a billion. To just crack the top 1% for a given year for a couple filling jointly or a single person looking at total income (wages, capital gains, and inheritances) you would need about $469,000 annually.

I live in Ohio and flew to Ireland via New York City. Around the turn of the century my great grand parents came to America from Ireland. They both came through Ellis Island in New York City. At first they lived in Buffalo, New York. Around 1910 they ended up in Cleveland, Ohio. After my plane landed in New York City from Ireland I decided to take the subway train into New York City. I walked around New York City. I ate some food at Wendys. By Wall Street I got on the Stanton Island Ferry. The Stanton Island ferry goes past Ellis Island where my great grandparents entered America over a century ago! After seeing New York City I had to drive seven hours back to Ohio. It is a seven hour drive. The New York turnpike runs south of Buffalo, New York. I was going to try to find the hotel in Buffalo that my great grandparents meet at. I was not able to do this on this trip because I had to get home. However, the Layette Hotel in Buffalo is still there.",32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3POPEK9,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3POPEK9,0.0,recalled

It was perfect. There are people who I wish had been able to attend, but I was still able to see many friends and family who I hadn't for some time. When my husband and I walked out of the temple, everyone was there to greet us and take pictures and give hugs. My husband looked perfect in his charcoal grey tux, and we couldn't stop smiling the whole time. We hired a photographer to take pictures, but my grandpa's a photographer too, so he buzzed around and took a lot of photos too. We had a reception afterwards in the Riverwoods conference center. Our reception hall turned out really beautiful, and our parents said the sweetest things. I got to meet one of my husband's sisters for the first time. A couple who my family knew when we lived in Dubai several years ago even came! Some other friends from overseas were able to attend as well, so I was really great to see them again. Everything went really smoothly, and I think everyone had a wonderful time.",,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAPJ05P6F,0.0,recalled

It was the first time that my husband and I had taken our little ones on a long trip. We only went about four hours from home, but it felt like we were a world away! The car ride went more smoothly than I thought it would with a baby in the car. Granted, we did leave in the early hours of the morning, so the kids slept for a little while. We stayed in a community of rental homes in a very nice neighborhood. The house was beautiful and it met all of our needs for the trip. There was also a huge lagoon style pool on the property that we made use of during our stay. The kids had a blast swimming in it. I think the most exciting part of our trip was seeing our little girl (3) at the beach for the first time. She was just in awe of everything. She kept running down to the water and running back across the sand, and her excitement was just infectious. It means a lot to me that we are able to take our kids to do things like this and have fun experiences, because I know a lot of people are not so lucky. We are not rich by any means, but as long as we can give our kids love and a taste of life, I am happy. It filled my heart to see her so enjoying herself.

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,0.0,recalled

This came as a surprise as I have only been at this job for eight months and there are people who have been there longer. I do feel as though I've been putting in more work than the others that I work with, but I was expecting it any more. This is a really significant milestone for me. I felt nervous coming into this job because it was out of my wheelhouse in terms of things that I've done in the past. Because of this, I've found myself coming in earlier and staying later to make sure that I have a grasp on all the things that I need to do here. It seems like this persistence impressed my supervisors and they went to the boss to ask that I be given a promotion and a raise. This is really a culmination of the effort I've put in to be a better employee and I'm happy with the result. Of course, I am. It's a promotion and a raise after only a short time at the job. This also means that if I decide to move on from this job that I will look better in the eyes of potential employers who may be interested in my services. I took this job on a whim, to be honest. I was unhappy at my last job and wanted to find a chance. After a few months, this is where I ended up. Now, I'm excelling at this new job and finding that my supervisors are aware of what I am doing. I think that I can make a longer career out of my time here if I continue on this road.

I had just moved my wife and 2 kids from Pennsylvania to New York.  Getting into a new house was really stressful for all of us. Once we had arrived saying that he had passed on. I had talked to my parents on a daily basis over the phone and no one even let me know he was sick. If I had known I would have tried to spend more time with him.  As soon as I got the call I booked a flight for myself and my family. My kids were heartbroken and I didn't know what to say to make them feel better. I helped my mom plan the memorial service. She was obviously distraught so I hope you're as much as I possibly could. It seems like she was not prepared for this either. At least we had each other to lean on in this difficult time. The day of the funeral service I ran into family I hadn't seen in many many years. I really didn't wanna speak with them for the most part because I was so upset, but I was just polite and cordial as I could be. The main thing was that I was there for my family and I remain strong for them. When it was all said and done we took a flight back to New York.

A beautiful lake that the wedding venue looked over. We all spent time on the deck drinking and smoking cigars. One of the shocking events was watching my cousin (female) smoking a cigar with the men. Then to top it off her mom who was 70+ comes out and takes the cigar from her and takes a few puffs on it. Again the reason it was meaningful to me was it had been 10+ years since I had seen many of the people. My wife and I actually were thinking that we last saw them when my wife was pregnant with our 12 year old daughter. It was the first time I actually danced at a formal event with my daughter.

Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends. I also got to see her family for the first time in a while which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party, it was only family members and that made me feel quite warm. It also was the first time I got to see my friends new house. She had been living with her spouse and baby at her mom's house since she was pregnant and it was very exciting to see them moving out and being more independent. While I love her family, it is always good to have your own space as an adult. I really look forward to our kids growing up together and couldn't be happier still.

My sister and I went to the cemetery where my father is buried to make arrangements to have her interred. It was a very sad, difficult week as she'd been on life support and we'd had to make the decision to remove her from the respirator. The doctors said she'd only live a few hours but she lived for several days and seemed really uncomfortable and in pain. It was a very difficult thing to watch and my sister and I were both kind of traumatized when we walked into our meeting with the funeral director. We knew that my mother had asked for a simple graveside service as most of her friends had passed away. We explained this to the funeral director and she really put pressure on us to upsell everything. We keep refusing, wanting to keep it simple, and this woman made us feel so uncomfortable - and cheap, which we aren't - that I was starting to get upset. After more than an hour of this woman pressuring us we finally made the arrangement we'd planned. We then went out to lunch just to recover from the verbal pummeling of this woman. The day finally arrived and after picking up flowers we got to the cemetery early. The service itself was nice. It was a pretty spring day and quite a few family members came. The funeral director was nice to us, which was a change from when we made the arrangements. Despite the awful experience of planning this it turned out well.",3300DTYQT332XRFYSISJ1MSCTG1EQY,,0.0,retold

The entire process was sad and painful but at least we had each other to get through it. It was stressful at the funeral home because the funeral director was constantly trying to upsell us. The money wasn't the issue. We simply wanted to follow our mother's wishes for a simple gravesite service with her priest present. The funeral director, however, kept pressing us to provide a large tent that was very expensive, as well as other amenities that we didn't think would be necessary but she literally browbeat us for more than an hour to agree to them. We were both very upset when we got back to our car. We didn't have a choice of where to go as my father is buried at the same cemetery and of course we wanted them to be together. It made a stressful time even more stressful. It simply wasn't necessary. On the day of the funeral it was a lovely Spring day, my mom's favorite season. We had a gravesite service and her priest did a beautiful job. I was surprised and moved when my brother-in-law's mother, who was close friends with my mother, quoted an Irish blessing that my mom always loved.

He requires precision from everyone around him.  He started asking a lot of questions about the food options. The waiter became offended, even though there was nothing offensive about the questions. But the waiter didn't like my brother's tone of voice.  At one point he stepped back and said ""I don't need to be talked to like that.""  It was kind of sad.

My brother ended up getting something he didn't really love, because he felt bad about what happened, and had decided to stop asking questions.

A number of family members had traveled some distance to be there.  Our first night out was to be at a large family style Chinese restaurant.  We arrived, and a large round table was set and waiting for us.  My brother sat near me on my left.  My brother is a gentle person, but can sometimes appear to have a gruff, adversarial or judgmental tone.  When the waiter came to speak to us, my brother asked him if the salt and pepper dish (can't recall what it was, beyond the salt and pepper part) was spicy.  The waiter answered that it was not. My brother, in asking for clarification, spoke in a tone that seemed to offend the waiter.  He (my brother), said ""But the menu says it has salt and pepper on it."" The waiter seemed to jump back, and said (quite haughtily) that he would not be spoken to in that way.  After this exchange, my brother became quiet. I think he had no idea that the waiter had been offended.  I, who am used to my brother's questioning ways, was very surprised to see the waiter act so offended.

I worked on my resume and case for weeks on end to ensure i had the best chance of getting the position. i got into a few spats with coworkers about who should be promoted as well. this caused a lot of tension among us and made actual work tough for nearly a month. we had a first wave of interviews that knocked out half of the applicants. this made things even worse as some longer tenured employees were not pushed through to the second round of interviews. i was lucky enough to be pushed through myself. after the second round, we had two days where we did not know who had won the position. this was also stressful for us and put more tension on the office and all of us personally, as it was a life changing event for anyone who won the spot due to the salary and our life trajectories. after a few days, my manager called me into his office and informed me that i had won the position. this was a surprise to me as i thought other members were favored over me and would get the position. i was ecstatic to win the spot, as my salary more than doubled and i got great benefits. despite the stresses i was very happy with the situation.",336KAV9KYREJBDU4Q8ECC7MPWGC2YW,336KAV9KYREJBDU4Q8ECC7MPWGC2YW,0.0,recalled

It's a very warm and nice feeling to have your own place with someone you love. It took us about a week to find something nice and affordable in our area, so we bounced around hotels for that time and treated it like a bit of a vacation and a getting used to living with each other experience. We found a place we liked though and moved the very next day. It was a bit of a leap from how things used to be, but I'm glad I took the leap. It was definitely time in my life to try this out as I'm already 25 now. Heck, most of my friends are getting married now so I feel almost like an oddball. It's ok though because I'm happier going at my own pace. I'd say this has been a good choice though. I believe it will only bring my partner and I closer than we ever have been before.

We finally decided on an affordable spot that wasn't too far away from our previous homes, and we moved in together. This was my first time ever living with a romantic partner, and also her first time as well. In addition, it was a new experience in that we did not have an HOA. Both of us were used to living in one, and having to pay dues for that as well as follow a color scheme. I loved that I no longer had to conform to the rules and regulations of a seemingly pointless organization. To celebrate this, my partner and I decided to explore the area to find things to decorate our new yard with. We found an old school nursery nearby, (even the main business sign was a big piece of hand painted wood), and we bought some plants. Well, about 18 plants to be exact, and all but two of them were fruit or vegetable producing. So we planted these outside in our new yard to harvest. Besides the lack of HOA, we also didnt have to worry about pet fees, which was another thing neither of us were used to. Naturally, we had to celebrate this as well. Instead of a traditional dog or cat, we ended up getting 5 pets. These include 2 leopard geckos (one albino one regular), a veiled chameleon, a roboroverski hamster, and a havana rabbit. It's felt so freeing and wonderful living with my life partner, and being able to experience our new place the way we really want to.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U7G2M54,,0.0,retold

I wanted to change that because I remember that I had a really fun childhood. My parents really went above and beyond to make sure I enjoyed my time as a kid. I've always held those values with me and wanted to pass them along to my daughter. So, I brainstormed ideas and I settled on the idea of setting up a movie theater in the backyard. I went online and did some research to get some inspiration on how to set it up. Once I had a solid idea of how I wanted to pull it off, I went to work researching projectors to find the best bang for my buck. I found a few on Amazon that I liked and, upon watching reviews on YouTube, I picked the one that was best. Surprisingly, it wasn't that expensive. I think I paid less than $300 for the whole setup. After I placed the order, I looked at my schedule to find a good night to do the movie night. When I had the details figured out, I informed my wife and she loved the idea. Before long, the movie projector came and tested it in my office while my daughter was playing outside. The quality and ease of use were impressive. It was able to be hooked up to a DVD player or a phone/tablet, which was perfect for us. I then waited until the night that I wanted to set things up. That day, she was out playing with friends and I was in the backyard secretly setting things up. I moved deck furniture and put a big blanket on the lawn. By the time i was done, it looked like a miniature living room. We then prepared snacks and broke the news to my daughter. She jumped up and down with joy before running to the backyard and freaking out over the setup. We had popcorn, candy, and sodas while watching the movie that night. It was so much fun and I really liked creating those memories for her. I felt really good afterwards and feel like I fulfilled my duties as a fun parent.

My parents saw to it that I had a lot of great times to look back on and cherish. In the spirit of that, I wanted to pass on experiences like this to my daughter. This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2. It was an amazing night and I'm so glad I did it.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,0.0,recalled

He is also kind of an airhead so we were worried about how he was going to handle living by himself.  He was going to college about 3.5 hours away from where we live.  Close enough to visit but far enough to not want to do the drive there and back on a regular basis.  We got about half way there and the check engine light came on in my car.  We pulled over at a gas station and loaded all of his stuff into my wife's car.  Then my youngest daughter and I had to say goodbye to him in a gas station parking lot so I could drive the car back home in case something serious was wrong.  It ended up being an electrical issue and was a somewhat costly repair.  My wife and other daughter took him the rest of the way to college.  They got him set up in his dorm, took him out to lunch and then came home.  I was sad that I didn't get to take part in all of that and had my goodbye cut short.

Once she was here, I was so tired and in pain but I was so happy. She was perfect and cute and healthy, I had been so worried she would be born with a defect or disability. But she was so perfect, fat and sleepy and a full head of dark curls. I didn't want the nurses to take her out of the room or out of my sight, I wanted her beside me forever. I didn't expect to feel anything like this, I never really had an interest in children and getting pregnant was a mistake. But as soon as I saw her, I loved her and only wanted to protect her and make her happy. I never expected to feel the amount of love and care and concern that I did feel. Pregnancy was a miserable, sick time for me, and birth was painful and exhausting and overwhelming, but it was all so worth it to make someone so cute and perfect that brings me so much happiness. I know I'm a better person now than I was before I had her, she's taught me so much patience and care and how to be unselfish.

Attending his funeral was very emotional. I was in tears the whole time I was in the room with his body. It was so incredibly unfair to me that this funny, kind, gentle human being was dead at only age 37. He had only just gotten married two years ago. That's all the time he had with his wife: 4 years of dating, 2 years of marriage, and then dead, with no kids to pass on his legacy, all because of a distracted driver. It made me so incredibly sad and also furious at how unfair life is. At the funeral we were encouraged to get up and say a few words. Some of his family did get up, but so did a few people that only seemed to be doing it to draw attention to themselves, like, ""I know he is dead, but have you thought about how *I* feel about it?"" which only made me more mad. Although I hate speaking in front of people, I did go up to talk about what he meant to me. I did not mention how I felt about the other hangers-on who got up to talk, because that would have been very inappropriate for a funeral, but instead tried to draw the focus back to what a wonderful human being this man was. How I never saw him angry, how I never saw him complain, how he always was so fun and jovial and approached each day like a blessing. Later on his wife told me how happy she was about my little speech. I felt glad I could support her. It also made me think about how when I die I want a happy, positive, and small funeral.",33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AWV5117,33CKWXB73K6FWM15VF7PT11AWV5117,0.0,recalled

I'm usually not too great with jokes, but she tends to laugh at most of my dumb ones. We have both changed very much, but it was for the better. Now that we have reconnected I'm feeling better then ever. We went out to the movies last week, and got some dinner after. The resturaunt we went to was right down the street at Tahoe Joe's. I got whiskey peppercorn chicken, and she got a fancy salad of some kind. We went back to my place and started watching amazon's new show the boys. We really enjoyed it (or at least I think she did).

I know that I was supposed to recall a important part of my life, and it seemed like a good story before this started to happen, so I apologize.

Staring right to her face, I knew she was lying.  I questioned it, and she just went into a remorse/emotion state and quickly told me the actual reason. She didn't have a cat. The real reason was because she was questioning her sexuality, and the wedding day was just the necessary straw to break the camel's back. It was quite a shocker for us. We did not know she was a bisexual and had a girlfriend on the side. Apparently she didn't know the extent of her love until the day of the wedding. We wondered if the groom knew as well.  While I was not a close friend of hers, I was not well known of her sexual preference. While I do not think it was a good idea to run away during wedding day, I do not agree with a wedding where vows are made and the infidelity would have started from day 1. I then followed up with what's her plan now. She plans to move away from the town within the next month. She dumped both the groom and the girlfriend soon after her fiasco. She just wanted a fresh start. She also went to the full extent of changing her number as she was getting unwanted calls for being a *itch for running away.

I really regret not spending more time with my father, because as I grew up I know we could of got more close. Me and my father were not that close but he always provided for my family. I appreciated him very much and still miss him to this day. A lot of people helped me get through this experience, it made me stronger mentally and physically. I will try to educate other people about diabetes, and the effects of it. I will do my best to help other people out with diabetes. It is very serious and an epidemic around the world.",33FOTY3KEN7ZJPB3BCW9AXK10SWC18,,0.0,retold

My son ran upstairs and I told him ""this will be his room"" He was so excited to be able to have a room to put is toys in! He said ""I am going to out my clothes and toys here"".  We went to the garage and we pictured our cars in there.  We had never had a garage so we were so happy to finally one.  We put a family picture on top of the fireplace to make it feel more like home.  We also went to our master bedroom and couldn't believe that we finally had our own room. My husband and I began to look around and we began to envision what changes we would do and how our furniture would look.  We were so excited to have a backyard and thought about possible BBQ s with family and friends.  We picture patio chairs and a grill. We also pictured our son running around and playing with his balls. We felt like our dreams have came true!

I get mad at everybody because it is one of my favorite dolls and I've looked everywhere and it's still missing. However, the next day I was so surprised that it is on top of my  birthday cake as part of the decorations. That really brings smiles to my face and I am not only enjoying my birthday but i also felt relieve that I have my old car back. I will never forget those moments and now, every time my birthday is coming and one of my doll is missing. One of the  gift that I have ever given to someone would most likely be the gift I gave to my dad on his fiftieth birthday. I figured it would be special to surprise him on his birthday. My brother and I had a few ideas in mind. My father had wanted these golf clubs, a watch, and other costly purchases, but we only had a limited budget. We finally decided to fix him a surprise dinner that we would put together. I knew he would like something unexpected for a change. Especially, if it was something that me and my brother had came together to do on our own.

I've worked at this store for so long, and became so familiar with my coworkers, the daily routine, the customer's, etc.  My coworkers and I all supported each other through the process since it was new for all of us. We took turns running the registers, helping as many customer's as we could, and trying to get as much merchandise out of the store asap. The most difficult and tiresome part of all of this is dealing with the customer's. Their reactions to hearing about the store's closing ranged from disbelief, confusion, annoyance, anger, and panic. You would think that the world was ending by the way they responded to the news. We tried to explain to them as much as we understood ourselves (we all had little scripts to read to them, disclosing very little information), but they still pressed on wanting to know why. The most memorable experience I had was during the last week of the closing. The store was closed to customers, and we were putting things palettes and wrapping things up. The store was very empty, and we knew our time was winding down together. So we decided to all stop what we were doing, and stood in a circle and played catch with a tennis ball we found on the ground.  We just tossed it among each other, and what seemed like a simple thing was actually the best experience we had throughout the whole treacherous process. It was a time that we actually just stopped and enjoyed each other's company, laughed, and shared stories about the past time's we had in the store. Our manager's didn't yell at us our make us stop.

My job that I worked for ten years closed it's doors for good. I worked at the store since it's opening, so basically, I've was there from birth to death. There were no warnings or signs that it would close, the news came at quite a shock. I'll never forget the day my manager pulled me aside and told me the shocking news. I was in a state of disbelief. I knew that from that point on everything will change. I started out as a regular sales associate. I moved my way up the ranks over the years. I worked very hard to get to the position that I was at, but deep down, I wanted to leave and change careers. I've been internally battling on whether to stay or go. I've gotten so used to working there, my coworkers, and the familiar faces of the customers. However, I knew it was time to move on, I just needed a push to do it. I feel like everything happens for a reason, and maybe this was some higher power forcing me to move on. The experience was very new to me. I've never been through a store closing and liquidation before. It's an experience that I'll never forget. You try to stay positive in this bittersweet moment. It's a weird feeling watching day-by-day, the physical look of the store change. It gets emptier and emptier. Products are being marked down to prices as low as you've ever seen.

I usually wake up for work around 7 AM but today I was awoken by the sound of someone sobbing hysterically. It was my brother. My  brother suffers from chronic depression and is believed to  be bipolar. I could already tell  my brother was going  to have a  manic episode that day. So i thought i would take a shower early before he was able to lock me  into  a conversation and i  would have to speak to my  brother and look into the eyes of a brother i had lost years ago. In order to understand my situation, as the reader you have to understand that his manic episodes come in packages; Anger, Sadness and euphoria. I wasnt sure what emotion was  going to come out tooday so i decided to get in the  shower. As im getting  in the shower the dooor knob starts to rattle. I immediately know its my  brother but i act like i dont know who  it is. ""hello!?"" i call out. The doorknob begins to rattle even more viciously than before. i call out once more and bang the door ""HELLO!?"". As i open the door because the rattling wont stop its my brother, or is a shell of what he once was. He is unshaven, 100 lbs overweight and smells and looks like he hasnt showered in a week. I tell him  ""dude what the fuck?"" but he just stares at me and doesnt say a word. after about 10 seconds of awkward silence he says  ""im going to work today fucker"" and leaves me with an manical smille. My parents left that day for vegas for vacation. The next couple of days are some of the most horrifying days of my life.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,,0.0,retold

He suffers manic episodes that can be sad,happy or angry episodes. When this happens he goes to my parents house (where i live) and caused infrastructure and mental destruction. It depends on the epsiode but most of the time  it involves yelling and screaming that is very frightening.  The  scariest day I can write about was the day that my  parents were leaving for vacation to vegas, They were only going to spend the weekend. Unfortunately, the weeks leading up to the vacation were a bad couple of weeks mentally for my brother. The fact that my parents were leaving Miami disturbed him and he was causing all sorts of trouble  leading up to the vacation like Arguments, Fights at the house, mean text messages. Before my parents  left my father told me I would be in charge of the family business while hes gone. We manufacture vacuum pump trucks so its  not an  easy  job, there's a lot of heavy machinery  involved, so i was anxious myself  because I had been handed a big task. Its the day that my parents are leaving  for vacation and I'm fast asleep waiting for my 7:30 alarm in slumber. As I'm dreaming I begin to hear something in  my trance like state and start  slowing awakening to Traumatic sobbing from the terrace of the  house and at this point I'm not sure if im still dreaming or some weird sound is coming from the outside. As i  awaken more I notice its my brother hysterically crying while my dad hugs Him. Its very strange that hes showing up  at 5am because he never does this. His crying was the first stage of his manic episode. I dont like to see him  like this so i often avoid speaking to him when hes in his very sobbing and depressed state. So i  tell myself I'll go ahead and  take a shower so maybe he wont see me. I'm very spooked, You have to understand that his manic episodes that start  with depression are by far the worst, It lasts longer, days. I get Into the shower and as I'm taking off my clothes I hear the door to the bathroom start rattling around like someone is forcefully trying open the door. I yell ""Hello?!?!"" but theres no response. Shortly after the rattling begins again but  more aggressively. I had to  cut the story in half for part 1  - True Story - It gets much  worse. -  let me know if you want the rest.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,0.0,recalled

My mom told me that bath time was always my favorite time because I would swim around in the bathtub and that's why she decided to put me into swimming. I was 8 years old when I had my first swim meet and I can remember it clear as day even though it happened over a decade ago. I remember diving into the pool and swimming as fast as I could and even taking peeks at the lanes on either side of me to see how I was doing overall. When I touched the wall at the end I thought I had lost and the first thing I told my mother when I got out of the pool was that I sucked. My coach reassured me that I was better than I thought and shortly thereafter I was bumped up into the bigger pool where all the 'big kids' practiced. I would go on to swim for this team for 10 years during the summer. When I started my freshman year of high school I tried out for my high school swim team and made it and then around the same time I joined a club team so I was swimming pretty much the entire year with not many breaks in between. When I was a senior in high school I was given the opportunity to go to schools on a scholarship for swimming but I decided to go to a school that I really wanted to go to even though they hadn't offered me a scholarship, but I was allowed to try out as a walk-on. When I started my freshman year of college, however, I changed my mind. I just felt like I couldn't do another four years and I really needed a break and I didn't want my college experience to be consumed by swimming so decided not to try out for the team. It was a really hard decision and I felt guilty. It was eating away at my subconscious and I would always have nightmares and I felt like I was punishing myself. It took a long time but I finally got the courage to get back in the water. Swimming is pretty much all I've really known so when I got back in the water it just felt right and I've been doing it ever since.",33OOO72IVI70S9NCDVGJG33WSCACT6,,0.0,retold

It had been about five years since I had last been a pool. Since I was about 8 years old I had been swimming competitively over the summer at my neighborhood pool, from there I swam for my high school team, and then around the same time I began swimming for a club team. Between morning practices before school and then practices after school as well as the occasional swim meets that took place throughout the week my schedule was booked. I would go to my club practices every Saturday meaning essentially I got one day off every week which was Sunday. When the season was up for high school swimming I would go on to continue swimming for my club and then during the summer I would do both club and swim for my neighborhood swim team. Swimming was my life. It was all I had known since I was 8 years old and when I was 18 I had to make the painful choice about whether or not I wanted to continue swimming in college. I ended up choosing having a social life over swimming to a lot of people's dismay. Towards the end of my high school career I was emotionally and physically drained and I felt like I just needed a break. So I went on to have a normal college life with no swimming involved. It was difficult. The guilt definitely took a toll on my subconscious. I would have dreams all the time about getting back into the pool and I wondered if I had made a mistake.

Like i said shes my daughter and i just wanted her to be happy. i said i think it would be a good idea if we met this young lady and got to know her. She started crying and threw herself into my arms. Said she wasn't sure what to think because of the way everyone behaves towards people like her in the news. i told her to ignore those people they were just ignorant and that her life doesn't hurt anyone else.

My dad had been complaining about feeling different and he had symptoms of the flu. He thought that if he just stayed home from work and rested up a bit he would be up and feeling better in no time. He was starting to feel better the Monday before everything went down, but he was not completely himself at that moment either. I went to work that day just like I normally do, but around two in the afternoon I got a call from my mom saying that she was taking my dad to the hospital because he was unable to remember things that were happening and things that he always remembered. I told her that since the school day was almost over I would finish out the day and then I would head to the hospital afterwards if they were still there. I finished the day out at work and immediately left school to head to the hospital because my mom said that we all needed to be there as soon as possible to talk about some things. When I got to the hospital I was taken up to the ICU, which was strange to me for someone that seemed to only be suffering from the flu. When I walked into my dad's room I was terrified. He had never looked as weak and out of it as he had that day. He didn't even know who I was. My mom had been crying I could tell, but  she didn't want to talk in front of my dad, so we all went in the hallway. When we got out of the room my mom completely fell apart and told us that my dad was suffering kidney failure. I was astounded because he never showed any signs of this before and was never told anything about this at doctor appointments. He was given 3 weeks to live. I was so scared and sad and I didn't know how to react, but only to believe that this couldn't be true. The next day my family and I spent the entire day hanging out with my dad in the hospital, although he was totally out of it by this point. I remember that day before we headed home for the night telling my dad that I would see him tomorrow and that I loved him very much. That would be the last time I ever saw my dad. He passed away in his sleep at the age of 56. I am still devastated to this day that this happened and I will forever question why this happened to him.",33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,,0.0,retold

My life will be forever changed. My dad had been sick with what everyone thought was the flu. He was throwing up and complaining of being very tired and hot. He didn't even have a fever. He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. When the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. Finally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated and from that moment on our lives had changed forever.",33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,0.0,recalled

We hit it off well and got close quickly, but it soon became very clear that he doesn't have any time for me in his life. I talked to him about how I was feeling and he tried to understand and do what he could, but ultimately there was just no way forward. After not barely hearing from him for a couple days, I messaged him to tell him that I wanted to make it work and I tried, but it was clear that it wasn't possible and I couldn't be his girlfriend. He agreed that there was nothing he could do to change his situation and how it related to me and our potential together and that it made sense to end it. Although I wasn't expecting anything different, it hurt a lot that I could see he hadn't actually put any effort in, other than deciding to tell me he loves me, and that he so easily let go of the possibility of having any future. He was the one who insisted we try to be together, despite the obvious challenges. I feel even more like he doesn't care about my feelings or find them valid, because I told him I was concerned we weren't on the same page since the very beginning, and he insisted we were. I cried in the bathroom at work until I could finally pull myself back together. Meanwhile, he decided that the idea that we would be friends instead should start right away and sent me several messages complaining about his job. I had to tell him that I'm sorry he's frustrated at work and I care for him, it seemed really tone deaf at the moment and that I needed a beat before I could swoop into the role of providing him with emotional labor while getting nothing in return. I mean. I didn't say it in those words, but that's how I felt and it's just a new level of pain, because did he actually ever care, or did he just like someone caring about him? I feel like this is just another example of the fact that I will never meet anyone and I will spend the rest of my life alone. This was the best anything I've found in three years, I don't feel good about the future.",340UGXU9DZNBRV814H1YBRDNZFUUVE,,0.0,recalled

Now down to less than 20 carbs per day. I have also lost 40 pounds. Since we both eat so much healthier now and a lot of junk food isn't around in the house to snack on.  I never would have thought that he could be so stern with himself and stay on track with what he ate before. I am glad that he has surprised me with sticking to it.

My partner has always been a picky eater and only seemed to like to eat what I consider crap. After the diagnosis, it was devastating to him, but made me feel like we might be able to get on the same page with our diets. Or, at the very least, it would help prolong his life.    Unknown to me, the day my partner was diagnosed, he made peace with the idea that he would no longer be able to eat like a teenager. He swore off sugar and carbs and began looking for alternatives. I, on the other hand, was dreading telling him about all the things he could no longer eat and thought we would be arguing about meal time from now to eternity. For all the years we have been together, he had never expressed anything except disgust at any meal that was not deep fired or coated in sugar. I was prepared to go to battle.   When it came to buying groceries, I had a battle plan in mind. I was going to ease him into the sugar alternatives and try and introduce vegetables and meatless meals slowly so as to not upset him.  He surprised me by being the one to go straight to the Splenda and the produce aisles at the grocery store. I began seeing things like berries and whole wheat oatmeal in our cabinets. I noticed the lack of cookies, candy and frozen snacks in the house. It happened so quickly that it took me by surprise. I found myself proud of his food choices and wondering how he had the willpower to break the life long habits of the past.    About two months after the diagnosis, we had a talk. I asked him how he was able to make these drastic changes in such a short amount of time, and did he think he could keep it up. He explained to me that after the diagnosis, he became scared. He read that you could loose your eyesight to Type 2 diabetes and he didn't want that to happen.  He also explained that he had finally taken to heart that his diet upset me and he wanted to live longer for me and our relationship. I was so touched, and proud of him for being able to do something that I thought he would never be able to do.    Today, our lives are quite different than before. We eat sensible meals, we incorporate meatless alternatives into our diets and we haven't purchased sugar in over three months. My partner has lost sixty four pounds so far and we don't argue about meal time anymore, we both feel so much healthier.",345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL46673UG,345LHZDEDYERFM6IK7VSSWL46673UG,0.0,recalled

Thought it to be one of the congratulatory calls, I casually went to receive it. I almost screamed with merriment, when I heard an old friend Williams speaking to me!

I wasn't in anyway aware, It was a great celebration and one I can't easily forget. There were plenty of drinks,foods and cake chocolates and loads of blessings, wishes and prayers from friends and family. My friends came over,most of them with different beautiful gifts, some with drinks. I got a beautiful black dress as a gift from my boyfriend, I changed into it, had some makeup on, jewelry, and a beautiful diamond shoe. We took plenty beautiful pictures, danced, games, we really had fun. Its been a really long time I had a party, I was glad to be surprised with this particular one. I got a big frame of myself from my siblings and also a diamond ring from my partner. My boyfriend proposed to me with the diamond ring that very night, OMG!.My joy knew no bound, we partied all night. I was grateful having such great and beautiful people around to celebrate me. The event is so fresh in my heart. The decoration was colorful and beautifully arranged in the colours I love so much. I will be glad to have more birthday parties in subsequent years. My engagement will probably be the next great event I will be witnessing soon. Having people around you is a real deal.",,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QLO8WIG,0.0,recalled

She handed her to me and she got to lay on my chest. She came out basically perfect with little bruising to her head but she sure cried a lot for the first half hour!

I arrived at the hospital early, around 6am. I got checked in and got my bed. Around 8am I was visited by my OB and given pitocin to start labor. I couldn't feel it for a while. Around noon, my OB came back in and we discussed how things were progressing. It was going pretty slowly so we thought it would be a good idea to break my water. I decided to get my epidural first, since I wanted a relatively pain free birth. After the epidural was placed, I felt pretty sick. I had to be given some medicine to help raise my blood pressure and to help reduce the nausea. After a while I started to feel better. My water was broken and labor started to progress, though things were still slow. I spend most of the afternoon dozing off in between commercial breaks. I managed to watch some of The Force Awakens and one of the Avengers movies. Around 8pm I was ready to start pushing. I was worried about this part because it was where I had trouble with my first child. I was already tired from laboring all day and from not having any food to eat. I pushed for a couple hours and was so close but was having the same problem that I had the first time. Baby's heart rate was starting to drop with each push so about 20 minutes before 11pm my doctor decided to use the vacuum to extract my daughter. With one push, she was out. The delivery went better than my first. I was able to hold my daughter right after the delivery. She was much bigger than the scanning ultrasound said she would be. She had a great apgar score and cried for about half an hour straight after the delivery.",34MAJL3QP59SYOC3514AFSNA6P843A,,0.0,retold

I also am in charge of letting people know when they are late and have delinquent accounts.  Sometimes they get very upset with me.  Part of my job is filing liens on the people who do not pay and do not contact us.

I called him immediately and he wanted to me to send him my information.  He said he thought I would be perfect for the job.  I met with him the next week and was offered the job.  I was so happy.

She has very sick and moved from Chicago to Boulder in order to live a more comfortable life. The first full day were were in Colorado we were taken to the Rocky Mountain National Park. Unlike the typical park in a city setting, this was a huge, and I mean huge area, covering a vast majority of the Rocky Mountain range. My wife's aunt was able to come with, using her scooter, so it was nice spending our day with her also. She had only been to the lower portion of the park, so we were determined to get her to the top-most visitor's center in the park. After an hour and a half or so, we finally made it. We were able to buy some souvenirs and eat a nice lunch with my wife's cousin and aunt. It was a great lunch, and was the closest I had been to nature in a long, long time. After the long drive back, my wife, daughter, and I went white water rafting! None of us had done anything like that before, so it was quite exciting. My daughter and I sat in the front of the raft, with my wife sitting behind my daughter. No sooner had we left the shore, my wife fell in! She was ""rescued"" but soured for the rest of the ride. We kept her spirits up and we powered through nice category IV and category V rapids! She made it the rest of the way and although she was a trooper after having fallen in, she vowed never, ever, to do anything even close to resembling that again. After we finished, we were bused back to our start point, drove back to my wife's cousin's house and went to bed after a very long, exhausting, yet fulfilling day.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI,,0.0,retold

It was truly an awe inspiring trip. We drove through twisting roads, climbing ever higher, until we finally reached a height of over 11,000 feet. During the trip we were able to pull over at a number of spots to take photos of the breathtaking scenery. In Boulder, at the base of the Rocky Mountains, it was nearly 95 degrees, but at elevation the temperature was in the low 40s, which was quite shocking when climbing out of our SUV to take photos. Just before we arrived at the highest gift shop/restaurant it began to rain quite hard, then changed to sleet as we ran for cover. It was quite different from the 95 degree heat we had left only an hour and a half earlier. Looking around at the snow capped mountains, some snow only a few dozen feet from where we were standing, demonstrated the ecological diversity that one can experience without having to leave the United States. It was truly amazing eating lunch with my family and looking out at the snow on the Rocky Mountains. We were able to get our fill of souvenirs which we stock up on every vacation so we can easily remember the places we've been and the things we did. Later in the day, after the long drive down from the national park, we took our chances with white water rafting. Our family had never been rafting before, let alone in rapids. We had a spectacular time. While the air temperature at river level was still in the 90s, the cold water felt refreshing with every rapid. Being at one with nature and being able to spend an entire day experiencing some of the best that nature has to offer made me incredibly grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy it with my family.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN7B2YNI,0.0,recalled

We had her come over to our house where it is legal to shoot off fireworks and basically celebrate however you decide to do that.  We started off the day by cooking up some food and having a nice cookout on this day. We had some burgers and some typical 4th of July foods. We spent the day together as a family really just having a nice time together talking and catching up. Then it started to get darker outside and we began to shoot off some fireworks. All of our neighbors also take part in this as there really is a fireworks show right above our house.  We took her outside and at first she acted a bit scared because of all the noise. After a little bit though she relaxed and began to enjoy seeing all of the lights in the sky and hearing the noise. She was really having a great time seeing all of these things for the very first time and it reminded me how much something like this can mean. It took me back and made me enjoy the 4th more than I have in a long time. I really enjoyed watching how she reacted to each huge firework that exploded in the sky above her head. She was throwing her hands in the air and screaming in joy about how much fun she was having with all of this. We really had a great time on this 4th showing this little girl what this holiday was all about. She had a great experience with the entire thing and really enjoyed her first one. She couldn't stop smiling as she was having the time of her life during this event.,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YLNY1,,0.0,retold

Well this summer I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed so we had a nice family get together at my house for the holiday. During this day we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her having a really great time on her first 4th of July. Then the night started to roll in upon us and where I love we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another. I watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her. We continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process.

This was also the place where we held our wedding ceremony and reception. It felt more special than any other wedding because it was mine and I was surrounded by the people who mattered most to not only me but my husband. We had the ceremony in the backyard of the ranch, overlooking the mountains next to us. We could hear the river flowing below us as we recited our vows we wrote to each other. I will never forget seeing my husband’s face when I walked to him down the aisle. I knew I was marrying the right man when I took the tears from his eyes. The most magical part of the wedding was after our ceremony. We just barely had enough time to finish family photos before it started to rain over the mountains. We all ran inside and then to the pavilion. I remember standing there looking at the rain coming over the mountains and I was in awe. Standing there with my family and friends and new husband meant the world to me because I had just started the new chapter of my life and I had them all with me. The rain was breathtaking. I knew the rain signified that our relationship would last through anything and I constantly look back at that moment as my favorite. We had spent months and years planning this wedding and it was definitely the most significant aspect of my life to date.

She has been diagnosed with cancer and has not been responding to treatment well. Recently she has decided to stop with chemo and radiation because she doesn't want to spend the last few weeks of her life sick. It was a very hard decision for her to make, and for her family to accept. After she decided this, she came into the office and we talked about what we could do for her. When she was in she handed me a card and a small porcelain angel. She held my hand and told me she thought I was angel sent from heaven to help her during such an awful time. She said I gave her so much kindness and love, and that I felt more like family to her than a nurse. I felt my heart break into pieces, but also I felt so loved and appreciated. This woman was going through such a terrible time, and she wanted to comfort me. I hugged her and told her she was my family too, and that I love her very much.

We where all getting ready having a good time together when we noticed that one of the guys in the party was missing. It started to get closer and closer to the time we need together to start the ceremony. We had some people looking for him. After hours of searching he was finally found later in a closet passed out from drinking too much. This was really bad and we knew that it wouldnt be a good thing for him to be in it. I think all of us where disappointed in him. Although this may have been the case we realized that things happen. We ended up going on with the ceremony and just letting it be. We had a great night and everyone was happy and content with the way it went. This doesn't define the person and I know I realize that but I also hope everyone else did.

My brother and I have been close since I can remember. Life has lead us in different directions and caused us to distant because of his relocation for work. I still feel like he is one of the only people who know me best. So when he asked me to be the best man in his wedding, I was honored. We all gathered before hand, the wedding party just the groom and groomsmen because of the bad luck seeing your spouse and all. We where getting ready and chatting when we suddenly realized one of the groomsman who was one of my brothers friends was not with us. One at time we started calling him on his cell phone. We called and called for around a half hour. The wedding was going to begin in about another hour and a half. We decided to go looking for my brothers friend/groomsmen because we had seen him earlier that day. In fact he was with us when entered the facility the wedding was taking place at. We decided that maybe his phone was dead and we should go search for him. So me and cousin who was also a groomsmen went to look for him. We looked and looked but didnt have any luck. After half an hour we went back to tell my brother we couldnt find him. With about an hour left until wedding things became panicky. About 20 minutes later of chaos and panic we got a call from housekeeping. My brothers friend who is almost 30 years old was passed out drunk in the closet where they keep extra chairs and tables. After he was confronted he began to cry about his drinking problem. This lead to a quick chat about him and who he was and what he needed to do. We didnt have him in the wedding and just went with an uneven number of groomsmen and bridesmaid's. I havent heard from my brothers friend in awhile nor about him but it was very eye opening. It made me realize how fortunate I am to be free of an addiction. He wasnt someone you would expect to go through something like this and I hope he gets better.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254QU8JQ3,,0.0,recalled

The decor was absolutely amazing. During the ceremony, they had flower petals lining the aisles. The procession started with my friend, the groom, and his parents. He looked amazing in a navy blue tuxedo with a light pink tie. It was very classy. After the bridesmaids and groomsmen walked down the aisle, it was time for the bride and her father to enter. Everyone stood up and turned their heads as the bride walked into the hall. She was absolutely beautiful; stunning from head to toe. Her dress was barely touching the ground, yet her veil had a four foot train behind her. The whole ceremony only lasted about twenty minutes, and was well officiated by one of our close friends. After that, the wedding party headed to the banquet hall next door for a few drinks and appetizers. Luckily, it was open bar so I didn't have to pay for a glass of wine. An hour or so later, everyone settled into their seats as the DJ announced the new couple. They had their first dance, as well as the mother-son and father-daughter dances. Dinner came out shortly after the best man and maid of honor made their speeches. I ordered the steak, and it was cooked to perfection. After I ate, I had a couple more cocktails and that's when the real fun began. We danced for a few hours, and celebrated the new couples nuptials.

I took a lot of very nice pictures of her and him together and of there family together. I love the part of them coming out of the church. They really showed of they felt after they go married. They had a wonderful ceremony after the wedding and there was a lot of food and dancing. They don't the flower toss and they cut the cake a feed each other. she was even given a house to live it and that showed a lot of emotions to. With me telling the story I think if I could show pictures it would show you more emotions. They got to go in a old jeep and that was kind of neat seeing them leave on that jeep. They even made sure to wave at everybody and we started cleaning up once they left. This was one of the pretest wedding I have been to in a wail. They had everything perfect even though I thought we were going to be a little late with pictures. They even had this at a church with a pond. They knew exactly what they wanted and how they wanted this and so we were justing waiting on some of the grooms men. Some of them where running late and I was trying not to be unhappy but I was get scared like I wasn't having enough time to do all the pictures. This is the end of my story but like I was saying if I could show pictures I could show a whole lot more.,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T2WJQA,34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T2WJQA,0.0,recalled

It ended up being in a really beautiful place. It was in a secluded place in the mountains. I had never been to this area before, but I would like to go back. The area made me feel nostalgic for some reason. The wedding itself was small and quick. It didn't last long and the church was small but beautiful.  There were not too many people there, it was was a nice little ceremony. I wish that more people on my brothers side were there. My brothers wife had a lot of family there which is fine. The after party was nice.  There was good food that were catered. All around the people there were nice as well. I think my brother was happy so that's all that matters. I had fun at the end of the day and it was a nice experience. It kind of made me wonder if I will ever get married and where. I still think about the location and how beautiful it was.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254T3CQJZ,,0.0,retold

It was very memorable because it was a whole lot different than his first wedding. His first wedding was hard for me. I had to drive a few states over to get to it. It was close to a 15 hour drive and it was just draining. And by the time the wedding happened, I was done. This one with the new wife was much more simpler. I was closer so the drive wasnt bad. I also like the girl he was marrying this time. It was a small wedding and it was in a beautiful area. I think that is what I remember the most was the mountains surrounding everywhere. It was just a nice time and I know my brother appreciated me and other friends showing up there. The actual wedding was quick and to the point which was nice. The after party had good food and it was a nice and peaceful time. It was also in the mountains which was pretty.

I was inspired by the new coach at our gym to compete much more frequently. I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random. But the lessons I learned in preparation were eye-opening. I came out of this experience a stronger person.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254ZIGJQW,,0.0,retold

It took a lot of discipline to prepare for. I had to diet and lose about 15 pounds. I trained about 6-7 days out of the week. There were at least 4 jiu jitsu training sessions and 1 judo session. In addition to this, I also traveled to other gyms to spar against other jiu jitsu players. It was grueling and I was definitely physically and emotionally exhausted, but I enjoyed every part of it. People were so nice and welcoming, and helped motivate me to push myself to work harder. By the day of the tournament, I was equal parts nervous and excited. There's a change you could lose decisively or win easily - just a matter of who shows up. Luckily, as soon as my first match started I knew I could win. It released all the tension and I performed as I normally would in practice. Afterwards, I won the tournament and felt very happy. It seemed so much easier than I thought it would be.

He had a hard time walking, he didn't have much energy, and overall he just wasn't doing good. Some days were better than others, but for the most part he was having more good days (at the time). He was 16 at the start of 2019, he would have been 17 in July 2019. I noticed around February 2019 that he wasn't eating his normal dog food, so I began looking for alternatives so he would be able to eat. I purchased various dog foods, from wet and dry and anything else I could find. Tried different meats like fish, chicken, beef and lamb. He would eat the new dog food that I purchased him for a few days and then all of a sudden stop eating it. It got to the point where I started making his own dog food in a desperate attempt to maintain his weight. But, as much as I tried, he just wouldn't eat as much as he needed to, or wouldn't eat at all. His eyesight was getting worse, to the point where he was almost completely blind. He went deaf when he was 14 years old, so it was breaking my heart watching him lose all of his senses. It was to the point where I was considering putting him down because his quality of life just wasn't there, but then he would have a good day and it would make me question myself. Not only that, I didn't want to put down my baby. He had been my best friend for 16 years and I wasn't ready to let him go. Just writing this now is making me cry. Anyway, he wasn't doing very well but he was still having a few good days here and there, but I noticed around March he was having more bad days at this point. Then, something worse happened. I don't remember if I went into detail my last diary entry, but it was bad. Blood was coming out places it shouldn't, and I knew it was time.

I know it's silly to call a dog your best friend, but he's been through everything with me. I knew his time was limited, dogs only live to be around 10-15 years old, but it was still the most difficult day of my life. Weeks prior to losing him, I could tell he was going downhill. He wasn't as excited to eat anymore, he had trouble walking, he completely lost his eyesight. It was hard, watching him go through that. I didn't know if I should be the one to put him down, or hope that maybe he would pass peacefully in his sleep one night. As time went on, I could really see him begin to go downhill. I woke up one morning and found blood in his crate, knowing something was wrong I took him to the vet. They couldn't see any cuts on him, and explained that he may be bleeding from his anus. I asked if maybe he ate something sharp, and they said it was possible but to watch him and see if he continues to do it. So I watched him, and he bled every time he went to go potty. He began to throw up after every time he ate, he didn't know where he was half the time. At one point I picked him up and he bit me, not because I had hurt him, but because he was starting to lose his mind. We knew it was time to put him down, and I hysterics. How could I go to the vets office, and not come back with him? How could I be the one to take my best friend out of this world? How could I stand there for one second and him be there with me, and the next he's gone. The day he bit me was the day I called the vets office and made the appointment, after I hung up I just sat down and cried. That night and the following morning I considered canceling the appointment, but hours before we were supposed to go in it looked like he had a seizure. I held him the entire time to make sure he didn't hurt himself, and once he was done I made him comfortable until it was time. We brought him in, and they drugged him so he was out of it. I didn't leave his side the entire time, I wasn't going to leave him alone. He had been there for me my entire life, so I was going to be there for him. I hugged him one last time while the vet injected him with two different shots, and I saw the light leave his eyes.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHI7SU,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHI7SU,0.0,recalled

Following my friend Amy's suggestion, I came into her 7th grade class to teach them about writing.  Being a people-pleaser I of course said yes when she asked a few weeks ago despite serious misgivings about my ability to do this.  I was surprised to find that I was not only successful but that I even managed to enjoy myself in front of the class by the end.  Not only that, but my friend Amy was delighted with my performance and would like me to come in again next school year.  Coming in as an authority on any topic is difficult for me because it is so ingrained in my personality to be deferential, even if it's 7th graders.  I risked humiliation in order to stand in front of the class and present what I'd prepared and it was delightful to find that everything you are is not fixed but can change.  It was extremely gratifying to succeed because I put a lot of effort into preparing myself for the task.  I'm hugely relieved that it's over but hopeful about future opportunities.  It's a good reminder to me that challenging myself reaps rewards and that we are all capable of more than just what we have done in the past.  I come away from this experience as less of a defeatist.  I'm more hopeful about the future and what I might do with my time and talent, especially as all of my kids reach school-age in just a few years.  In this moment I'm exhausted from the preparation and execution of this task but I intend to repeat the exercise in the future.  I assumed that my English Literature degree would forever be useless but now I believe there was a good reason for it.  Now it remains to persevere and continue to challenge myself to repeat a nerve-wracking task.  In the future I will at least have the memory that today at least I succeeded, I was surprising and know that not everything about me is fixed.",3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,,0.0,retold

I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.  I hope that I will not fail.",3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,3570Y55XZQ59Q72BPNZ1EBGQ6ZGGYS,0.0,recalled

There was a lot of food at the fishing derby, hot dogs, burgers, macaroni salads, and much more, and I loved eating all of it. I might have even eaten too much during the event because I got a stomachache afterwards. But then I had to make room for dessert and I just couldn't resist the temptation of some amazing cake, even though I regretted the overfull feeling I felt later, if only a bit. Lots of my family members whom I don't get to see very often were there at the derby and I got to talk to them. I talked to my aunts and uncles and cousins and their kids, and it was nice being able to catch up with them. Some of my nieces and nephews had grown up a lot since the last time I had seen them, some were entering high school and others weren't little infants anymore, and were toddling and running about everywhere around the stock pond. There was a fishing contest for all the kids, which is why the event was called a fishing derby, where they all would fish and catch frogs from my aunt's stock pond. I didn't participate in the derby games because I'm a bit too old to do that anymore. Perhaps maybe my lack of participation in the contests might have just been because I don't really like how slimy fish and frogs feel in my hands. The kids all had some other contests for them to compete in as well, and I watched from the sidelines with the adults. During the frog race, the kids all picked one caught frog, and had to coax them to hop across a finish line the fastest. But a surprising thing happened during the frog race, one of the kids accidentally coaxed their frog to jump onto me and I might have panicked reflexively. But on the other hand I ended up kicking out my foot and flinging the frog over the finish line, making my little cousin the winner of that round. It was a fun event, with lots of laughs and a bunch of good memories for me.",35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS21XAVZ5,,0.0,retold

I had been invited about a week prior and I had been very excited to go to the event. The event was a Family Fishing derby being held for family and family friends at one of my aunt's fishing stock ponds near her house. It was a potluck type event, but there was plenty of good food to be had like hotdogs, burgers, and macaroni salad. I ate a lot more than I anticipated and gave myself a bit of a stomachache but I still don't regret it either because I enjoyed it all. Along with the fishing contest there were other activities like frog catching with nets, with prizes for catching the biggest frog or fish. After that was the annual picture with all the kids and young adults who hadn't reached thirty yet, I was in that photo too. Then after we did that we watched the littler kids all participate in the frog race, where on a sheet they would race the captured frogs to win other prizes. I didn't participate in the games because I had already outgrown the age range of the kids participating. It was fun just watching the kids and teens have fun though, and I got to eat more while I watched. I indulged myself in dessert and talking to some of the family members I didn't usually get many chances to see casually. Also I nearly had a frog jump on me during the frog race for the kids. While I like frogs, I don't like slimy feels so I jumped back a bit when the kids were releasing all the caught frogs back into the pond. At the end of the event we all got commemorative coins for the event that my aunt had specially prepared for the occasion and I was happy to get one. Before I left the event to go home, I picked some wild apples from an apple tree near the road entrance on my aunt's property with my mom, who'd attended the event with me. I think I'll remember the family fishing derby that occurred this year very fondly for years to come.",35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS21XAVZ5,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS21XAVZ5,0.0,recalled

When in Boulder we visited a new brewery, Fall Brewing. We also visited a Brewery we had been to before, Avery. On our way back from Boulder we visited Liquid Mechanics. We visited a total of five breweries the first night in town, which included two in Denver on the way back from Boulder. We were out all day and stayed about an hour at each location. Later that night we met one of his friends. This friend moved from California to Colorado for work. We met the friend at a hockey rink he plays at. We met him there with his wife and some of his friends. While we were there we ordered beers and caught up. I became interested in showing off the excel sheet I created.

This was the third time in three years that we've made this trip. We go there to watch hockey games, to hang out with our friends that have moved there, and to drink craft beer, as this is a hobby of ours. I am the planner, and am comfortable planning things for us because my boyfriend doesn't care about what we do one way or another. This year I let him know I was planning for us to visit a total 19 different breweries and worked out when could do each thing I wanted. One of the things we had to figure out when we would be hitting up all the breweries I wanted to visit in Boulder. We had to plan this carefully because some days were just out of the question - there were two days we needed to be in Denver for because we would be attending hockey games, and we wanted to be in Denver on the last day we were leaving instead of going to the airport from Boulder. In the end, everything worked out. We went to Boulder the day we got into town. We got to see his friend that moved up there. I got to spend some one-on-one time at brunch with my friend while my boyfriend slept in at the hotel. We got to see hockey games. We visited a cat cafe on our final day in town and brought them some toys that I had ordered and shipped to an Amazon Locker. My boyfriend got some advice from brewers, as he was seeking to brew his own beer. We even got to visit some places that weren't on the list because I didn't schedule any restaurants for us to visit while we were there. Every day was rewarding because we had an itinerary, a purpose for visiting each brewery, and because I focused on location and hours of operation of each of those places and planned accordingly. The only thing we didn't get to do - again - was visit the Denver Mint. He had been wanting to go since the first year we went. Maybe next year.",35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z9UVZB,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2Z9UVZB,0.0,recalled

I was driving down the road and I remember just being very sleepy and I was having a hard time staying awake. The next thing I knew I was looking down at a pool of blood that had apparently come from my head. I had been in an accident with another vehicle. I had blacked out and ran head on into this other person. I was taken to the hospital by helicopter because this was an emergency situation. I spent months in the hospital because of this accident and I had to go through rehabilitation to walk right again. While I was in the hospital I was asked many questions and many tests were done to me. After having gone through all of this I was diagnosed with Sleep Apnea. Sleep Apnea serious sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. This causes you to not get good sleep. This may have also caused the accident. I didn't know my sleep was not going well and since I was sleepy I blacked out while sleeping and caused the accident. Having done this to myself and another person has made me feel awful. If I had just looked into this sooner perhaps this may have never happened. I promise that from now on I will take my health more seriously. My life and the life of others is at stake.,,35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K82E8X34,0.0,imagined

However, I still think about that big hit that she had during an important game. I was so proud of her and I could tell she was proud of herself. Her team was down by two runs and it was her turn to bat. As a parent I was nervous and excited. I didn't want her to fail and this could be a good confidence boost. She walked to the plate while her favorite song played Motley Crue ""Girls, Girls, Girls"" and took her position. For the record, her best friends grandpa is Mick Mars from that legendary rock band and she picked it. Anyway, while up at bat she had a couple of strikes and a ball before she finally got a piece of the ball. She hit the sweet spot on the bat and the ball soared into the outfield. She was able to make a double and a RBI to win the game for her team. She was so proud of herself and I was too. I don't think she knew that she was capable of getting a big hit. It was a defining moment for her and something I still think about. I am hoping she will want ot play softball again next year.",35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8S1O3XQ,,0.0,retold

The double was a huge deal for her. She knew that she hit the sweet spot on the bat because she could hear the familiar sound. She was at a 3-2 count so anything could have happen. She could have let her nerves wear her down and just strike out. However, she was patient and focused. She was able to harness her potential and made a big play for her team. She immediately ran to first base and then second with seconds to spare. A runner was able to make it home and score. We were ahead with two out and my daughter on second.

She proceeded to explain to me that it doesn't mean anything good. there's something wrong with my dog. Her lymph nodes are working hard and that's why they are so enlarged.  She suggested I get a find needle aspiration done to her lymph node to have it tested right away.  I had to wait a few days only to find out it was inconclusive.  I had to bring her back in for minor surgery so they could pull a piece of lymph node out and test the tissue.  One full week later and a lot of worry and sleepless nights I get a call. she's not sick.  She doesn't have cancer. She has a rare deformity that even the vets can't even explain fully.

I'm so incredibly happy for her and her new HUSBAND Henry. It was a beautiful wedding. I felt responsible as a bridesmaid and as a sister for everything to go smoothly. I tried to make sure that Clara didn't have to deal with everything and could just enjoy her day. First, Mom was so fussy. She wanted things to go perfectly for the guests, but I just wanted the couple to be happy. The the wedding officiator not coming until the last minute was worrisome. But we were surrounded by people who love us, so really if we didn't have the officiator until late, it wouldn't mean that things were SO BAD. But by the way Mom was acting, you'd think the world was ending. Henry and Clara love each other, we are here to celebrate, and it was beautiful. I wish people didn't get so stressed about weddings. When I get married, I hope it's relaxed and everyone is happy and not stressed. The speech I labored over went over extremely well! People laughed and cried, and I felt closer than ever to my little sister. I loved the wedding.

I have no children of my own, so it wasn't as impactful on me as it was my brother who is her father, but it still got me pretty emotional.

I am dating someone right now, so I could only think about the children we could possibly have. Would we be ready for parenthood? It was also a fun experience because a lot of family was there. We all talked about what was going on in our lives and each other's children, minus me, and what they're all up to. It was also kind of a scary moment. With all that is going on the world, it seems irresponsible to bring children into what is going on. One can only hope they will grow up unscathed by anything traumatic.

There were a few different things that went wrong with the project, but ultimately the project was accomplished completely.  We initially thought the well was not producing the right amount of water.  We checked the water flow meter regularly, and saw it was only pumping about 100 gallons each week.  I emailed the team who installed the pump to ask about this.  We were supposed to be pumping upwards of 10,000 gallons each week, so this was very low.  I also emailed the consultant to confirm his projections were still accurate.  The two were able to meet on site together, and I learned that we had been reading the wrong meter the whole time.  The meter we had been reading was the water we were using from the local water source, not our pump.  Our pump meter was somewhere else on site, and it turned out we were pumping almost the exact amount.  I was able to relay this information to my boss all throughout so everyone was kept informed and didn't stress.  The important lesson here was to keep everyone updated and stay organized, and always move things forward.  I can see how something like this could cause stress in someone's life.  It's never easy to feel like you failed at work.  Fortunately, my past work experiences had prepared me to prepare.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45U9PP6NJ,,0.0,retold

I recently completed  a project at work that did not go as planned.  Before I started working for the company as a project coordinator, my boss had coordinated a fundraising effort to raise money for a well to be built on campus.  The well was supposed to yield 3600 gallons of water every week.  We had a biologist come out to see the land and confirm this amount.  I was brought on to help finish the project.  I felt a little uneasy about managing a project that was going to cost the company so much money, but I was glad to know my boss was looking forward to this.  I would have been more nervous if I had to make the final decisions, but basically everything had already been predetermined for me; who were we going to hire, how it was going to get done, etc.  I felt like I did a very good job keeping all the pieces moving.  I didn't rush anyone, but through good communication, asking for updates, frequent reminders, and a smiling face, the project got done on time and under budget!  I don't think I cut any corners.  But the well is not producing 3600 gallons every week.  It's only producing 300 gallons, nearly a tenth of what we'd been told.  I don't think this is my fault, but I am now trying to figure out a reasonable explanation so my boss is not surprised.  It just goes to show once again that it's important to manage expectations.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45U9PP6NJ,35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45U9PP6NJ,0.0,recalled

My nephew was graduating from high school and we wanted to celebrate. The first thing that we did was take him to his favorite restaurant for lunch. We all sat down and enjoyed a great sushi layout. His favorite fish is yellowtail, so in addition to the variety of different fish, we made sure to get him yellowtail rolls, spicy yellowtail rolls, and yellowtail/salmon rolls, which is his favorite. The restaurant also had cooked food as well so for the ones that didn't want raw fish, they had the chance to order other things. But he really enjoyed the sushi. I, myself, had the spicy roll combination. My wife had the sashami combination. After that we went to the movie theater to watch a movie together. Then we went to the golf course to play some mini golf, which is what his sister likes. We always try to make sure all the family members are involved in some way or another. Then after that he had a graduation party with his friends, where one of the highlights (for them anyway) was to light up a bonfire and burn all their notes from their senior year. It was also a bittersweet time because it was going to be the last time they would all gather together. Most of them were going to different colleges and universities so it would be harder in the future to all get together.",369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V4G6K,,0.0,retold

He graduated from high school in June of 2019 and I was so proud because he is going to Princeton for college. He worked hard and was able to make it there through a combination of decent grades, a very good score on the SAT as well as working part-time for his father's business. He took the SATs twice. The first time he didn't do so well and scored a 1250. However the second time, he made a conscious effort to work on the weaknesses that he remembered and improved his score to a 1400. He is also an intern for his father's company, which is in the real estate business. He did the various odd jobs there where he cleaned up, made sure the pantry and other areas were well stocked and helped to input data into the company's systems. Part of the money that he saved was used to start up an IRA account. I work as a financial analyst and tried to show him what would happen if he used the power of compounding interest and how large he could grow his nest egg if he had 40+ years to invest. He ended up opening the account and buying 25 shares of Disney. When he graduated, we first went to a nice dinner at our local favorite Italian restaurant where he had his favorite meal, lasagna with a side of creamed spinach. After that we went to a movie. After that we went back home where we relaxed, played some board games and shared stories about the time that we went to college. It was, all in all, a very fun night.",369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V4G6K,369J354OFEW77NS5J449VKWX6V4G6K,0.0,recalled

We weren't planning far out for it to happen, but opportunities just lined up so all four of us took a month off of work to take this trip. Tickets were booked. Plans were made. We scheduled family trips with our extended families in Korea. One of the parts of our trip that I was looking forward to the most was just driving down the coast of Korea in a rented car. In retrospect, that was one of my favorite parts of the trip. We stopped at resturants that we thought looked good. We just observed the landscape and went with no serious schedule. It felt good to not have to worry about work and just enjoy the weather and the views. Everything was interesting to see. We took a lot of pictures and we have them playing in a digital album in our dining room. It is fun seeing all the food that we ate and things that we saw.

She was stressed because her children were being bad and you could tell that she just wanted to get out of there without losing her mind. She's putting all the items in the checkout lane while her kids are grabbing items from the shelves and just making her life harder. She finally has everything under control and she goes to pay for the food. Suddenly her card says that it was declined. She tried several other cards in what seemed like an eternity. She knew that she was holding up the line and her kids were starting to act up again and I could see she was about to break down. As the tears start running down her cheeks, the cashier takes out his wallet and says it's fine I'll take care of it.

It was a cold day and it seemed like the weather was effecting the moods of the other shoppers. People were rude, they were bumping into me at the store and not even taking the time to say excuse me. As I collected my necessities for the week and I went to the check out line I noticed a young women and her two children. She was about 25 or so and her children could not have been more than a few years old each. She was young but had the weathered look of someone who was struggling a bit. Her kids were driving her crazy and I could tell she just wanted to get home. Anyways as she is going to pay she sticks her credit card into the machine and it's declined. She tries another card and it's the same result. Again and again for what seemed like an eternity. This lady with her two kids and a cart full of groceries was holding up the line and I could tell things were going to come to a head. She finally breaks down and starts weeping. I felt so terrible but as I'm on a budget I was not in the position to help. Finally after about a minute the cashier swipes his card and says ""don't worry mam, I know how it feels like to struggle."" There had to be at least a hundred or so dollars worth of groceries and I'm sure this cashier wasn't getting paid much more than $10 an hour. To take your days pay and to help out a stranger was one of the most touching things I've seen. She gave this cashier a big hug and she went about her day. I felt good about the human race for the entire day after that.",36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4L4IOJO,36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4L4IOJO,0.0,recalled

This year we managed to convince a new friend to go with us on top of our usual group. We traveled there during the middle of the day and were lucky enough to not have to deal with any snow this year. The previous year was quite snowy when we were driving up. We also managed to get lucky and get a room with a balcony again. We try our best to get one every year but since so many people are going it's often tricky to not find them all booked already. The balcony adds a really nice relaxing place to hang out where you can still see some of the event while taking a break up at your room, it really adds to the experience. The event has a 24-hour arcade that runs every day and we have found over the years that it's best to be up and night and sleep during the day. That way you get to enjoy the arcade with less people and can sleep when everything is super crowded. This year especially I mostly focused on the arcade so I was asleep a lot during the day and just stayed up all night. You also have to be careful about where you get food and when because of how busy everything is. Typically we get a bunch of snacks and things for our room to have something as filler since we aren't sure when we might manage to eat. We also try to make at least one trip to a nearby steak place every year we go, as well as a trip to the local Chinese food place. We did our best to teach our new attending friend our tricks but we mostly let him enjoy whatever he wanted to do and he ended up liking the event a lot which is good. I believe he managed to get something signed by a composer he likes. I hope he comes again next year and we can have another addition to our yearly crew. Overall it was a great time and I look forward to going again early next year. This is so far the main thing I do reliably every year so I hope we get to keep doing it. Hopefully we get lucky with the balcony room again and manage to not have it be too cold or snowy during the event itself.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6,,0.0,retold

It's a convention we go to every year but this year a new friend decided to come with us and we were able to introduce him to the experience we have every year. It's a convention with music and lots of arcade games, we always end up staying up all night playing games and sleeping during the day when the arcade space is super busy. It's an all night convention so you get the most out of the arcade if you stay up all night and play games while most of the other people are back at their own hotels or are asleep. During the day and especially on the weekends it gets way too crowded in the arcade space to really enjoy it without waiting in super long lines. So it makes more sense to just become a night owl for the duration of the trip and enjoy yourself at night. We managed to get a room with a balcony in the hotel of the convention itself which is the goal every year we go. It costs a bit more but being able to sit on the balcony and wind down while still watching the convention is always worth the extra cost. Our friend seemed to enjoy himself and managed to get some autographs from a composer he really likes so hopefully he joins the yearly crew that goes. Every year I tend to focus on some different things and get some new things out of it. This time I was even more arcade focused than usual because I was really into a specific cabinet I can only find at this place every year. The other part of the trip I always look forward to is the food. There is a really good Chinese food place just a quick walk from the hotel we go to every year. There is also a steak place we go to at least once if not twice every year we go. Aside from those two though we tend to just stock up on snacks and maybe order some Grubhub or UberEats to pick up at the hotel. As lots of the convention area is overbooked with people trying to get food. We had some trouble with our room keys not working properly but other than that the trip was flawless and was a much needed vacation. I am looking forward to going again next year and I hope the same group continues to go as it's one of the things I look forward to most every year. I'm also hoping we luck out and get the balcony room again, it wouldn't be the same without it.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6,36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6,0.0,recalled

Several clothes were also purchased for all the family members and relatives. My cousin herself chose clothes for her. Invitation cards were printed and were sent to friends and relatives.

The ladies were busy with religious ceremonies. Two cooks were engaged to prepare the dinner for the guests and the bridegroom party members. Cold drinks were ready. Large quantities of fresh fruits Were also arranged for the guests. My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at seven in the evening. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. The priest chanted sholkas from the Vedas. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine.

She kept repeating that the poor baby just wasn't there anymore and she hoped she made the right choice. I got angry. Of course she didn't make the right choice! How could she not try to go to the specialist! Why wouldn't she let me take her? I can't believe I didn't even get to say goodbye one last time. My girl wasn't supposed to go yet. I am so mad that I didn't take her on that walk when I last visited. She always loved walks and I was to selfish to spare the 15 minutes. That was always her favorite. I am so sorry boo-bug.

We share a lot about our love lives, even though we don't see each other super often.  She knows that I'd been really happy in my relationship and was eager to meet him.  It finally so happened that schedules aligned and we were able to meet up.  I was a little nervous at first.  I wasn't worried that she wouldn't approve or anything, but it's always a little bit of an unsure situation introducing people you're dating to old friends. We met at the restaurant, a local burger joint/bar.  The three of us had a great time! Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully.  Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house.  Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog.  My boyfriend made fast friends, and it was really sweet seeing him interact with her dog.  Overall, we had a wonderful time, and I'm sure that my significant other made a good lasting impression on a very important friend of mine.",36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD11KEB6,,0.0,retold

It was nice to catch up with old friends. Afterwards, we went back to my friends house, where my boyfriend fell in love with her dog.

At first, I didn't want to listen to it, but as time passed the voice started to grow louder and louder. I started to notice things that I seemed to have been to naive to notice at first. Mainly though, my mental health was in a very terrible place and working at this job did nothing but seem to make it worse for me. On top of that, I was not being compensated properly and I discovered I was having money constantly stolen from me. So one day I went in to collect my paycheck and I was getting excuses as to why it wasn't there. As I was walking out, I just kind of decided ""fuck it"" and I never returned. At first, I slightly regretted the decision. Not because I believed it was the wrong decision or anything, but because it was such an impulse decision and I didn't really have a back up plan at the time. Looking back, I am extremely happy I made that decision. Financially speaking, it was very dumb. But I can honestly say that I started to feel loads better mentally after I quit.

A big reason that motivated me was the fact that he was spreading a message that was so profound but no one else knew about. He had no political background so his name recognition was next to nothing. I didn't want to tell too much people about it because I didn't think that they would care enough to come with me. I only told one friend who I knew would be interested. The scene at the rally was amazing. It included so many people from different backgrounds.

However with the encouragement of my sister in law I periodically kept texting Hannah and just a few months ago she began responding. I am most thankful for her advice and support and now she and I are messaging on a regular basis and beginning to restore our relationship. In 2016 I took up a new hobby of making walking sticks from trees in which ever area of the country we happened to be in. Since we travel ever few months for work this means a selection of unique woods to work with. I made one for her putting a lot of work into it and it turned out very nice. She initially declined my offer to give it to her in early 2017, but I kept it and as time progressed to this summer her first real communication back to me was asking if I still had her stick. I told her I did and offered to send it to her. She now has it and even just sent me a picture of her with it while on a hiking trip. We do have a long ways to go yet, but are making real progress. I do think that she is finally seeing that I am not the horrible person that her mother made me out to be. Certainly I am not perfect and could have been a much better father, but I'm not the ogre that my ex wife imagined. My daughter may even be coming to spend some time with me for Christmas. I'm going to Vermont with my brother and family the week before Christmas and my daughter may get to join us. All because of a four foot piece of sassafras that had a vine growing around it. Along with several hours of whittling, a fair amount of sanding and nine coats of linseed and varnish. My daughter is my only child and means the world to me. Since we have started communicating again I have found out the she is actually carrying a double major in school (Psychology and Philosophy!) and will graduate in the spring and plans for a graduate degree in Psychology and probably a Phd after that. I am so very proud of her. We haven't yet discussed why she rather suddenly decided to get back in touch with me, but the time will come for that.

It was strained prior to that  but devolved even more so at that point. She was sixteen at the time and is twenty two now.  Initially I would see her every couple of weeks for lunch and then once a month or so. After not being able to make a lunch date in late 2015 we have not physically seen each other only communicating by short, usually one (my) sided text messages. In January of 2018 I sent her a text apologizing for  being a bad father and asking her forgiveness I certainly had not been an ideal father, although her mother was not an ideal role model herself. I also offered to send her a walking stick I had made for her. I make a very few of them every year for significant people in my life. Each one is unique and cut from trees native to the area where I am at the time. This was a very nice sassafras stick with a spiral pattern from a honeysuckle vine having grown around it. It takes a few months for each stick, two to three for it to dry, a couple of weeks for whittling the bark and other designs and then two to three weeks for the oiling and varnishing.  She declined the stick and also did not accept my apology, replying back just how bad I had been. About three weeks ago I got a text from her late in the evening asking if I still did some woodworking and if I still had the stick I made for her. I replied that I did and would be happy to send it to her. She said she would be happy to have it., I found a long enough box and shipped it to her. She received the stick two weeks ago and truly liked and appreciated it. Our relationship definitely seems to be on the mend and we are communicating more, although I am very, very careful to take this slowly. I do not know the reason(s) for this change and will not ask her for them. I just am very thankful that she is wanting to at least have some relationship with me.",37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0VKRD6A,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0VKRD6A,0.0,recalled

He said you can either quit which will look better on your resume or I will fire you, You choose, sign these papers. It all happened so fast. I grabbed my stuff and walked out. I was relieved because I couldn't stand him but I was shocked that I wasn't even given a heads up!

Often times, tasks involved his personal life, such as taking his mom to the grocery store, or going into his house when no one was home to retrieve something for him.

He had been taking lessons since he was four years old on piano and then started several other instruments in the first grade.  He practiced his heart out each day for up to an hour or more for years and took private lessons as well as lessons at school.  Difficulty arose when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started suffering from delusions at the young age of only nine.   His mind gave him difficulty concentrating to say the least.  He had periods of wellness and periods of struggle and fights in his brain over what was reality and was wasn't.  The years went by with many changes in medications and suffering on his part due to the side effects of his medications.  I didn't know if he would be able to make it to participate in such a challenging endeavor.  He works so hard, but his mind is constantly giving him a fight.  He went into the school year optimistic and fully devoted to doing his best.  The year pressed on and he pressed on as well practicing and attending doctor's visits to keep him well.  He had some bounces up and down with medication adjustments needed.  He kept fighting the fight and practicing.  He played when he could and took a rest break in the halls when needed.  Others didn't see the struggles except in his section of the band occasionally they would see a tear come from his eyes before he had to take a break in the hall.  His struggles were mostly hidden except to me who could observe his pain and sorrow even though he didn't even know what was causing it.  Bipolar is a hidden illness because you have to keep it hidden to stay afloat in the real world.  It causes symptoms that aren't even understood by the person experiencing them.  Sadness comes without any warning or preceding events.  Sometimes silliness comes without even anything to joke about.  It is odd, but can stop you in your tracks.  I was so proud when he performed in his concerts at the end of the year, because he made it another year fighting the fight to pursue his dreams.",37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZXR5AJB,37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZXR5AJB,0.0,recalled

We rented a huge log cabin in the mountains that included pin ball machines, old school video games, a pool table, swimming pool, hot tub, and large enough areas that all of us could sit around and talk. This vacation was especially memorable because my parents who are in their 70's, were able to spend time with all 5 of their grandchildren, son-in-law, nephew, married in relatives, and myself, their oldest daughter. We spent a lot of time laughing and cooking together. We would sit out on the balcony and look at the breathtaking views. We were very high up on the mountain and the drive up was pretty scary at times, LOL, yet that provided us with a lot of pictures and memories that will last forever. There were a few times that we went into the city to shop, go out to eat, and explore what the Smokey Mountains had to offer. One evening we went to a new area where there is a huge farris wheel. While I personally would not go on it, several of my family members did, and when they were at the top they took awesome pictures. My nephew said, holy crap, that thing is tall. The way he said it was so funny. He is a little guy so seeing him look at the farris wheel and understand the height of it was cool. Every morning my husband and son-in-law would go fishing. One day they brought back Trout. After they cleaned the fish my son-in-law put it on the grill and cooked it for anyone who wanted some. The first batch of fish was excellent and everyone ate it. By this time everyone was full. He still had one more fish that he had to cook. As I was eating this fish I noticed that it didn't entirely look done. I picked at it a few more times. That evening we all sat around the cabin talking and playing games. We had our telescope there so we were able to look at the stars at night and find the constellations. After everyone went to bed, I woke up around midnight thinking I was dying. Nope, FOOD POISONING!!! I was up for several hours becoming best friends with the porcelain god. While it was not funny at the time because I was literally thinking that I was dying, I look back now and laugh because everyone talks about me getting food poisoning and the shape that I was in. Lucky for them, I took one for the team",,37QW5D2ZRH8X16KK7JVO4CBR2IVS89,0.0,recalled

She passed away in her sleep from a heart attack. It was a shocking and unexpected event for our family. She did not have a will in place so this has made it very difficult on our family to handle all of her business. The morning that it happened my father woke me up and told me that she was gone. At first I didn't understand what he meant by gone. I thought maybe she went shopping or something. When I got out of bed the ambulance was just leaving with her. My family all piled into the car to go down to the hospital where they were taking her. They basically pronounced her dead on arrival at the hospital as the EMT's in the ambulance were unable to revive her. My father was very emotionally upset by this event. We also struggled to handle her funeral arrangements as we did not have access to any of her bank accounts. Funerals are so ridiculously expensive. The social security administration offers a few dollars in death benefits but those can only go to a spouse not to a child to assist in burial. Even the cheapest option being cremation was well over 1,000$. It's difficult because the hospital only gives you 24hours to handle this and have the funeral home pick up the body from the hospital.",37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E68JBQ,,0.0,retold

My grandmother was a very influential and important part of our family. My grandmother was the matriarch of the family. The day that it happened my father knocked on my door in the morning and woke me and told me that my grandmother was gone. I immediately jumped out of bed. The paramedics has just taken her in an ambulance to the hospital while trying to resuscitate her. My father was totally devastated by this event.

His sister helped with a lot of the planning since she was a professional wedding planner until she had children and stopped doing that. She helped pick out this wonderful natural location in the woods of a park that me and him met and went on frequent walks at. The location was so special to us! She picked out a wonderful live band and said that it would be so much better than having a DJ playing, and it was! The music was so good and it wasn't a typical crappy wedding band. This band was LEGIT! Another thing that really shocked me was how little the food cost but how much of it we had gotten! There was food for a month for everyone and it didn't cost an arm and a leg!

I was hurt by it because, throughout our marriage, we've worked tirelessly to build trust with one another; to cultivate respect and empathy. We've worked to undo the unhealthy lessons of our upbringings and to get past our deeply ingrained insecurities and mistrust for others. We've made great strides. In that moment though, when I discovered this stupid thing he'd hidden from me, I felt like everything that we'd worked for was moot; that it didn't matter to him. We'd built this life with our home, our beloved pets, our mutual hobbies, our nights in laughing on the couch...all of it. We were sitting on our bed together, discussing the issue when we fell into a silence, unsure of where the conversation was going or what good it was doing. I remember tears rolling down my cheeks when I heard our cat, Archie, batting around a small gumball. They're his favorite toys. He doesn't eat them, just bats it around our wood floors for a while until I replace it. My husband and I both heard the tell-tale 'roll, clatter, clatter, roll' when we said, unprompted and in perfect unison: ""Get that gumball, Archie."" We both let out a gasp of a laugh. It was bizarre, both of us uttering this weird concoction of words that no one else has probably ever said. Thinking of them in the same order and at the same time. We smiled quietly and sat in that moment for a little while. It's been a few months since then and I still think about it occasionally, especially when I hear a faint 'roll, clatter, clatter' in another room. I think about our problems as a couple and how we've hurt each other and how it will take time to heal from things.

I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: ""Get that gum ball, Archie."" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years. Thank you, Archie. You deserve all the gumballs. Me and CatDad love you a lot.",37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,0.0,recalled

We went a few hours early to beat the initial crowds and see practice. We got an early dinner and settled in for the game. It was an exciting game that went back and forth. Lots of people were at the game and added to the experience. It was exciting for me since I hadn't been to a game in awhile. I had struck up a few conversations with the people around us as well. We were above the visitor's dugout so we got to be very close to the action. After some exciting plays the home team was winning. However in the last inning it all fell apart and they lost.

So I kept a close eye on the weather forecast for the day we were to go. Unfortunately it looked like rain and there ended up being a major storm in the morning. Lots of rain and really no sign of it breaking up, until around mid-day where all of a sudden it went away. So we met up and it was actually very nice weather by the time we arrived at the park. There were a lot of people there even with the threat of rain. We had dinner at the park before the game and sat down to watch the game. The people who sat around us were all nice and we had conversations about the game. The game went long and it was an exciting one with lots of action. Unfortunately our team ended up losing in a heartbreaking fashion in the last inning. After the game it took a while to leave the stadium and even longer to get out of the parking ramp I was in.

We really like florida so it was a no brainer on where we were going. I booked the airfare and the hotel. We were so excited to go. The trip was to celebrate different birthdays. we had two connecting flights that we had to catch. The first leg was awesome. As we got on to board the second leg we removed from the plane because the flight attendant said my husband had an extra carry on. He was carrying the bag for an elderly member of our family and he tried to explain that but they didn't care. We had to get off the plane and take a later flight.  It put a horrible taste in out mouth for the beginning of our trip. We put so much money into this trip that it really made me so angry with the airlines. We missed scheduled activities because of the delay. The part that stuck with me was how we were treated by the airline. It will probably be our last rip for awhile simply because of how we were treated.,,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2EG3RRCM,0.0,recalled

I hope whoever moves in will take care of the house and that my family and their family will get a long all right. I miss my neighbor. I know she's gone now but it still feels like she's there, somehow. I got angry the other day because her family hired someone to mow her old lawn, and the worker did a hack-job on it, probably because he knew she was dead (he used to mow the lawn for her when she was alive, too). That just really upset me. I found it completely disrespectful. She deserved better than that, not to mention her family that paid him.

I have lived in this house forever (as I inherited it from my parents when they passed away, back when I was in college). I grew up knowing this neighbor. I viewed her as part of my extended family. She would always walk her adorable Yorkie dog down the street, and if I were outside, she would stop to talk to me about the day. When I learned of her passing, I decided to attend her funeral. Her funeral was on a Thursday. I asked my in-laws if they would watch my son, who is only six. He cared a lot for our neighbor, too, but he is so young he doesn't quite understand the concept of mortality yet. I didn't want to expose him to her if her casket was open. (It was.)At the funeral, I talked to other neighbors who were equally upset and sad. I hugged her family. I watched a slideshow of photos that also showed her husband, who had passed away earlier.

There had never been an event like this before, so it was intense, fun, and only at the price of $15 for admission. Each group that went on showed power, intensity, and all around had a great time. All of the groups on the sidelines cheered on for each other and took pictures and videos of the event and the groups performing. We all had a love for each other that could not be explained. I truly felt part of a community bigger than myself and was proud of each and every group that performed. My greatest surprise were the students attending the event. They danced NON STOP for three hours straight. The physical capability and determination was beyond overwhelming. In the end everyone was exhausted, but so happy at the event turnout. The event was a huge success because we were able to raise a lot of funds and get a lot of donations for the children in Haiti for their upcoming school year.

I was told about this event about 3 months ago and we formed dance groups in order to raise funds for children and families in Haiti. The host of the event was going to personally fly to Haiti to deliver items and school supplies to the families with her charity group and make a difference in her community. I did not think much of the event as I have been in events before, but this event was life changing. I met so many new people in our dance community with such loving and caring hearts. We all became one that day and supported and cheered each other on to do our best. Each dance group had something different to bring to the stage and many genres were learned and appreciated. We all were amazed at the hard work and dedication that was brought to make the event such a huge success. At the end, the event was able to raise a lot of funds for the children of Haiti and many school supplies were donated for them to have a successful school year. It was a truly amazing event that I will never forget surrounded by even more amazing people. In the end it wasn't about the dance groups, the attendees, or who did the best. It was all about the kids and who we were raising money for. Doing good for your community as well as others in need really humbles you and makes you realize how much you have. It is very important to realize these things in life to really appreciate the life you have been given, and what you can do to make it even better for others. If I was given the opportunity to take part in another event like this, I would do it in a heartbeat. I'm sure the rest of my colleagues would agree as well.",37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N,37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N,0.0,recalled

I know that we are going to be happy together and with our kids being grown I don't foresee any conflict among them and feel that they will all mesh.

In June we went to Rome Italy for a week long vacation she had booked for us.  It was a trip of a lifetime for me as I had rarely traveled anywhere outside of the United States.  We left Dallas and flew to London for a 6 hour layover.  It was long enough where we could leave the airport and experience a little of the area before flying on to Rome.  After a few days in Rome touring all of the sites I had only read about we had dinner at an extremely fancy restaurant.  It was there that my life changed for the better.  I was widowed about ten years ago and I didn't think I would ever marry again.  Much to my surprise Michelle proposed to me.  I know it isn't the traditional way this was supposed to work but I was floored.  My heart and mind were racing that I don't even remember saying yes but she said I accepted right away.  The look on her face made me the happiest man in the world.  I truly believe we were destined to be together but it took me some nudging to make me realize it for real.  For the rest of the trip I was walking on air.  I have finally found happiness in my life again.

I was 8 months pregnant so, I was worried that I had possibly lost the baby, and the blood was the sign. As soon as we got to the hospital, I was checked to see if I was dilated at all. They immediately informed me I was 8 centimeters dilated and needed to be admitted to give birth. I immediately was given the epidural, so after a while I didn't feel any pain, thank goodness.

She walked out of the room for a second and then came back to pop my water. As soon as that was done, the contractions sped up, and I was ready to start pushing within the next twenty minutes.

When he was first admitted to the hospital he was spitting up some blood but everyone thought it was because of the pneumonia. While he was at the hospital the bleeding got much worse. He started spitting up so much blood that the white wash rags at the hospital were completely red. We knew that he had one spot on his lung that the doctors were following, but the second spot came as a surprise. He was never officially diagnosed with lung cancer but we know that is what he had. The bleeding got so bad that they had to give him a suction hose to keep it cleared out. He got to where he could not breath at all and his oxygen was turned up as high as it would go. He never wanted to be put on life support so the family just stayed by his side as all the machines were turned off and he drew his last breath.  I was devastated having to watch someone that was so strong and loved life so much take his last breath. My uncle was my last living relative other than cousins. He was our family elder. I grew up with him and my aunt being just right down the road from me for over 30 years.  Life goes on, but it certainly will be a lot sadder without him.",384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59AR8S0G,384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59AR8S0G,0.0,recalled

I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholy about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. My mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. I got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. It was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.",384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59JKL0SW,,0.0,recalled

Leading up to the wedding, he was noticably stressed the closer that it got but myself and the 2 other groomsmen helped to make it the best experience possible. We've all known eachother for a long time. When we got there we caught up with the grooms parents and other family members and took several pictures. The ceremony was beautiful, although it was very hot outside that day. So hot by the way, that the groom blacked out and lost his footing during the exchange of vows! He winded up being ok and the incident only lasted about 3 seconds, but he continued right on. The ceremony was set outside was right in front of a gorgeous lake but it was easily 102° that day. I was paired with the grooms sister, so we were introduced together when we walked into the reception hall. That was a lot of fun. During the reception, the fun really began. There was plenty of food, music, and drinks. Our table of the groomsmen and bridemaids as well as the parents table got served food first. We had salmon and filet mignon with asparagus, mashed potatoes, and a garlic aioli sauce. The night ended around 11:30pm. Noone wanted to leave, as we were all having a great time. Everyone was very happy with the way the wedding turned out, especially my best friend, the groom.",,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DV1UR0R,0.0,recalled

It was around winter time.  Winter time in Georgia is nice and cool.  There were just a few others in the canyons.  They seemed to also be enjoying themselves. There were many look out points and photo ops.  The canyons formed from poor farming techniques.  There are still cars from the 50s parked in the very spots they went out of order.  We look forward to do doing this again.  It was a great family adventure.,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DXJYR0X,,0.0,retold

This was a very special event because the day was epic.   The day started out rather foggy for the two hour drive south.  The scenery along the way was beautiful as the sun was just rising.  We started the trip early to arrive before others.  We packed our backpacks with snacks and drinks for the trail.  The trail is about an 8 mile loops down inside canyons.              When we arrived, we paid the $5 parking fee.  We also took one last proper bathroom stop.  The view was amazing from the top walkway.  No one else had arrived yet as we started our trek down.  The canyon walls are made of Georgia Clay and the trees were so green.  We hiked for about four hours, took our lunch break and then continued on.               There were plenty of canyon inlets we didn't get a chance to see on that trip, but one day real soon we will return and do it all over again.

Our children were ""at the babysitter"" (that's what I was told).  So, I quickly dressed.  I really did not want to leave, but I was hungry.

I didn't expect that my wife would actually do something like that.  She is sweet, but not much of one on surprises.  On top of my wife's surprise, everyone in my family was there.

The trip was a last-minute one - I wasn't even going to go, but I'm glad that I did. Actually, I haven't gone to a theme park in years prior to this outing. Super fun, I know. Anyway, the day started off pretty well. I was dreading the wait times to get into the park, but they weren't so bad. The lines for some of the rides were crazy long, though! For most of the day, I sat on the sidelines and just watched the kids in my family play in the water, but eventually the adults asked me to get on some rides with them. I protested at first, but eventually they got me to get in line to a ride with them. And not just any ride, but one of the tallest/scariest rides in the park! While waiting at the lower-end of the stairs, I was fairly calm, but as we got closer and closer to the top, some fear set in. I couldn't turn back because we were so far up and too many people behind us. There was no other way to get down besides riding down that long, dark tube. Once it was our turn to go down the slide, I gripped onto the handles of the tube as tightly as possible, and next thing I know, we were being pushed down the ride.

I've been to regular theme parks, but never a certified water park. I'm glad this is where we went because this day was super fun (even with the perils of summer). As always, the lines to get in were long. It was hot outside. I almost got stung by a bee! It was all well worth it because I got to conquer my fears. Theme park rides scare me. The speed, the slopes, that fluttering feeling in my stomach, the dark tunnels. Getting me on one takes an awful lot of persuasion! However, I faced my fear. I went on one of the most intense rides in the park, and I survived! I was screaming the whole way down, but I did it.

Stop at the Steel Visitor Center for your first taste of rustic lodge architecture—look for the “snow tunnel”—and to watch the short but instructive film on the lake’s origins. en proceed to Rim Village, where you’ll see license plates representing just about every state and Canadian province and hear myriad languages. Here you can catch your first glimpse of the legendary blue water and stretch your legs on the Discovery Point Trail. Easy enough for families with young children, the 1.3-mile trail parallels Rim Drive, offering several tantalizing views of the lake with virtually no elevation gain. Want more? Continue on to the fire lookout at Watchman Peak, which, at 8,013 feet, is one of the highest points in the park. After the steep climb, enjoy the payoff: an unparalleled view of Wizard Island in its bowl of blue. You’re in for a treat, because you planned ahead—way ahead—and booked a room in the Crater Lake Lodge. Originally completed in 1915, this classic example of “Parkitecture” was almost lost. The building was failing under the heavy snow loads each winter, and it took a huge public outcry—and great expense—to prevent its razing. Though much of the lodge was re-built entirely, the design remains true to and even improves upon the original vision, with larger guest rooms and updated amenities. Step into a different century and enter the splendid dining room, with its unpeeled tree trunk columns, exposed wood ceilings, large windows and muscular stonework. Or, if the weather cooperates, sit on the veranda and sip Chardonnay while contemplating the view. e experience is made even lovelier with Northwest fare such as sweet corn fritters, field green salad with Oregonzola cheese, and balsamic-glazed lamb chops. If day one was all about the views, today is about getting up close and personal with an open-air boat tour of the lake. Pack a picnic and take East Rim Drive to the Cleetwood Cove Trail, which provides the only legal shore access in the park. If you’re brave, launch yourself off a short cliff once you reach the shore. Brace yourself: the water averages 55 degrees, even in August",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL32A6WU,0.0,imagined

First, we went west to Colorado where we stayed with a friend studying aerospace. Next, we traveled down through Utah where we spent time at Arches National Park. We sped south and stopped at the Grand Canyon, only to find out it was snowing and so foggy we couldn't see anything. We next headed to Tuscon where we stayed with family and experienced car trouble. We spent three days working on our van. After Arizona, we made a quick stop in Roswell in search of aliens. Next we drove to Texas to visit a friend and see Corpus Christie. We headed to Louisiana afterwards to see family and all the Big Easy has to offer. We hit the road to Tennessee next where we visited a friend we hadn't seen in a long while before heading back to Missouri, where we quickly had to move out of our apartment. We made a lot of memories and got to experience more of the United States than many have.

I traveled back to my home town of St. Louis, Missouri for the event. I took my girlfriend along with me, it was her first trip to my home town ever.  The trip started out great, we picked up our rental car and went to grab a pizza. The following day was my brother's wedding ceremony. We thought it had all been planned out thoroughly, but it turns out that nobody had checked the weather report. The day of the wedding came, it started out sunny, a hot day in late July. Clear blue skies and not a cloud to be seen. We were all so optimistic about the big day. The ceremony was scheduled for 6 PM at sunset, so it would start to cool down and allow for some reprieve from the heat of the day. In theory, that was a great idea. However, when my girlfriend and I pulled out of the driveway we noticed something new that we hadn't seen yet on the trip. Storm clouds moving in fast, and lots of them. Dark gray giants rose onto the horizon at a frightening pace. Lighting was visible in the distance as we began our drive to the wedding venue. We hoped and prayed that the storm would blow the other way, an that the outdoor wedding venue would be spared from this particular storm. Would we be able to get away with having the ceremony in decent weather? It became a race with time. As we drove to the wedding ceremony, it felt as though the clouds were following us and growing larger. As we arrived, I greeted my brother in the parking lot and asked if he though it would rain. He said maybe, it depends how fast we can get this done. Everyone was present except for the minister, one of the few people who was completely essential to the process.  As the minister arrived, it finally began to rain. It was raining on my brother's wedding day, I couldn't believe it, but luckily the ceremony was completed and we had a wonderful sunny reception the next day.",,39ASUFLU6YTM6OGAEWNBVUO5Q9GEX3,0.0,recalled

So after my usual day at work , which i didn't even  get a happy birthday from my colleagues. I was kind of pissed so i headed home immediately after work. As i got home i had a thunderous happy birthday and i literally jumped out of my skin. Tears of joy kept rolling down from my eyes , my colleagues where already there. My husband just made the story of having to travel and my kids were all smiles. I was really ecstatic , what surprised me most was my parents took out time to travel for my special day even though my mum was down with stage 2 cancer. I had series of gifts from my husband and my friends. The love showed to me was unfathomable. I really wanted to get a necklace which i saw at a store some days back and to my surprise it was among the gifts i received. I have never had a surprise birthday party before and this was a new and exciting experience for me. I love my husband but this surprise made me love and cherish him more.

After 3 weeks of being home, we needed to have a family outing. We chose a park about 45 minutes from our home which was a local favorite for families with children. The weather was nearly perfect on the day we chose to go to the park. It was 75 degrees and sunny with very low humidity. The park was in down but in a secluded area. Although there were several other families at the park, the park is large enough and spread out so that we were not bothered by other people. Our youngest son was still sleeping for the majority of the day. Our two older sons were outfitted with their swimming trunks and water shoes. The park has a stream running through it which has a rock bottom. Kids are able to gradually hike up or down stream through the park and view several smaller waterfalls. It was a bit challenging to keep track of our two oldest sons (ages 1 and 4 at the time) because my wife was responsible for carrying our newborn. We had a chance to take several pictures of the boys playing in the water and enjoying their time at the park. We took several family photos which was our first opportunity to do so since our youngest was born.

This park is in the middle of town and has a stream running through it with a rock bottom. Rock formations are all around the stream and numerous waterfalls are located in the stream throughout the park. This event was memorable and touching to me because it was the first time that we had all been out together as a family since our youngest son was born several weeks earlier. We have 3 sons aged 4, 20 months and 4 weeks. Each of them had a different experience in the park. My oldest son had a great time by running upstream and jumping from the rocks into the water. My middle son also enjoyed himself by carefully walking through the water and commenting on the leaves he saw floating in the water or the small minnows he saw swimming. My youngest son is still too young to appreciate the experience but he was awake for the majority of the time while we were at the park. This event was also good for my wife who hadn't had much of a chance to get out of the house since our youngest son was born. The weather was warm but it was cooler in the shade where the stream was located. We also packed a picnic lunch that we enjoyed when our hiking through the stream was finished. Several weeks later, my two oldest sons are still talking about our experience at this park. I'm thankful for the time that we were able to spend together. I feel it's very valuable to get our kids outdoors as much as possible and let them play and exhaust some energy.",39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QMTWV1Z,39GAF6DQWSMVIYH32TRE0P8QMTWV1Z,0.0,recalled

Our cost of living is much cheaper here. So I offered to help host him and show him around. I was really nervous. What if we didn't get along and I was stuck with him for days? What if it ruined our work-based friendship? Would he like me? Would he see me as trashy? But ultimately it went really well. My fears were unfounded. We got along great in person and had a good time. I drove him all over and we got to chat and hang out. I don't get to do a lot of things without my kids, so it was really refreshing.

We had talked on the internet quite a bit, and even shared pictures with each other but we'd never actually seen each other in real life. We'd talked on the phone, but that doesn't really show what a person is like. I was really nervous and had the whole thing planned out in my head how it would go. Of course, it didn't happen exactly as I planned. Luckily, it still went really well. My friend plans on moving to the area and being able to hang out with him for a few days really put my mind at ease. He looked just like his pictures and sounded just like he did on the phone, so I wasn't shocked or disappointed. He was actually much calmer in real life and I think our personalities meshed quite well. He brought along his dog that was even cuter than expected. I showed him around our area and he was surprised to see a lack of trees, but ultimately things were very similar to his hometown. He's from a large metro area and I'm from a smaller town, with lots of rural suburbs. The cost of housing surprised him and I thought for sure he would be disappointed by our lack of food choices, but he seemed relatively impressed. We ate at a few restaurants that I hadn't tried since I don't get out of the house much. I'm looking forward to having a friend close by, as most of my friends live across the country from me so we don't get to see each other often.",39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUPTJ4Y,39GHHAVOMGD3J2ES8MWXVZ4ZUPTJ4Y,0.0,recalled

It is by far the most memorable day of my life. We met in high school, became teen parents, and had been dating for a little over 14 years. We had a long 5 year engagement, just to ensure that our wedding day was perfect. We paid for everything and planned everything on our own, which I think adds to memory of our special day. We both had input and we tailored our decisions to stay true to our love story, as well as highlighting our very different personalities. It was a great day and when we read our vows, people cried. We had a very intimate setting, very close friends and family only, and I think it made it that much more special. We really just focused on ourselves and each other, something a lot of couples forget to do. I've heard so many times, from friends and family, that they wish they could go back and do it all over again. I've heard a lot of stories about how the day flew by and that they never took the time to actually enjoy it. A lot of people regret the decisions they make when it comes to their wedding day. They wish they would have had a smaller or a less expensive wedding. A lot of my friends and family believe they wasted a large sum of money on one single day and ended up being in debt afterwards. We took all of those stories and we decided to not let that be our story. We bought everything with cash, nothing as a loan or on credit. We made our own smorgasbord of food and desserts. We treated it like Thanksgiving. It was awesome and delicious. We worried less about being flashy and classy and more about being comfortable and memorable. We wore what we wanted and didn't have a dress code for our guests. There was no rehearsal dinner, no huge reception. We told people to come as you are and bring their own drinks. Everyone really enjoyed just relaxing, eating good food, and letting loose. It was beautiful, laid back and there's nothing I would change about our special day.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVY0Z28VW,0.0,recalled

It was a unicorn cake like she made when I was a little kid. I got to feel young at heart and it was a great day to make me not feel so bad about turning a scary number. My parents gave me a gift there, and it was a ticket to Seattle, where I had always wanted to go. I'll get to spend a few days there enjoying the coast and the big forests around the state.

It is not the first time we have seen them. In fact, that was the very first concert we ever went to together. We love going to concerts and do so many times a year. This particular concert will remain in my memory as by far the best concert ever. The evening started off completely normal. We stopped to have a quick meal before the and got to our seats just in time. REO Speedwagon was the first band to play. After Styx started playing, around the third song in I saw my boyfriend hand someone behind us (that we didn't know) his phone. The next thing I know, he is down on one knee and has a diamond ring in his hand asking me to marry him during the song ""Lady"". The people behind us were recording the event and that's why they had his phone. I was in complete and utter shock. Of course I said YES! Afterwards he told me that he had asked all three of my kids (who are in their 20s now) and even called my father to get his blessing. This will be a second marriage for both of us so he didn't have to go through those formalities but I thought it was very sweet that he did so. We have been together a long time and I honestly didn't think we would ever get married since we've both done that before so I was beyond surprised. He is my best friend and I am so lucky to have him in my life and now to become his wife.

Even though I don't like to have my picture taken, I'm so glad he had someone videotape the proposal. It's really funny to see the shocked look on my face. After the proposal, he told me that he first for permission from my girls and my dad as well. I thought that was a very noble gesture and something that he didn't have to do. Now we have a wedding to plan. I feel so blessed to marry the love of my life who is also my best friend. I wonder how I ever got so lucky.",39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYUJC8V4,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYUJC8V4,0.0,recalled

The case worker said he was a perfect child, who was just neglected by his drug addict mother.  The child had been in a facility in another state for 4 months, and we were scheduled to travel there to visit him. We visited the facility and were surprise to see that it was essentially a child prison, detention center. It was brutal, especially since we had been told the boy was basically without many issues. We returned home after the visit and asked when the child would be discharged, we were told he would be there at least one year. We became less interested in the three to four phone calls and the additional family therapy session we had been participating in after the case worker told us that his prior home had kicked him out for threatening to kill their daughter by choking her to death with a plastic bag. Violent tendencies and  Schizophrenia  ( he was hearing voices to hurt others) is a no-go for us so we ended our inquiry on that child. The caseworker had lied about his violent nature and also lied about how many pairs of glasses the state had bought the child in the last 4 month. They only bought 1 pair, after our visit because we insisted he needed a new pair. The case worker lied to us and said they had bought 4 pair in 4 months, so we no longer trusted that dude. The strange thing is that although the caseworker got all rude and defensive he failed to take us off the boy's call list. Christmas day, 3 phone calls and I talked to the little guy because he has no one else to turn to, all very sad because I now see that caseworkers are the reason kids age out of foster care. They think they own the children and they actually hurt their chances for a perfect home. We have been searching for the right child for 4 years now, and caseworkers have proven  to be forgetful, careless and uncaring, they pretend to care, but they aren't there for those kids at all. Time will tell if we ever do bring a child into our home, time is not the child's friend, as most simply age out of the system and never find a loving family because the system is a money making machine for the states.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHPW3CVX,,0.0,retold

He is in the foster car system and we are hoping that when he gets out of the treatment center he will have learned new behaviours that will make it easier for him to have a successful adoption experience in our home. The trip to the facility was distant. It was busy with traffic and it seemed like rather a scary undertaking. We had to rent a car and drive in a strange area to us. We arrived at the destination. We then went into the building and it seemed more like a prison than a place a child would be living. They immediately had to take any cell phones. They then proceeded to check us for weapons. Then they would unlock each door we entered. It was definitely a maximum security type of place. It seemed unusual to us that a child under 13 would need to be in a maximum security type environment for simply having Autism. The facility we visited has kids of all kinds separated into units, some are court ordered, some are private pay and some are insurance paid. I think most parents would be alarmed if their autistic child was put in a place like that. It had no with real atmosphere of a real home. I would rate it as terrible.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHPW3CVX,39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHPW3CVX,0.0,recalled

After ordering a drink from a bartender friend at a local bar, and relaxing, going through some news alerts and other notifications on my phone, my friend introduced me to another patron at the bar. We were only around 5 or so people in the bar at the time, so my friend introduced to me a guy who had just moved to the area for a job. We started talking that night about random things, but mostly about music and played different music we liked on the jukebox. I ended up talking with my now boyfriend for the rest of the night until the bar closed, but we didn't exchange any information with one another to get in contact again. I went back to the same bar two nights later and I was happy to see this guy, my current boyfriend, again in the bar. We ended up talking the rest of the night there and until the early morning hours, since neither of us had to worry about work the next day, since it was the July 4th holiday. We exchanged phone numbers when we went to our homes, and made plans to see one another the next day. We did not actually see each other on the 4th, however, but we did re-make the plans and met on that Friday the 5th. After seeing each other again that Friday, our chemistry was undeniable and we both knew we liked one another. From that point, we were seeing each other every day, if only for a few hours a day. Soon after, we actually made our relationship official, even though friends had already assumed we were together since we were always together when we would go out, whether to the bar we met or to a restaurant or a movie. A few weeks into dating officially, it was my birthday and my boyfriend took me to a really nice birthday dinner and we starting talking more about the future and our future together. About a month later, my boyfriend officially moved in with me, because we were spending so much time together and our feelings were real, so it made sense and we wanted to do so to spend more time together. It has been 20 weeks since we met, to the day, and our relationship has only gotten stronger as we have lived together and continued to learn more about each other. I could not have imagined that going for a drink on a random Monday night would have led to me meeting the man I hope to spend the rest of my life with, but 20 weeks ago it did happen and I'm grateful to my friend for introducing us that night.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRD7VCK,,0.0,retold

I did not expect it to be an eventful night or anything, I had just had a long day and wanted to go out for a drink. While I was at the local bar, my friend, the bartender, mixed up my drink order and later re-purposed that drink into a round of shots for him, myself, and another patron at the bar. My friend introduced me to the other patron and said that we would get along. After we took the shots, the other patron and I started a conversation and the conversation was light and cordial, but I really got along with the other patron. We got along so well in fact that we ended up staying until the bar closed that night talking. The conversation with the other patron was very easy and we quickly transitioned into talking about a variety of different topics including music, what we did, where we were from, and other topics, including what was around the area since he had just moved to the area. We did not exchange numbers or anything that night, but then I saw the same patron that Wednesday night, the third of July. When I saw him in the bar, I went over to him to say hi and we started off talking small talk again. Even though this was only the second time I had met him, we got along so well and the conversation was so easy that it felt like we had known one another for much longer. That night we ended up hanging out talking until the morning. That Friday, the fifth of July, we actually intentionally met up at the bar for drinks and ended up hanging out all night again too. Ever since that Friday, the fifth of July, we have seen each other every single day, often for most of the day, especially on the weekends. The random patron I met on a random Monday night in a local bar, who had just moved to the area, ended up becoming a good friend very quickly and that friendship quickly transitioned into a relationship. Now eight weeks later, we are still together and we have already discussed moving in together since we spend so much time together and he is mostly at my place, and several weeks ago we told each other that we loved one another. The way we met was completely random, and we might not have ever met had I not decided to go out that Monday night, had his roommate not told him about the local bar, or had a different bartender been working, but I am very thankful that all those things, and more, did happen because I have gained a relationship and have been very happy since meeting my now boyfriend.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRD7VCK,39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRD7VCK,0.0,recalled

His name was Kich. He was 17. He was one of the best things to ever happen to me, hands down. He was black, long, and thin with elegant features. He lived a good life despite illnesses. He was such a good and sweet buddy, my most precious gift to have ever received from life. Now that I look back on it, I thought he was going to live strong seemingly forever because he could escape brushes with death and seemed that he could last longer, but slowly, his health started to decline until it was snowballing. I said goodbye to him in disbelief that he was really gone, that I couldn't do anything to keep him here, that I couldn't take away his suffering. I will never forget the moments when I saw him slip away forever. Just a couple days later, my other cat who lived with my ex husband died. He died at home of old age, just as his brother had. I still can't believe both my boys are gone and there's a part of my heart that is so empty without them. The only thing that makes it ok is that nothing can hurt my boys anymore.

We were all dressed in black, and my anxiety was running a little high thinking about how I would be able to properly compose myself. I was worried about how I'd react when I saw my aunt and my cousins who had just lost the man they used to see every day. I couldn't stop thinking about them the most and how much pain this event had caused them. The first person I saw was my cousin and as soon as we met eyes I couldn't help but feel overwhelmed with grief for him. Seeing him made tears pour down my face and we had yet to even begin the ceremony. I panicked, thinking I really should have brought a whole box of tissues into the church with me. I spilled my heart out and told him how much I missed his dad and how I had been thinking about him, his sister and his mother. He cried, too, which is something I had never seen before in my whole life knowing him. Then I saw my aunt who was surrounded by family, receiving hugs and words of consolation. I just stood where I was, watching, but it all felt so surreal - it was like an out of body experience. She had been on my mind so much that finally seeing her in this moment of mourning felt so strange. And to see her be there, she had never seemed more courageous to me, to be able to face this moment no one ever even wanted to talk about. My uncle had not been well for years and she served as his caretaker the whole time, but always seemed so gracious to have each day with him that she did. It was a day of so many emotions - relief that my uncle would no longer be suffering in a body that no longer served him, but complete grief and selfishness in hopes that he would bear it for longer so we wouldn't have to say goodbye. It was a day I'll never forget, and a day I find myself constantly thinking over.",39JEC7537VNF51R1IQGYHLRHRDAVCN,,0.0,retold

As you can see I despise snakes a lot due to the fact that I hate the little creatures and the potential harm they can do to other people. Therefore those little creatures are the real devil due to the fact how they can poison anything that is touched and bite yourself, therefore appearing uninvited to a wedding event is the worst gift we the guests and the people who are marrying can experience ever. It sure scared the guts out of me and the snake itself was very ugly and probably one of the poison types that if we were not careful means that it can bite anybody that is on it's way and it can be deadly consequences to all the rest of us. The wedding with my friend sure was one of the most unique I been to in a long while, despite all wedding being unique of course, the snake on the wedding was one of those things that I will not forget as long I live. Other then that my friend's wedding was great, him and the fiance were finally going to get married. Which meant it was one of the most exciting events for me and my friend of course. Why wasn't I, his friend going to be there( if only someone told me there was a snake) of course you do anything to be there and that means even beating up the damn snake. It could have been anything a spider, shark or even a group of wild monkeys. But for god sake why snakes. Oh well at least I got to enjoy the gourmet food that was made on the wedding fresh and from scratch, which was delicious by the way. Therefore I ate as much my stomach could handle. After all weddings are suppose to be very happy events and the best days of the couple's life. Good thing I got room for the cake too, because the cake like exquisite and deliquesce they presume which means the taste got a explosion of flavor. Therefore despite the snake, it was a decent wedding.",39LOEL67OTRTHPZ5H4UNW43F8MJ38H,,0.0,retold

When I got the invitation in the mail I couldn't believe it.  He was one of the least likely friends to get married.  He was not the type that would settle down and start a family or commit to a long term relationship.  He was a traveler and could not stay in one place for long. When we graduated from high school we had gone our separate ways.  I went to study at university and he had joined the military.  We lost touch for a bit and I had not heard from him in a while.  Getting the wedding invitation was a surprise and I could not wait to see my friend again. We lived on different sides of the country so I decided it would be easiest to take a flight there.  The flight went smooth and I arrived at the destination right on schedule.  My friend picked me up from the airport.  We caught up on the drive to the wedding venue.  My friend was really happy and I was happy for him.  Everything was going great in his life. We got to the wedding just in time and I took my seat.  My friend and his wife were a lovely couple and I was glad to see my friend again doing so well.  After the wedding there was the beautiful reception.  Besides some of my friend's family there was not many people that I knew.  Most of the people there were friends of the bride or people that my friend knew or worked with. That is when I met her.  She was seated across from me at the table and once we locked eyes I could feel an immediate connection.  She was a friend of the bride and she did not know many of the people at the wedding either.  We ended up sitting next to each other talking all night long and really hit it off.

This was a huge surprise and enormous burden. I have a family, a mortgage, and we have been without health insurance for two years.  I work in the financial industry. Honestly, I'm concerned about an upcoming recession like we had in 2008.  I was expecting to start having some health insurance about a year ago, but it kept getting pushed back.  It's been very difficult to make ends meet at my house over that period of time.  Several of our bills have gone unpaid and unemployment only covers so much (not even enough to cover the mortgage).  Having M turk has really helped to alleviate some of the burden.  I've decide to branch out from some of the past jobs I've had. I'm looking at jobs in the medical industry.  I'm hoping that has a better future outlook than the financial and banking sector. My area is supposedly strong economically, but honestly, I haven't seen the results trickle down to my home life.

I had been working at the store for over a year now and I was doing great, I had gotten to the point that it was all second nature to me. I loved my job, interacting with customers has been great, my coworkers are the best, and I just really enjoy working here. I recently heard that a managerial job had opened up and they were hiring, I thought this is my chance. I've always wanted to be able to work my way up in a job especially one I enjoyed and that it would be amazing to get this job. I've been working so hard and trying my best so I really thought I had a shot but I over heard some of my coworkers talking and saying that Jenny, who has been here a little longer than me was probably going to get the job. I'll admit this hurt because I really wanted it and after hearing that I thought they are probably right. Jenny has been there longer and she does a good job and gets along well with our supervisors/bosses. I get along with them pretty well too just not to the point that Jenny does, but even though Jenny does her job well, I know I worked way harder, not to put Jenny down but I always work overtime and always volunteer for stuff. I had given up all hope of getting the job, I've had past experience in jobs that I've seen that usually the one the higher ups get along with or like the most usually got better treatment and jobs regardless of how well they worked before. I was really sad but one day my supervisor comes up to me and says ""Hey Sara, so we are looking in to hiring someone for the manager position and kind of looking at our options and we are considering you for the job."" I couldn't believe it, I honestly thought with everything I wouldn't be considered. I say ""Thank you, that's great."" She replies ""So you would be interested if we decided you would be a good fit."" ""Definitely!' I state. She laughed and headed back to work. I was so excited maybe I would get the job. I had been so excited but then time passed and no updates on the manager position. I was working one shift and it was a rough one, we had a sale and people really took advantage of it, I was exhausted when I went to leave that day, I noticed my supervisor talking with Jenny and she seemed so excited. I knew that was it she had got the job and I was so upset. Then next day when I came, I was in bad mood knowing I had missed out on the job, then my supervisor walked up to me and said what I didn't think I would hear. ""Sara there you are, I have got a surprise for you. We talked it out and have decided we would like you to be our new manager."" I was so shocked I didn't speak at first. ""Wait I thought Jenny got the position?"" ""No, not at all, you work so hard and always do great, we did consider Jenny but you always volunteer your time and customers love you, it only makes sense to make you manager."" ""Thank you so much."" I replied. I was so happy, it was the best day ever.",,39O5D9O87UEVTSPIYGASYQZYYCAC30,0.0,imagined

I told her now it is her turn to become a bridesmaid. Everyone around us expressed s o much joy regarding upcoming nuptials.

I am buying decorations, looking for a photographer, for the event, including the type of food/drinks served. I am very excited yet nervous for our wedding to happen. We also  snapped engagement photos shorty after the proposal. My fiance has helped me get things done on his end I am so happy and grateful marrying my best friend and partner. He brings so much joy in my life and he makes me feel the same way the first time we fell in love. The love never went away and hope it stays that way forever.

Prior to the wedding she asked me to be her maid of honor so without a doubt I said yes.  We've been through a lot together and she deserved the amount of happiness her then boyfriend at the time made it official. Before the ceremony we prayed together, I'm not too big on it but she is very religious. During the ceremony I shed a few tears to see the moment of happiness on both of their faces and in my mind wished true happiness together and whatever obstacle they face, it will be overcome. I also thought of my own boyfriend and imagining us in that position. I love him so much and without doubt knew he loved me the same. During the reception everyone had a good time and I danced a few times with my boyfriend. He had a look of nervousness on his face, I thought to myself I hope the wedding is not freaking him out but I got it out of my head quickly.  After the wedding we went back to our car. He was a bit silent and it was making me a bit uneasy. I asked what's wrong and he said nothing. There was a lot on his mind and I thought again oh no he is trying to break up with me? He told how long we have been together and he could not get enough of me. In my head I sighed relief and smiled at him. He says he has a surprise so he pulled out a ring box, opened it up and asked if I will marry him. I'd say yes immediately. He did not want to do it at  at the reception to not steal my friend's thunder and I'm glad he did it outside the event. I was crying tears of joy.

It was so traumatic. Never in my life did I experience homelessness until then. Having to clean up the whole house and only take a few things. Well, actually trying to figure out exactly what was most important to me. Leaving behind the furniture and some of my favorite things hurt my feelings bad. Not knowing where we were going to go had my head twisted. We cried so hard as we cleaned up. It was my pregnant mother, my little brother and I. At this point we were questioning God, ""why us?"" Later that day my moms friend told us we can stay with her for a little bit. It only lasted two weeks. Then we didnt have anywhere to go once again. We ended up staying in the shelter. It was horrible because they treated people as if they were prisoners. It was so cold and they only had cots to sleep on. They didnt even give covers. We left the next day and didnt want to go back. We ended up sleeping in the car for 3 days. Mind you we lived in upstate NY so it was extremely cold outside. My mom would always vent to her bestfriend and her bestfriend paid for us to stay at a luxury hotel for 8 days/nights. After those days were up my moms taxes had came back and we ended up at another hotel, then another one until our money ended up running out. We didnt know what we were going to do after so my grandmother made a call to one of her close friends who allowed us to stay for 2 months but then ended up kicking us out.

This event was about how I had a company that refurbished old abandoned homes and fixed them up to sell them for a higher price. One of the big reasons that my company started to go under was the fact that a serial killer had started murdering people a couple miles from the house I bought. This caused the house to sit on the market for months until the police caught the guy and by that time it was to late and I had run out of money for my business. One of the most memorable experiences I had at the time was realizing I was really down to the wire. When I had to start selling things to pay for my mortgage and electricity that was a very scary time in my life. Another memorable experience and probably the hardest was selling the tools that I had used to fix up the houses. That part was significant because that is when I had really realized that this is over and I need to start planning for what was coming. Also to try and to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy. I am less anxious and stressed now that I am living in a smaller apartment. I still wish that I would have realized that my business was failing and I should have sold my stuff more preemptively than when I had done so. I now take more ownership for my business going under. I should have had more money saved up than I did, and I do take ownership for my company failing even though it failed under such strange circumstances. Taking ownership is significant because it lets me be able to be around others when I am going through trying times instead of trying to push the blame on others. So people will be less nervous around me. I think now I do wish I could go back and fix the mistakes that I had made but the only thing we can do is push forward. I am still saving up money to try and redo the business now that I have more knowledge than before, but time will tell what happens with that.",39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7,,0.0,retold

This was a very painful event that has affected my life even unto this point today. This all started a few months ago when I bought a dilapidated house in a poor part of town that was coming back to life. The idea of this house was to buy it and take a month or two to fix it up and then eventually sell it as that has been my success making a living. Unfortunately for me things didn't turn out that way and it took me over 5 months to sell this house. The reason that it took me a while to sell this house was because as I bought this dilapidated structure murders started happening within a mile or two of this house; and the police took 5 months to catch the man who was killing people. Once this man was caught the house sold in 2 weeks. Unfortunately for me that is about when my emergency money had become nonexistent. This caused me to stop buying houses, sell all my tools which let me pay for my mortgage for 1 more month and let me put my house up for sale. I am now stable and in an apartment and looking for something else to do now that my dreams have been crushed. With failure although not the outcome it gives life lessons I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Would I love to be killing the real estate housing market with my homes I refurbished, sure, but the lessons to take away is that you should have emergency funds for a year in case some unforeseen things happen. Another lesson is that one should always have a side hustle that they are able to get into if they are struggling with their main company. Another lesson is don't buy a home one can't afford if your money starts getting tight because that will kill any hope you had left. Although these events have left me worse off economically the experience these failures I have had are priceless I'm still young and eventually could start rehabbing houses in the future I will just need to save up and hopefully one day I can do what I love correctly.",39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7,39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7,0.0,recalled

At this time, I was beginning my second year of medical school and trying to figure out how to attend school in one state and be there for my mother while she was sick at home in another state. I spent the entire 3 month summer break back home, sitting in the ICU with her all day while she fought for her health and we hoped for her to get better. When the school year started, I flew home and planned to go to school during the week and fly home to be there for my mom on the weekends. After the first week of school, I was called to return home immediately because of a short prognosis for my mom. I flew home immediately and was there for her for every second of the last 3 days she had on this earth. This was a terribly difficult time for me and my family, with my mom passing away so young and so suddenly. We have been working hard to get back on our feet. I ended up taking a leave of absence from medical school and I'll be returning to school next fall. Since my Mom's passing, there have been two other deaths in the family. One of the funerals is actually tomorrow. I just feel like this is a really difficult time in my life and I'm still trying to figure out how to use this experience for good. I have been struggling with some depression for the first time in my life and also lack of motivation. But on some days, I also feel totally happy.

About six months ago I noticed that my hand was shaking. I didn't give much consideration to it. It only seemed to happen when I was relaxing or at rest. I put it out of my mind. I ride a motorcycle and began to notice that my balance was beginning to feel off. Not a sharp decline in balance, but enough for me to know that something didn't feel right. I noticed that riding wasn't as enjoyable or as comforting as it used to be. The next thing I noticed was my balance while walking. I never had great balance to begin with but I typically could walk a straight line without much issue. Now I felt off-kilter and stumbling. I decided I needed to talk to my doctor. My primary care was very close to the vest, no indication on what she thought it might be and I was referred to a neurologist. I had MRI's, CT scans, X-rays and finally arrived at the diagnosis, Early Onset Parkinson's Disease. I am only 43, this doesn't happen to someone my age. Parkinson's is an old persons disease. I have fought with the diagnosis for some time, its not easy to accept that your body no longer wants to cooperate when you go to pick something up or shake at inopportune moments. Through therapy and meditation I am now in place of acceptance for myself and who I am. The disease doesn't change who I am at my core. It only changes what my body will allow me to do.",39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ1HBM3,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ1HBM3,0.0,recalled

What if we get robbed? But I'm glad to know I'm trusted with the day-to-day operations of a retail store and am considered a manager-in-charge. The $3.75/hr pay raise certainly helps. It means a lot because I was lied to when let go of my teaching job, and blacklisted in the university. I couldn't sue because they could retaliate against my wife.

Granted, it's the Sunday 11am-7pm shift, but it was mine and mine alone. It's great being acknowledge with a promotion and responsibility after years of neglect and downright disrespect. See, I was kicked out of a university professor job simply because the dean of the school did not like me in any way. He said that my student reviews were ""far below average"" even though they weren't, and he refused to provide the average. He said my ratings from the first semester did not get better at all, citing a single solitary number from an odd class that wasn't in my area of knowledge, and was more than a year old. I couldn't fight back because he is known for retaliation and my wife had the same job in the same school, and I don't want to screw her over. So, I had to get a retail job. I worked at a home improvement store and within four months, was sabotaged out of the department despite video evidence supporting me that magically supported them. I am 100% certain they kicked me out because I'm not a redneck like them and didn't fit in. So, I was put in a 5am-9am job six days a week for a year with no paid time off, no vacation, no benefits of any kind. Obviously, this was crap so I sought out a promotion by doing all the in-home training and in-store work that I could, but was denied it over and over. I was also lied to about a pay raise for joining the renovation team. So, I left for my current job. Within 8 months, I was promoted to a team lead with a $3.75/hr pay raise. For my two month training period, I worked with the managers to open and close the store and all the deskwork I need to do. Finally, today was my first day: I opened and closed (with setting/turning off the alarms), made the deposit and took it to the bank, counted all drawers, dealt with all customer issues, managed 3 other employees, and we didn't burn it down.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFD3TD,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFD3TD,0.0,recalled

Remembering back to the day of this life changing event, I still remember and feel the sensations of that moment as it happened on that day. Memory has a way of staying vivid when something very powerful sets motion within your senses. Moments like this are never forgotten, as if the event took place recently, even though many years,perhaps decades have faded away. Time may fade away, but when you are responsible for changing the life of someone else for the better. Unlike time, this type of significance never fades away. To this day, I think about that moment when I helped that elderly man in the store, and what may have happened to him had I not been there, as if I was sent there by forces beyond my control to earn my role within humanity. I realize every day, that my life really did change from that moment, this which reflects the overall impact of my existence, and the value of it's meaning. I just hope that someday, when I am in a time of need, that some guardian angel may rescue me from whatever negative aspects which may abound me. If I had not been there in that store on that day, at that time, would this event be someone else's memory to reflect upon, or perhaps the opposite may hold true. These memories could have been dark and painful. For had this man died as a result of nobody there to save his life, this would have been an everlasting tragic event for others close to him. Funerals are hard to forget as well. Unfortunately, that is not the type of memory I want to hold onto. So, in the long run, I feel justified with an enriched focus upon my life focus. I truly feel as though I have earned significant credit toward my worthiness as a human being on this plane of existence.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,,0.0,retold

This event was one that I shall never forget. I still wake up and wonder about our true purpose in life, and how we come into play when called upon. Things happen in our lives which we really do not understand. We certainly do not have full control over all aspects of our lives. The element of surprise is always a real variable for which can play upon our actions at any time, and any place. What took place recently for me was certainly an element of surprise for which I was called to action without warning, or preparation. What this event did prove to me was that our worth as human beings is gauged by what we know, proving once again that knowledge is a very powerful force which absolutely can save lives. One particular morning I decided to stop into a major store to check on something I was interested in purchasing. For no other reason would I have been there that day. The real reason perhaps may have been out of my control, as though I was guided there to be in place for my contribution to mankind. As I was strolling through the store looking for my item of interest, I could not help noticing that someone seemed a bit irritated and somewhat irrational in how they were communicating with another person. I didn't think much about it and continued about my business. Just moments later, it was obvious that this person was having some sort of medical problem due to their behavior and the apparent breathing problems that I had detected. I am CPR certified, and am trained on what to do in case of a medical emergency. Probably a good thing since there was not anyone else around the scene which I believe was in any position to help this person. I then took control and intervened immediately to check on the situation. As I had surmised, the person in trouble was an elderly man who had just collapsed, struggling to breath, and very incoherent to response. Immediately I commanded the closest person to call 911 and get help as fast as possible. I then evaluated the situation and began administering CPR until the medics could arrive. I noticed that the man had a medical bracelet  for which I instructed the caller to give that information to the 911 center to prepare the medics as they were en route to the scene. What seemed like an eternity to save this man's life while I was still in control, became like a major relief once the EMS team arrived, and took over. In short, The man lived without any severe consequences, and was doing great after a short stay in the hospital. This gave me a whole new perspective on life, and just how fragile we really are as we go about our lives. I still have to wonder what would have happened to that old man if I had not been called upon to be there in his time of need.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,0.0,recalled

My daughter is a year below their daughter and a year above their son so it is a perfect match.  They get along so well.  While they were here, we went on a nature walk and swam in the waterfall.  My daughter is homeschooled and her friends are limited.  Having her cousins here made her feel more involved.   They really got to act like kids and just enjoy themselves.  We had a cookout when they were here also.  The kids swam all day in our pool.  We got ice cream after the cookout.  Both cousins spent the night with my daughter.  I feel this was so important for my daughter.  She felt like she bonded with her cousins even more.  Since this event, they have been staying in touch with their phones.  They have a group chat with another one of our cousins who lives on the west coast.  It seems as if the other two cousins don't have a lot of friends either.  This bond makes them feel as if they all have someone to relate to that's in their same age group.  I really hope we get to go see them soon,  I think it would be great for all of the kids.  My daughter and her cousins actually have a lot in common so it makes it easy to get along.  We didn't sight see  a lot when they were here.  We really just hung out and let the kids play.  I think this was the best thing because it made them get to know each other more.  They had last seen each other when they were much younger so I didn't know how much they would have in common now.

One of the days they were here, we had a cookout and the kids swam the entire day.  We hadn't made any dessert for the cookout so we decided to go to our local ice cream shop afterwards.  It was a nice treat for all because it was such a hot day.  Those of us who didn't go swimming enjoyed the ice cream even more because we got to cool off with the ice cream.  When they had to leave to head back to Michigan, everyone was in tears.  My daughter's cousin who was the same age cried the hardest.  I felt so sorry for her.

My mother was always complaining about feeling really tired and fatigued so she went to the doctor. The doctor ran some tests and her heart rate was seen to be very low which they believed to be the cause of her fatigue. They recommended that she get a pacemaker put in to help regulate her heart. My mother agreed to undergo the surgery. The day of the surgery arrives and I'm with her laughing and joking around before she was called back to be put under. We had no idea the trouble that was about to occur. We were told the surgery would only be about 30 minutes or so. So they wheel my mother to the back and give her anesthesia. From my knowledge, as I was not with her at this point, was that she was still awake when they wheeled her into the operating room and she began to have a panic attack when they put the surgery cloth or whatever you call it over her face which then lead her to have a pulmonary edema. A pulmonary edema is basically your lungs being filled with fluid making it very difficult to breathe. She was taken to the ICU immediately and remained there for about a week. She was able to make a full recovery but it was close to being an absolute disaster. It was one of the most frightening things I have ever experienced. She even ended up getting the surgery for her pacemaker done later on and thankfully no complications occurred.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,,0.0,retold

It was a nice ceremony for her and her high school sweetheart, and I'm glad I was able to clear my schedule to attend. I missed her older sister's wedding which by design was essentially the same ceremony, staged in the same location and using the same exact decor and themes. As such, I felt I very much needed to make sure I at least attended one of the two. It was nice to see all my family members and I grew a little closer to a few of them. As one of the older cousins, I was proud to see how much my younger cousins have grown into young adulthood. They're certainly hitting typical life milestones faster than I am, though that's not a notable point of insecurity for me. What really struck me most profoundly is the sense of loneliness and deep-seated personal insistence on sadness I feel at events like this. They're obviously supposed to joyous occasions but I have a really difficult time experiencing those feelings in such a setting. Perhaps it's because the last family wedding I attended was my sister's back in 2012, a time when both my parents were still alive. The feelings of sadness I get at events like this can be best described almost as if I'm mourning the fact that this type of event is in my past and has passed me by. That because my parents are no longer around I'm always destined to have a radically different experience should I ever have a full on wedding celebration, that events like these, as typical and average as they may be, are completely out of reach for me. I was struck by a certain moment, when my uncle co-opted a wedding practice my dad and my sister pioneered at least in the context of our family; the montage dance sequence. It was a bit upsetting to see someone else do the thing that serves as a very unique and fond memory for me and my sister. It felt contrived and opportunistic and after witnessing it I had a minor breakdown and had to leave the venue to catch my breath and dry a few tears.",3A1COHJ8NKH8BX64WPJP0Y4PKD68HZ,,0.0,retold

After spending a few hours in the hospital I felt ok, but they wanted to do a stress test. So I waited around for that. They almost were going to do it, but my troponin levels were more elevated so ... you know, no one was really clear about things. They thought maybe they'd do a heart cath. It wasn't clear to me what exactly they wanted to do. None of the doctors actually spoke to me personally. I waited around the rest of the day and throughout the night for a doctor to come and tell me what was going on, but no one ever came. By the time morning came around I was still getting the run around from the nurses and I had enough, was feeling ok and decided to leave. I waited for a nurse to come and remove my IV and I wish I had just done it myself because she pulled it out the wrong way. I guess she was annoyed I was leaving without being properly discharged. Anyways, I checked on my medical records a couple of weeks after this visit only to find that I had had an actual heart attack which came as a bit of surprise.

I've actually had a heart attack previously. That was a full on STEMI with a complete blockage of my RCA and all the bells and whistles of a typical heart attack - basically a fireball in my chest. This time it was more of a slow crackling fire with a few spurts here and there. Anyways, I really wasn't sure it was a heart attack, but I got a little bag ready and call the ambulance. My blood pressure was 200-something over 108 in the ambulance and they said the EKG looked fine. At the hospital no one actually told me I had a heart attack. After about an hour or two sitting there I felt fine. A little winded, but otherwise no pain. They wanted me to stick around to MAYBE do a heart cath, but that would have been another two days in the hospital and as I said I was feeling fine. So I left. The nurse was a bit annoyed since this was against medical advice and she actually pulled my IV out the wrong way causing my hand to bleed heavier than normal which ticked me off. Otherwise no one came to tell me I had had a heart attack. I found out almost three weeks later when I checked my records online which showed a diagnosis NSTEMI.

I go to San Francisco to get my Visa months in advance while reading everything I can about southeast Asia. Everyone scares me by telling me about how dangerous it is and that im going to get ripped off. I'm determined to prove everyone wrong so read everything about what I can do so I look like an experienced traveler.    The day comes for the trip and im excited but nervous. It ends up taking me about thirty hours to get from SF to Ho Chi Minh City because of layovers. Since I cant sleep on the plane im just exhausted and want to sleep already. I get to immigration and someone tells me to sit down and nobody says a word to me for about an hour. I terrified that one of the military officers with AK-47s are just going to shoot me in the face and get it over with.  I go over everything that I could have done wrong and after nearly calling my mom and asking for a teddy bear I find out that the Vietnamese Consulate in SF made a mistake on my Visa and everything is fine. I hate them but its fine.    After finally getting through immigration and getting my bags I finally go outside to find a taxi to my hotel. Its about three in the morning but surprisingly there a lot of option. Some guy runs over and asks if I need a taxi and I say yes so we head over to his car. He says it will cost forty dollars and I say im only using the meter since this was something I read constantly. We go back and fourth and he says he doesnt have one. I finally say okay since im completely exhausted and I dont care at this point. We end up getting to my hotel but I later realized that about every taxi in the city costs around one dollar to get anywhere. After all my studying I made it a whole thirty seconds before I was ripped off.   In the morning I finally wake up and decide to go check out the city. I step outside in some alley and a guy comes up trying to sell me a stupid guide. I tell him no and he ends up just following me everywhere I go while he shows me pictures of other people from America like I will just start believing anything he says. While this is happening some five year old girl comes up and holds my hand while we are walking. I shook her hand off me so fast it might as well have had the plague on it. After walking through the deadly Vietnamese streets and into the market the salesman finally gave up on ever getting a sale from me.,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD,,0.0,retold

Now I have been out the country before but it was just to Europe and Canada so I wasnt quite sure what to expect. After the long thirty hours it took to get to my destination I get to customs and when I show them my passport I was told to sit down where nobody tells me a thing for an entire hour. At this point im terrified since this is my first time traveling internationally by myself and there are a bunch of people with automatic rifles who told me to sit down. The entire hour im picturing how im going to spend the rest of my life in a Vietnamese prison but eventually I find out that the consulate in San Francisco screwed something up and I was free to enter the country. So I walk down grab my bags and exchange some money for the taxi ride. For months I had been researching Vietnam and all the scams that happen so I knew one of the big ones was that you always take a taxi with a meter. As I walk out of the airport some guy comes up to me and asks if I need a taxi. I say yes and we walk to his car. He tells me $40 and I say meter but he says he doesnt have one. We go back and fourth for a while and eventually I accept since that price sounds reasonable, its 3 AM and I havent slept in over a day. So we drive to my hotel and everything is fine. Eventually I come to find pretty much every taxi is about one dollar anywhere in the city. Months of panning to not get ripped off gone out the window 30 seconds into my trip. The next day I wake up early and walk out of my hotel and see im pretty much next to the biggest market in Ho Chi Minh City so there are people trying to sell you everything. Once again 5 steps out of the hotel some guy trys to sell me on some tour which I read is a ripoff. Also the motorbikes are deathtraps so I wasnt interested. I tell this guy no 20 times but he continues to walk with me. Then he starts showing me pictures of him with only white people and their handwritten notes that talk about how amazing he is. Obviously a scam as I continue to walk to the market but he wont leave. During the walk some little five year old girl walk up to me and starts holding my hand which scares me more than anything. I try to shake my hand to get her to let go but she refuses. Eventually the man gets her to let go so at least now im happy he is there. I finally make it to the market so the man leaves.  Overall it was a difficult beginning to Vietnam but I love the country and the people who live there and it ended up being on of the best travel experiences of my life.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD,0.0,recalled

The area is becoming more and more inundated by homeless people. My friend was excited to show me the office as we parked in the building's driveway and did a brief tour just after sunset. As we were backing out of the driveway, we observed a homeless man sitting on the front porch of my friend's office and he was eating a sandwich, tossing his wrappers all over the porch. My friend was annoyed, rolled down his car window and hollered to the homeless man, ""Please pick up your trash when you're through, buddy."" As we proceeded to back out of the driveway, the homeless man jumped up and ran after us. He approached my friend's driver-side window which was still partially lowered, as if to start a conversation. The homeless man threw a handful of rocks right at my friend's head. Just as my friend pulled back, the rocks flew across the front seat of the car and struck me on the knee and hand. The sharp edges cut my skin and I was bleeding some. I yelled at my friend, ""Just get out of here!"" As my friend backed hurriedly out of the driveway, we looked in the rear view mirror and the homeless man was still running down the street, chasing us, throwing rocks at our car! When we reached a red stoplight, the man caught up to us. My friend lowered his window again, enough to take a photo of the man. I was angry at my friend for lowering the window for any reason, and again hollered, ""Just get out of here!"" I was so horrified by the event that I swore I would never to to my friend's office again. My friend continued to do business at his new location, but now, he always carries a weapon. I cautioned him to always have his head on a swivel, be on the lookout and  never arrive or leave alone, espeically after dark.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K09HCY,,0.0,retold

So I reckon it's no wonder that I've been circling the drain for the past ten years trying to find a house I can afford. Less surprising still is what happened to me, personally, just yesterday. I went with my friend, Dean, to his new office in a very popular downtown district. We couldn't get there until about 8:30 p.m. in darkness, to drop off something he needed there for an early meeting the next morning. I didn't think much about arriving there after dark, since the office location is adjacent to a large public parking lot near many tourist attractions and restaurants. Dean had complained recently about homeless people hanging out on his office steps, but there didn't seem to be any solutions or even anyone to complain to about the problem. When we had dropped off the item and were backing out of the office driveway, there was a homeless guy sitting on the office steps, eating a boxed meal, with napkins spread out, as if he were picnicking there. Dean was upset and lowered the window, asking the dude to not leave his trash on the front steps. As we drove away, the homeless guy started running after us. He walked up to Dean's driver side window and threw a handful of rocks at us! The rocks sailed right past Dean's nose, but hit me hard on the hand and knee as I sat quietly in the passenger side seat. I shouted to Dean frantically, ""Get out of here!""As we drove down the street, the homeless man continued to run after us, shouting obscenities and throwing more rocks at our car. Dean was able to snap a photo of the guy to report him to authorities. My leg and hand were bleeding by this point, and I urged Dean to get me home so I could apply bandages and antibiotics to the wounds. We debated reporting the incident to the police and Dean decided to call them the next day. I never suspected that the homeless crisis would ""hit me"" in such a literal and personal way.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K09HCY,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K09HCY,0.0,recalled

We searched through some kitchen shops looking for some fun gadgets and ingredients to cook with. Afterwards we went to some brewery tours and relaxed around town. We went on a bar crawl where we ate and drank through some nice restaurants. This moment was significant because it celebrated our relationship together.

I was sitting at the wooden kitchen table in my kitchen. I was eating peanutbutter toast. Suddenly, my heart stopped when I saw I had a notification from my dream genetics PhD program. After a second, I relaxed a bit, figuring it must be another survey or follow-up email they were sending regarding my place on the waitlist. However, when I clicked it I saw I was admitted to the program. The whole world stopped still. Everything I had worked hard for the past eight years was finally a reality. I sat there in silence for a moment, the spoon to my cereal in my hand, midair. After a couple moments of sitting in shock, I yelled out to my mother. She was getting ready for work and was a little annoyed when she entered the kitchen because I had interrupted her morning routine. When she saw my face, her mood lightened. I was crying tears of joy softly as I told her the news. I've never heard my mother shreak so loudly in my entire life. She ran across the kitchen and gave me a big hug. Tears of joys were running down her face as well. Everything felt just right as I continued to hug my mother and think positively about my future for the first time in a while.

It was a Tuesday morning and it was a fairly typical day. I was eating breakfast at my dining room table, preparing for my shift at work. I looked at my phone to check my email and was shocked to see an email from a graduate program I had been waitlisted at. The email told me I had been taken off the waitlist and was accepted to the program! I could hardly believe it. I felt like all my years of hard work had finally paid off. I had wanted to gain acceptance into this program since I was in high school and it felt as though all the time and energy I had dedicated to reaching my goals was now attainable. I was officially going to be getting my PhD in genetics! It was the first time in my life that tears of joy actually poured down my face. I was overcome with emotions and literally sat at my dining room table with the goofiest grin on my face and a feeling of sheer elation in my chest for fifteen minutes. I was going to be late for work but I did not care for it felt like my life was finally going somewhere. For the last six months, I had felt sort of lost, not really sure if my life was going to work out the way I wanted it to.. Finally, though, everything seemed to be working out for me. I giddily called for my mother, who was upstairs folding the laundry. She came downstairs and when she saw the look on my face, she was udderly confused. ""I got into a genetics PhD program!"" I yelled to my mother and the look of excitement and pride on her face made me even more happy.  A normally calm woman, she whooped and hollered at my success. I felt even happier knowing that I had made my mother proud.",3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH86BCZJZ,3AAJC4I4FHEJMZ2HTFMNPVH86BCZJZ,0.0,recalled

I was so surprised to get offered the job because I was not a perfect fit for it by any means.  I would have to learn a lot and pursue an additional degree.  My wife and daughter were excited about what lay ahead for us and the prospect of moving.  We relocated from NJ to TN and it was culture shock.  But exactly what we needed at that time.

He's a boxer, and I guess they are prone to eye problems. One day I noticed that his right eye had some cloudiness about it, and that his left eye had the same issue. I was immediately worried, because he is a part of the family. I took him to a specialist right away. The feeling of anxiety I experienced while in the waiting room was surprising. I've never owned a pet this long before, and I've never stopped to think about how much they start to matter to you. I might as well have been waiting to find out if my own child had cancer. My toe was tapping, and my mind was racing. When we finally got into the exam room I couldn't stop thinking about the worst possible outcomes. Luckily, my fears were unfounded. After running some tests on my pup the doctor told me that there was really nothing to worry about.

I've watched him grow from a puppy into a senior dog. I was extremely saddened when a strange discoloration appeared on one of his eyes recently. At first, I ignored it, but after it got larger I became a bit worried. When the discoloration spread to the other eye, I got very scared and made an appointment at the vet. I took him to his regular vet who quickly referred me to a specialist in the area. She said that he thought Milo had cancer in his eyes. I was extremely worried and apprehensive when she told me this and quickly made the specialist appointment. During the week long wait before the appointment I spent as much time with Milo as possible, in case the worst were to come to pass. When the day of the appointment came I took him there and they performed a bunch of tests. They stuck weird things in his eyes, looked at them through microscopes, and did a bunch of other things that neither he nor I enjoyed. When the vet left the room to process the data she had collected, I thought for sure she would come back and say he had cancer. I waited in fear, but she was smiling when she came back in the room. It turns out he had some cholesterol deposits in eyes. They are not dangerous and don't affect his vision. She said he can live just fine with them. I felt such relief and happiness when she told me that I wanted to hug her!",3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB36DPNT,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB36DPNT,0.0,recalled

We were so excited for our son to have a sibling. However, when we told our son the news he was not happy about it. We found out I was pregnant with a girl and we thought it might make it feel more real for our son knowing he would have a little sister. Despite our reassurances that we would still love him just the same, he was still upset about it. We thought he would warm to the idea as my pregnancy went on. But as it got closer to my delivery date, he was still saying that he didn't want a sibling. I was put on bed rest for the last couple weeks of my pregnancy. One day my water broke and we were off to the hospital. There were some complications with the delivery and I ended up needing an emergency c-section. It was a really scary experience, but my daughter was born healthy. When we brought our son in to meet his new little sister, he had a scowl on his face. He kept up his dislike for his sister for a few days. Eventually, he was won over by how cute she was. Now that my daughter is 3 years old, her brother loves her so much.

It was a planned c-section after a high risk pregnancy.  I was very excited to meet my new little girl but it was bittersweet.  This was my last pregnancy and although I was a tough one, I already knew I was going to miss the little details of carrying a child.  The small flutters that reminded you of the sweet baby in your belly, the wonder of seeing their kicks and movements, and the little gestures of kindness that are reserved for pregnant women were all things that I would never experience again.  I was also scared for the procedure.  With my first child, I had an emergency c-section so I didn't have time to stress about the whole surgery.  This time was different.  I worried about the things that could go wrong,  I didn't have the same confidence in my medical team that I had had with my first child.  I think my biggest concern was how my son was going to handle having a baby sister.  He was barely two.  I didn't know if he was going to be upset.  I was worried that he wouldn't feel loved and wanted.  When my husband brought him to my hospital room, I wanted him to feel just as important as he always had.  My son looked a bit alarmed at all the hospital equipment.   My husband brought him over to see the baby and he showed a bit of interest.  He stroked her hair and said ""baby"". That's when he leaned over to kiss the  baby on her head.  The whole room sighed at the cuteness of it.  Until the baby started screaming, that is.  Apparently, he was not as taken with his new little sister as we had hoped.  She had two tiny red marks on her forehead from where he bit her.  I had expected him to be unsure of the new baby but I never expected him to do that.  He then asked us to ""take her back, please"".  I think that was the beginning of a lifelong sibling rivalry.",3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBWWBPN0,,0.0,retold

It was the day that I lost my job. Started off with me waking up late for work. I end up ignoring my alarm clock and getting u late. I rush and brush my teeth and put on my clothes and drove off. Didn't get far and realize that I forgot my lunch. Drove back home, speeding, and ran inside and grab my lunch. Driving about 65 miles per hour, I end up getting stuck behind traffic. The line was so long that you couldn't see what was going on. All I know was that I was going to be late for work. I called my boss and he told me that I would be okay and have nothing to worry about. Stuck in traffic, I waited patiently and when I got closer I say that It was a truck stuck in a ditch. Eventually the truck got out and I was on my way. Got to work thinking everything was okay. But I knew something was wrong. The corporate manager kept walking by, staring at me through out the day. I can see her whispering to my manager. I ask one of the fellow employees did they hear anything. They said no that they think I'm okay. My boss calls me over and tells me that he needs me to sign paperwork at the front since the day was almost over, I could leave after this. Gather my stuff and walked with him to the front. Little did I know, It was the big boss in the office. Basically explained to me I was fired. Grab my stuff from the locker and walked out. Stayed in the car sitting there just thinking about my future and drove home.",3ATTHHXXWBAYMTIWAFD2G9MXA59XIF,,0.0,retold

It was a casual early morning around 4:45am, i was leaving for work at the same time I usually leave. When I made it about 10 min away from my crib i realize i forgot my lunch, so i turned around figuring since i always get to work about 20 min early I have time to spare. So i turned back and grab my lunch and headed to work. Then i saw it was a car accident on the highway and realize this is major setback. I couldn't see what it was. Waiting, I eventually get closer and see that its a 18 wheeler truck, stuck in a ditch. Something clicked in my head like this going to be one of the worst days of my life. I called my manager to give them a heads up on the situation and they told me I'll be okay, so I'm  thinking ""I should be okay and have nothing to worry about"". I arrived to work 15 min late, grab my work equipment and headed to my location. I start working and i could see the GM passing by me just about every 30-45 min. Now I'm scared cause he doesn't come around unless there's a problem. So I'm shiver-en and panicking. I ask one of my co workers who was close to the manager and they responded that I was okay and he hadn't heard anything. I'm guessing I'm good then. The day is almost finish and I get a call from the manager telling to gather my gear so i can complete a survey and leave. I didn't think much of it cause surveys are common at my job. I walk to the office and I'm there with him and the GM, they tell me to sit. I knew it was bad news due to the fact the GM was there. I sat and just thought ""Say it"". They said it with no hesitation and my heart froze for 5 seconds, I'm crying on the inside but on the outside acting like I'm okay. I'm walked out the building in front of peers who are just staring at me I'm feeling embarrassed and shameful. I gave them the key to the locker and shook there hands and left. Driving home thinking this day is something that really impact me. Got home and just sat in the bed looking a the  wall with a dull face thinking about ""What's next"".",3ATTHHXXWBAYMTIWAFD2G9MXA59XIF,,0.0,recalled

I have decided to through a birthday party for myself and my kids today.  They're birthdays are close to mine, so I figured we could all share the party this year, since no one was celebrating a milestone birthday.  I rented a lodge, and prepared decorations in the theme of Twin Peaks, as it's an important show in our family.  My children who are now 4 and 6 even request to listen to songs from the soundtrack during car rides.  I pride myself on throwing them very unique parties that other children would not have.  I bought doughnuts from the best place in town and and spent an entire day actually decorating the lodge.  I spent a month planning the proper decor and spent plenty of money on them.  All of this effort and at the last minute, my in-laws, who where half the guest list started calling that morning and giving reasons as to why they can't come.  All of them boiled down to that they just didn't feel like driving to our town.  My husband and I live an hour and a half from our home town.  I was so upset.  Here I was putting in all this effort into something that half the people on the list, who were family, couldn't even be bother to show up.  We made the best of it, our few friends in town came, and my parents and brother.  All in all it was a good little party and the kids never knew any different.  However, I was furious, and brokenhearted that family could so easily brush them off.  Anytime cousins on that side of the family have parties we are expected to haul our children over for the hour and a half drive, and I never even thought twice about it.

It was so lovely to see everyone and I could tell they were genuinely pleased to see me. There was a lot of catching up to do. My cousin had also recently had a baby so it was lovely ro be able to meet him for the first time. I also saw my old friends who I remain close to. I was also super grateful that I was able to see my dog again before it was her time to pass, I was quite shocked at how skinny and old she had gotten due to her bad health, her appetite just wasn't what it used to be and she looked much older than before. You could tell that she wasn't feeling herself but she still made the effort to come sit with me and seemed very happy that I was with her. I still think of her so often. she was one of those once in a life time dogs that has such a big personality and grows up with you. She was so full of life.

There was a great excitement and joy among us to see the preparations for the wedding celebration in our family. Decorations were made on the day before the marriage ceremony. A shrine was prepared for the celebration. It was also decorated with paper flowers. The canopy above the shrine was made of colored cloths. Another big canopy was put up in the open ground in front of our house. An electrician with his four assistants decorated the closed space with a number of multi-colored electric lamps. My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at-seven in the evening. First, the guests were served sweets and cold drinks. Many guests had brought different gifts for my cousin who was the bride. The marriage party members were very gentle. The groom was seated on a palanquin with thick garlands around his neck. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine.

My wife is due is the next 8 weeks and I am excited, anxious and everything in between. My wife and I were actually going to work on starting a family next year, however, it seems as though the universe had other plans. I was not sure at first how to feel about it but when I heard the baby's heartbeat for the first time, we were emotionally overwhelmed with joy. Hearing the heartbeat and seeing that little flicker of light on the screen was like staring at a star in space. It was a whole new experience for me as a person and seemed to remind me of the divine forces that work in our life sometimes. This new experience in my life also triggered so many other emotions, particularly the relationship with my family. My relationship with my family has been a roller coaster throughout my life and one of the most negative aspects in my life. The addition of a new baby seems to have bright some much needed positivity within my family but there is still some hesitation on my part to embrace my family. However, I do want my child to know their family and recognize how important that is. I have to remind myself that I need not project the failures of my parents on to my child and understand that those failures do not determine the quality of parent I am looking to be. My approach and mentality will be different. The situation my child will be born in to is already better than the one I was born in to. The changing of my priorities is scary but this is now my path. My baby's life is now at the forefront of my thinking and I must do everything in my power to ensure the life of this child can excel and prosper. This is my new normal and I look forward to learning many new things about myself and the world.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8GP9,0.0,recalled

I thought I needed to go to the ER in fact. It was the middle of the night. I didn't want to wake my significant other in case the symptoms passed. It was like I was having a heart attack, almost, however. I got up and went to the restroom where I just basically rested and tried to see if my shortness of breath would pass. It did after I remained calm and steady. I heard my fiance at the door, he woke up despite my trying to be quiet. He actually noticed I was in the bathroom for quite some time so he came looking to see if I was fine. This surprised me because he is usually a heavy sleeper. On this particular night he was not, which was a good thing! I was so surprised as he spoke to me in such a gentle way and not grumpy also. There have been a few times when he was not in a good mood when he did wake up suddenly for other reasons. After he saw I was okay we both went back to bed. We decided that I would make a Dr appointment in case something was still wrong. Then he went to work the next day as normal. When he came home later that evening he brought me a bouquet of roses which were my favorite! I was surprised and shocked. He had never done that before after finding out I wasn't feeling well. I think he was really changing his ways. I just might be able to spend my life with this man afterall.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8PGI,0.0,recalled

I was so nervous! not only was i leaving my first job ever but i was also going ot have to quit on people that i cared about. I spent days crafting how i would quit. I wrote it out before i met with people. After quitting, i started a new job. My new job is totally different than what i did before. I also am now working at a significantly smaller company.

I tagged along with a group of friends to Dorney Park. I was very reluctant but I went anyway. While there I avoided as much rides as I could but eventually my friends noticed and exposed me. I still resisted and went into defence mode until a close friend of mine gave me some words of encouragement that made me take the jump. I can't remember what they had said for some reason but I ended up enjoying myself a whole lot. Nothing can prepare you for the feeling you have when you're in a roller coaster. When you plunge down at high speeds, death almost feels inevitable. The force against your chest and the anxiety is so overwhelming. You have to go in with absolute faith in human machinery which is blind and foolish faith. Somehow the fear is what made the experience for me. After facing my fear and doing it anyway, I expected the worst. I think also looking around and seeing the looks on other people's faces made me feel better. Some were more scared than me it seemed and some were having an absolute blast. I chose to emulate the latter.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNEWEQPGI,,0.0,retold

I got there late which was an intentional delay on my part. I wasn't ready to face it. It was 3pm and I tried my best to avoid the roller coasters, only the individuals that I was fortunate to be in the company of were thrill seekers, in the highest sense. I was faced with two choices: to face my fears or stand alone. Of course, I stood alone. Not once, not twice, but three times until it became clear that I did not belong here. The separation I felt was immense. I had seen my friends go on these rides and come out unharmed and very satisfied, what was I afraid of? My closest friend gave me the nudge I needed. She said, ""Its fun because you're not in control."" I couldnt wrap my head around that but it made me curious. That is how my love for roller coasters began. There's nothing you can do to prepare your body for the resistance it feels when youre plunged downward at high speeds - nothing! It may be a simple event but it was very emotional for me, as I had come out of my comfort zone and I didnt regret it. I accepted that I cant always be in control and sometimes that's okay.",3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNEWEQPGI,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNEWEQPGI,0.0,recalled

My only wish was to be happy at when I get there and have a memorable birthday,when I got to the airport I took an uber to take me to the house. Soon I arrived home, I looked around with no idea of where every one was .the front door was open . I didn't like it. I became anxious and worried. I went upstairs and I met my sisters son . she said they all stepped out so we familiarized and I enjoyed her company because she was very funny. I felt like an her playmate for years. I sat down and closed my eyes. I remembered my old school, my old friends, my teachers and we all played when I was much younger like her. Suddenly my sister her mom walked up to me and screamed happy birthday and at that moment every one came out of their hiding position and I was shocked because I never expected such surprise. It was the best birthday ever and I wish to have such birthday again soonest. Everyone presented lots of gift to me and i was so happy and perplexed on what to say because i was confounded with the best words to use and explain my feelings.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,0.0,imagined

It was about a ten hour long car ride. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of road trips so a ten hour car ride is not that bad, or so we thought. His sister and her boyfriend seems like okay people to travel with, they were family so I was like why not. The first few hours were not to bad they were a little loud, almost like having children in the backseat. Then a couple more hours in to the trip their true colors started to show. They started to argue almost every second, which made the trip pretty miserable. They are also huge chain smokers so the ten hour trip gained a few hours due to the frequent stops and long stops for them to smoke their cigarettes. At every stop it would take them about thirty minutes to do their business. In the car it would just be moments of silence followed by yelling followed by making out. It was one of the most uncomfortable trips ever. At the wedding they got into more fights which only made the trip back home even worse. There was more fighting more yelling and due to their stress over arguing we needed to make more stops so that they could smoke even more. It was so uncomfortable, I could not even look to the back of the car because I did not want to see them either arguing with each other or making out. By the end of it I wanted to jump out of the car. Who knew that people in their twenty's could still act like teenagers.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,,0.0,retold

It was a very long and horrible drive with his family filled with smokers. We had to stop many many times which made the ride even longer. Once we arrived to the hotel we met the other part of his family which were even worse mannered than the ones in the car ride. My boyfriend and I tried to make the most of this trip and did great activities such as go to the new city we were in target and go swimming. Basically enjoy ourselves before the wedding. The next day we headed out to the wedding venue. Turns out it is a park in muggy muggy Texas. It was so hot but then it also started super late so we were dying there for a couple of hours. The afternoon we decided to get drinks at the hotel bar with the rest of the family and for some odd reason drama broke out between the siblings. It was really awkward and a really bad experience. Everyone after than would not talk to each other. The car ride back home was worse than the way there. They were arguing the whole time. At that point I realized no more trips with them. I only travel with my boyfriend alone.,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,0.0,recalled

When i first found out that i was receiving a promotion, i immediately called my wife to tell her the good news.  She was extremely excited, and we went out to dinner that night to celebrate.

I began to wonder what I'd do with my free time, and I was a little worried she didn't have an avenue to continue being a musician. But at our second to last performance, someone in the crowd requested one of her original songs. I didn't know how to play it, so I left the stage.

We had planned this week long vacation for several months in advance. It had been arranged so that we could visit relatives who live in the area. The morning we were to leave for our trip was very sunny so I woke up a few hours early from the light shining through my window. So, I used this extra time to finish packing my belongings that I had forgotten to pack the night before. We left around 9:30 on a warm, July Monday morning. It was a long trip and when we finally got there we were exhausted. So we decided to just rest and start out early the following morning. After that we went to Ride Niagara, a simulated ride over the Niagara Falls. It was rather realistic considering we never moved from a set position. After the ride, we met a French Canadian, who had a heavy accent and lived in Quebec. He helped us decide what attractions were worthwhile. After visiting a few of them we returned to the hotel worn out. On that Wednesday we rode on the Maid Of The Mist. When the boat reached close to the bottom of the falls everyone could feel the power of the falls by the incredible mist and loud roar of the falls. Later that day we went on a journey behind the falls, which took us through tunnels that actually opened up behind the falls. The lines for both these activities were very long so this took up most of the day. We spent another day visiting tourist attractions in that area. Then we decided to spend the rest of our time visiting our relatives. We saw many of our family members we haven? t seen in years. It was sad that we had to leave that Sunday, but we did. So we left for a long ride home with only the memories of our vacation.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D,,0.0,retold

While I was looking down on my phone to study, I felt the car jerk in a bad way and then looked up just to see us about to collide into the mountain. Luckily, my partner maneuvered the car in such a way where yes, we collided but we didn't completely disable us from getting back home. It was a horrifying time after going through such a great time. We continued driving, even though the headlight and bumper were almost wiped off the car. I remember him panicking and breathing funny due to anxiety. I can also remember the moment that we got home and it was such a relief, but it felt like it wasn't over yet. My partner still had to contact his parents and let them know about the car, and I still needed to finish studying for my exam.

It was an amazing sight to see and it was so beautiful with the lights and the crowd. On our way home, my partner was driving us down Route 87 when he lost control of the car and ended up crashing into the mountain, divider, and back into the mountain again. It was a horrifying experience and had we been on the other side of the divider, we could have potentially lost our lives. My partner continued to drive off because he felt like there was no stopping there. There were no lights and the risk of oncoming traffic was a lot scarier than the idea of continuing on. Everything was going fine until the crash. I had just been looking down at my phone to study for the final I would have the following day, and felt the car slide before the crash. After we arrived back at my place, I helped my partner get into bed and woke up in pain the next day. I believe I experienced whiplash. My shoulders, neck and back were in so much pain that I barely got out of bed. Later that night of the following day, I coughed up some blood. For the past few months, I've been suffering more migraines and tinnitus. Overall, it was a horrible situation but I had to deal with the hand that I was dealt. Today, I am much more careful and aware of what is going on when on the road. If my partner is tired, I tell him to get some rest before we do anything. I feel so lucky to be alive and reflect on it often. It definitely made me appreciate my life a little more, especially when the mechanic was so surprised to see the car's condition and then us. I also discovered tired driving can be worse than drunk driving. Even if you aren't under the influence, tiredness impairs you. It's important to not be ignorant when behind the wheel. It's also important to not be aware, even if you aren't behind the wheel. It could take warning the driver verbally to save your lives or prevent an accident.

The Who are his favorite band of all time, and we have always communicated best through discussing our mutual love of music. Since my mother passed away two years ago, we talk almost every day. So when he said he wanted to fly me to Miami to see the Who, I was startled and excited. They weren't playing here in Phoenix, but I had always wanted to see them. Plane tickets aren't cheap, and let's just say that he got us such good seats that the tickets were more expensive than the flight! My mother had been a fan of the Who, as well, but she and I only attended one concert together. That had not been a good time, because I really hate Jimmy Buffett, and she was disappointed in his performance. We had always talked about going to see the Who or Bob Seger as a family, but it never happened. So, in a way, not only was I getting to bond with my father, but I also managed to find a way to honor plans my late mother and I had made. Watching the show was fine. They put on a great show. But, more importantly, my father and I had the fun of attending a concert together and sharing a special moment.  He got to share his most beloved band and I got to see the glow on his face.

I was treated in the hospital for the sypmptoms and after four days and transferred to a rehab hospital to regain strength and stability.  While in the rehab facility I developed a staph infection in the surgical incision which progressed into my blood stream and turned septic.  This infection made me incredibly weak and delirious.  I was transferred back to the hospital where my surgery was done and a second surgery was performed to clean the infection out of the incision and area of the surgery.  I was placed on an antibiotic IV drip and transferred back to the rehab center.  I was in the rehab center for another 3 weeks while recovering, and was finally released to go home.  I still am recovering from the residual effects of the incident, and have pain and weakness in my leg.  I think about the incident every time I stand up and feel the instablilty and pain in my leg.

I see a cardiologist every 3 months so that he can monitor any heart issues which may have been aggravated by the infection.  I see a Kidney specialist every 3 months to monitor kidney functions that have been impaired by the infection.  I see an infectious disease specialist to monitor the infection and its abatement.  I see a specialist for my arteries every 6 months to monitor any affects that may be going on with my arteries.  I see my primary care doctor every 3 months to coordinate everything going on with the other doctors.  To say the least this is rather monotonous going back and forth to all of these doctors.

However we did not see much benefit from that necessarily.  We moved her to an adult doctor and the doctor prescribed an anti-depressant for her.  Initially we did not see much change.  But after about 6 weeks on the medicine, it was like she was a new child.  She was getting her school work done, enjoying her job, not hiding in her room,  etc..  She got involved all on her own with a college group at a local church as our church doesn't have one.  She started spending time at the barn again.  She is so much easier to be around now.  She talks and laughs with us and is generally in a good mood, even though school still stresses her out from time to time.

We've tried many different counselors, prayed over her, prayed for her, but nothing was working.  We finally agreed to let her try some medication.  While I was very concerned about giving an anti-depressant to a 19 year old child, we were kinda at our wit's end.  Living with her had gotten to the point that the entire house was on edge.  She was either asleep or yelling at us or ignoring us or being rude and nasty to every person in the house.    So the event I'm talking about happened about 6 weeks after she started taking the medication.  One day I realized that she'd come home from work and we'd had a 20 minute conversation in which she was lively, animated, and actually laughed.  I started realizing that she wasn't near as rude or mean or nasty as she used to be.  When I asked her to take out the trash, she just did it.  Without arguing, without putting it off and then forgetting, without any complaining, this was unheard of.  I was praising God and thanking Him for the nudge to try the medication with her.  It has changed her world, and therefore ours as well.  Recently she received word that although she got into her favorite college, she would not be able to go as the cost of room and board was just too much and we didn't feel like she should be drowning in student loan debt.  She was understandably upset but after about 10 minutes she started making other plans that involve living at home and going to a great school locally.  This would have never happened before the medication.  She would have retreated to her room and been in there for days, it would have crushed her, ruined her life in her eyes, and caused such upheaval that it would have taken weeks if not more for her to get back to baseline.  I'm beyond grateful for the advances in science, the doctors that know how to work with patients, and the God that provided for us all.",3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAHUA65,3BV8HQ2ZZXN6XWF2X4CZZYLUAHUA65,0.0,recalled

I was unsure if she had anything to do with the reason I was called to the front of the ER. The woman introduced herself to me and asked if I remembered her. Awkwardly, I told her I did not recall meeting her in the past. She told me that I had saved her life several months ago. She told me that she had come in for an overdose and almost died. I immediately remembered everything about the day I saw her. She was depressed and overdosed on several very toxic medications. She required a breathing tube and mechanical ventilation. She required infusions to artificially increase her blood pressure and another infusion to fix the acid/base balance in her blood. After over a week in the intensive care unit, she was stabilized and successfully discharged. She told me that since then, she has reconnected with her family, gone back to school, and has recently been hired for a new job. She came by to thank me. I was speechless. This brought tears to my eyes.",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA7K7MU9,,0.0,retold

This event occurred a few days ago. I was called overhead to the front of the Emergency Department. When I arrived there, I was greeted by a woman holding a plant. She then said, ""I don't know if you remember me , but you saved my life."" She went on to explain that she was seen there several months prior after overdosing on several dangerous medications. Looking back on the case, it was very difficult from both a medical standpoint and an emotional standpoint. She has to have a breathing tube and a large catheter in her neck. She required medciations to artificially raise her blood pressure. She was in the ICU for over a week. She was eventually able to be discharged. I had not seen or heard from her since the event.

It was held at a social organization's building both inside and outside.  I imagine that about 100 people were there.  Tons of food and drinks, lots of games to play.  After the sun went down and most of the family had left, a small group of us went over to my great aunt's house where my uncle played his guitar and we all stomped our feet, clapped our hands.  That is probably my most vivid memory.  That was in 1986. Well, fast forward to 2019 and my attempts at reviving the Davis family reunion.  Obviously, many of those who attended 33 years ago have since passed away.  And you would think that with today's technology, like Facebook, it would be easy to track down long lost relatives.  Nope!  I was having to glean information from immediate relatives for phone numbers and looking at old photographs and determining who people were, how they were related to one another.  We had the reunion back in August, but I had started the process back in February, basically trying to get the word out.  A lot of prep work went into putting it together, getting a hall rented (thank you American Legion!), buying food and drinks, borrowing tables, chairs, a canopy, cornhole boards.  We even brought our own gas grill.  We had so much stuff to bring to the reunion that I had to rent a 15 foot Uhaul!  We had approximately 35 people attend.  I was hoping for a few more to show up, but all in all I was satisfied with how things turned out.  Some of my cousins want to do it every year, but others have said that every other year would be better.  So I have already began mental preparations for the 2021 Davis Family Reunion!",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA8MIMUP,,0.0,retold

I'm 46 years old and I rememeber the 1986 Davis reunion as it was held at the Brewster Gun Club in Brewster, Ohio.  If I were to guess, I would say that there were at least 50 people there, possibly more.  I can't say for sure, because no photo was taken.  The other Davis family reunion was in 1973 and was held at the American Legion in Beach City, Ohio, which is about five miles south of Brewster.  I was only five months old and obviously don't remember it.  But, a group photo was taken and my cousin Shawna has me in her lap.  Well, fast forward to February 2019.  I got to thinking about the Davis family tree and thought it was about time someone put together a long-overdue reunion.  Thanks to Facebook, I was able to reach out to several relatives, and even discovered a few more that were out of state.  It would have been cool to have it at the aforementioned Brewster Gun Club, but it no longer exists.  It has been replaced by an apartment complex.  BUT, the Beach City American Legion was still in existence so I got ahold of the commander and he was more than happy to have us rent out the place.  The cost was only $150 which I thought was appropriate.  My wife and I probably spent a good 80-90 percent of the overall cost of the reunion.  A good chunk of that was renting a U-Haul truck because of all the tables, chairs and barbecue grill.  That, and the reunion was 85 miles from our house!  Needless to say, it was a lot of work getting the reunion set up and of course, taking it down and cleaning up.  We left our house at 6am and didn't get home till midnight. The reunion itself had about 35 people attend, some of which I hadn't seen since the last reunion in 1986!  There were a few that weren't in attendance that I would have loved to have seen.  Just seeing old relatives reconnecting after so many years almost brought a tear to my eye.  My one cousin wants to do a reunion every year, but I am thinking maybe every two years.  Especially if it's going to be my wife and I who put it together!",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA8MIMUP,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA8MIMUP,0.0,recalled

My stepson has two jobs and is finishing high school online. I have been surprised that we have been getting along well. Also he now has a dog that we found and she loves him. We were able to turn our home office into a bedroom. His having a room has work out nicely. We hope that all continues to go well. Our goal is that he can work himself into independence.

Me and my partner live alone in our two bedroom house on 2 and a half acres. My stepson had not seen his father in 3 years. Now that he is 19 he wanted to make the choice about where he lived now. He asked if he could stay with us. I felt put on the spot and did not want to say no. I said yes but I have found the adjustment to having a child back in the house to be hard. Both of my children are out of the house and on their own. They are a couple of years older than my stepson so they are further along in life than he. He is a couple of years behind in development and it is like having a teenager in the house again. But a large part of me wants him and his father to have that time to get to know each other again. Also he needs to be with people who encourage his independence instead of smothering it. All in all It is stressful but also in the long run probably for the best that he has come to live with us.

My daughter and I were involved in a car accident on a morning that was already not so pleasant. I had barely gotten any sleep the night before because I had been up crying my eyes out. My cousin (who is more like a brother to me) had been involved in a very terrible car accident and was on life support. My emotions were everywhere. I gathered my daughter because I didn't want her to be late going to school. Once I got in my truck, I realized that it would not start. I had to call my mother to borrow her BRAND NEW truck, which she had just purchased two weeks prior. She came to my house and I dropped her off at her house and was making my way to my daughters school. On the four way highway, my daughter and I were in the left lane. The light turned green and I then realized that a car ahead of me was making a left turn and yielding oncoming traffic. I turned on my signal light to get into the right lane since there was no traffic coming behind me. As soon as I switched over and started to move past some of the other cars in the left lane. As I was passing the cars that were in the left lane, one of the cars came over in the right lane hitting me and my daughter. I was knocked off of the road and onto the sidewalk. I had to stay there for a moment because my daughter was yelling and screaming and my nerves were shook. I was able to move the truck from off the sidewalk and park behind the young lady who hit me and police were called. My nerves were so shaken up because I had got into an accident and for one moment my whole life flashed before my eyes, was I about to end up like my cousin?? I was also worried about the fact that I had crashed my mom's new truck which was her first concern when I called her; leaving my child and I as an afterthought. With my daughter in my arms trying to comfort her, I began to cry. Everything was going wrong in my life at this moment, and I had no one. The young lady who hit me had called her older sister there to be with her; meanwhile I had no one. I texted my boyfriend who was at work, but he gets no service in certain places..... everything was a mess. However, the young lady was very nice and offered to pay for all of the damages because she was a new young driver who didn't want to increase her insurance. Her sister saw how upset I was and gave me a hug which turned out to be very comforting. It turns out the sister worked at the local hospital and remembered seeing the ambulance bringing my cousin in the day prior. She sent her love and prayers to my family and my daughter and I went to the hospital to be examined; my daughter was fine, I had minor aches for a few days, and my cousin died three weeks later",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHQPGPDR,0.0,recalled

For the past six years I was the caretaker for my sick, elderly mother. She had been in and out of various hospitals due to her illnesses. Although I knew it would be a difficult undertaking, because I was really close to her, I decided that I would take care of her full time. We moved in together and I took care of her daily needs. However, I had to watch as her condition started to slowly get worse. She began to lose her ability to walk and was forced to use a wheelchair. And next, her mental capacity began to deteriorate as well. Still, I tried my best to care for her and to give her an enjoyable life, like she deserved. There were ups and downs to the whole situation, but I thought that overall everything was under control. That was until unexpectedly, one day, she needed me to call an ambulance for her. That was the last time I was able to speak to her. She was rushed to the hospital, and had to be put into a medically induced coma, from which she never woke up from. Losing her was such an unexpected event in my life. Suddenly I felt more alone than I had ever been. Nothing could have prepared me for this situation, and even now, I still am feeling the effects. To say that I feel sad about the situation is an understatement. I wish that I could have her back, even for a short while.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHF7VYUA,0.0,recalled

We went in and we stayed there about half of the day because we didn't have any swim clothes so the clothes we had got soaked pretty early. Next time i want to plan it out ahead of time so we have everything we need. I will write it down in the calender at least a month in advance. We will look up the weather, and we will pack clothes accordingly. I didn't remember to take diapers the last time either. So, diapers are definitely a must, along with wipes for the kids. Other than diapers and clothes, i would probably take toys for the baby as well. A stroller would be great, too. Basically i would need to have all the essentials for my kids in order to stay and have fun all day long.

We did get two free skip the line tickets each though, so that worked out okay for the most part. We also got some fries with cheese to eat, and the cheese was the best thing ever!

His brother, now 3 years old, had just completed his second year in the spring and had now moved on to his next program elsewhere. My wife and I were very excited to see our youngest get to experience the school and its teachers, but we were also nervous because the temperment of both boys has shown they are very different. Our oldest is adventurous to the point of being reckless. He is now very self-sufficient and communicates his needs. Our youngest tends to be very needy, and clings to me and his mother. We had flashbacks to the first few days of dropping off our other son and he would cry terribly at first. We had our youngest all dressed and his bag packed with changes of clothes, diapers, and blankets for napping with. We drove on the expressway through downtown and tried to explain what he could expect from the day. We tried to tell him that he would be meeting his new teachers and that he would get to do new activities, read stories, and meet new friends. And then we would be ready to pick him up soon. When we got to school, we parked out front and I helped get him out of his car seat. We had him walk on the sidewalk, holding my hand, and he held onto his own lunchbox. We took a moment to pose him in front of the school's sidewalk sign (the same place we snapped a picture of our other son on his first day). Spirits seemed high, so we entered the classroom. It was busy, yet quiet - several other families were sitting near the cubbies getting their kids to change into their indoor shoes, hang up their belongings, and part ways. Our son seemed to take to it, but was definitely clinging close to us. When it was time for us to go, we led him to the entrance of the classroom and had him hold hands with one of his teachers who led him to where the other children were. He looked back at us with tears in his eyes and started bawling. We knew it would be better to make a quick exit, rather than prolong this. We got back in the car with mixed emotions and drove off. By the time I had arrived to work, the teacher had shared out a picture of our son doing a few of the activities at school. He looked a bit weapy, but was smiling in the pictures and I remember that making me feel so good for him and glad that he was safe, happy, and cared for.",3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF787MPKT,,0.0,retold

His is very much attached to his mom and I, so we were nervous for him being away from us. We figured his natural curiosity would carry him through the day until we would pick him up in the afternoon. We were wrong! The drop-off was tough. We were supposed to bring him in to his cubby, change his shoes to his slippers, and then help walk him over to the gate of his classroom. We saw the wheels turning in his mind - he knew what was happening and he didn't like it. The tears started as soon as he heard other kids starting to cry. He didn't want to let go of us and he looked like he could not understand why were leaving him with the teachers at the school. We were told that we should make a quick exit upon dropping off, so as to not prolong the experience for him, but it was difficult! After we got back to our car and were on our way home, we saw that the teacher had sent us a picture of him in the classroom, already taking an interest to some of the class materials and activities for him. The day was long and when we went to pick him up that afternoon, he looked worse for wear! Even though he looked relieved to see us he started to cry again. The teacher told us he had a fine day and that every day would get a little easier. We trust her, but the process has been difficult so far! It's hard to drop him off (now on his second week) knowing that it is so emotionally upsetting to be left at school in the morning!",3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF787MPKT,3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF787MPKT,0.0,recalled

About seven weeks ago, Henry, started Kindergarten.  It was his first day of elementary school, and since he is my oldest child, it was my first day of Kindergarten as well.  We woke up a little bit early that day to make sure that we had plenty of time to get ready.  When I woke up my son, you could tell that he was excited but nervous about starting school.  We began our morning with a big hug, and then I started helping him get ready.  We had already picked out his clothes the night before, so he got dressed while I made him a special breakfast.  By the time that he was dressed, it was time to eat.  We sat at the kitchen table and ate pancakes together, while his brother and sister were still sleeping in their beds.  After eating, he brushed his teeth and combed his hair, while I got his siblings out of bed and dressed.  At this point, it was time to head outside to wait for the bus.  We all stood at the end of the driveway and stared down the street looking for the big yellow school bus.  Soon we could see it driving down our street.  I looked into my son's eyes, and I could see that he was starting to get nervous again.  We all gave him a big hug, as the school bus pulled up.  He started climbing up the stairs and turned around to look back at us.  I snapped a couple of pictures as he disappeared into the vehicle.  He sat down in one of the seats next to a window and we all waved goodbye.  Tears filled my eyes as the bus pulled away, not because I was sad but out of pride and love for my son.",3COPXFW7XCYKJF6TOROXZCF7B1IKPB,,0.0,retold

Really an empty lot that used to be a house and someone's property. The neighborhood kids all gather there to play while parents chit chat and hang out. Several people were shot. It was very traumatic for all of us. We no longer feel safe letting the kids play outside. Most of the time we feel safe but here lately it hasn't felt like a very safe place to live. There has been times that some of the neighbors have not gotten along, to the point of physical fighting. Most don't even talk to each other now.

This morning of the funeral, we all met in the parking lot of the funeral home. Hesitant to go inside, we stayed out in the lot for a while, drinking and sharing memories of our times with Brian. It was great to see so many old friends all in one place again. Unfortunately, the reality of why we were all together again was painful. We continued telling stories and laughing outside until it was time for everyone to go in. I was brought into a different room with the rest of the pallbearers and given our instructions. My good friend gave a really powerful eulogy.  We all carried the casket outside afterward and eventually slid it into its final resting spot in the mausoleum. Afterwards, many hugs and tears between friends and family. A few of us from out close friend group when we were kids decided to go out to a restaurant together afterward in order to spend more time together. This was very helpful in healing.

This year marked the first of my college career in which I decided to spend in the same city as my University as opposed to going home for the break. As a result, I was able to celebrate it with the colleagues I had grown to love over the past five years of school. That same day, there was an NBA finals game going on. The plan was to either go to a bar to watch the game, or to go out on the town later that night. I had decided that we would go to the game as that is what most of the group was willing to do. We all made mistakes in that we went to drink beers, but did not think to eat much beforehand. Everyone at the table ordered a pitcher except for me, and we started the night by pouring a pint and chugging it. This was probably the most memorable part of the night as it was nice to get the cheers and wishes from the people I consider my best college friends. Since it was my birthday, I was never actually able to finish a pint as people kept topping me off. We stayed at this bar for a few hours, and to be honest, I have very little recollection of the game that was played at all. While we all had a few drinks in us, one of my roommates brought up the idea of getting tequila shots to drink at home. Being as drunk as we were, we all agreed. We payed our bills and walked across the street to a Trader Joe's to buy liquor. When we went home, we all took shots. That was when it was eventually decided that everyone now wanted to go out on the town as they did not want the night to end. We took a few more shots, and Ubered to Pacific Beach. My next memory is waking up in my bathroom with the toilet filled with vomit. I cleaned up and walked upstairs to see two of my roommates passed out on the couch still wearing their clothes from last night. It was only about 4 AM, so I went to bed and dealt with the hellish hangover for the rest of the day.",3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWRSU9NQ,,0.0,retold

I had a great time at that bar, minus the fact that I did not eat much while there, so I was very intoxicated. Upon leaving the bar, one of my roommates decided it was a good idea to stop at Trader Joe's to buy a fifth of tequila. Looking back, this was a bad idea, but at the time, no one objected. It was my birthday and everyone just wanted to go wild. After arriving back home from the bar, we began taking shots of the tequila. It was very fun and we had some good electronic music playing in the background. Apparently, we ended up going back out to Pacific Beach and bar hopping. Unfortunately, I do not recall this at all as I blacked out after the second or third shot. Luckily, I woke up in my bed unharmed and did not do anything stupid.

I was finally able to go on my dream vacation!  Paris and London were the most amazing places.  So much more magnificent that I could have even dreamed.  I went with Matt, Marcus, Joseph and of course the love of my life, Stacy.  We first flew in to Paris and stayed there for four days.  The first day we went sightseeing and we went to the Eiffel Tower.  We had to pay just to go to the top, which was irritating, but it was worth it once we got there.  At the top, I got down on one knee and asked my amazing girlfriend if she would do me the honor of becoming my wife.  She said yes and Joseph was able to get it all on film!  We've watched that recording 10 times at least, lol.  That just started our trip off on such a high that the rest of the time in Paris was fantastic.  We ate in quaint little local spots and had such great service everywhere we went.  After Paris we took the train to London and spent the last three days there.  It was just as amazing as Paris.  I loved visiting the historical landmarks and Big Ben was too cool!  Stacy and I have decided to go back to Paris for our honeymoon, we loved it that much!",,3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO95GG7J1,0.0,imagined

We talked about many things while we were there, and we found out many new stories about our friends. We haven't seen them in a while. So it was nice catching up. After we talked for a while, we went to the beach to have some fun. We swam in the oceans, and we played in the sand. We had a great time. It was fun, and we loved it a lot.

She had a really hard time with it at first and we were just shocked that it was taking her so long. She was not born early by any means but it seemed like she was developing at a slower pace than most babies. For the longest time she would just crawl on her belly and push herself with her legs instead of attempting to get on to her knees. I had been spending time with her trying to get her to get up on her knees at least because i had remembered my son would get on his and rock a little. I felt like it was normal and she should be doing this. so for the last few months when i would see her doing her belling crawling i would race over and try to put her on her knees and see if she would attempt to crawl or at least stay up for a period of time. so after weeks of this not working and seeing no progress i just gave up. i had decided that i would let her develop this skill on her own. Well a couple of weeks ago she decided that she was going to get on her knees and crawl all in the same day! i was playing with her in the living room and had to go to the other room to assist my oldest child with something. when i looked down at the ground near my feet there she was. she had decided that she didnt want to wait for me to get back and crawled to me instead. it was one of the happiest times because all of the worry and frustration had been worth it. i was so proud of her because i had just let her develop on her own and she crawled in her own time.,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO7A26UZ,3D8YOU6S9F6QC5T039TQZZXO7A26UZ,0.0,recalled

Everything about the wedding was perfect. The wedding was on the beach and the weather couldn't be any more perfect. The food and decorations were perfect and the music kept us all dancing all night long. We had a lot of laughs. I think the funniest moment was when she went to smash some cake in the groom's face, but missed when he ducked and threw it on the floor.  She gave the entire place a good laugh. There were many candid photos taken and shared between all of us. We are still reliving the day as we look through the pictures. I know my cousin had an amazing wedding and I'm so happy that we could all help share in her special day.  The bride looked beautiful and her wedding party complimented her perfectly.

Just getting to put the dress on made her happy. It was clear how excited she was about getting married. My friend and I had first met way back in seventh grade, when we had some classes together. We'd seen each other through a lot of important life moments, like first boyfriends, first heartbreak, high school graduation, college acceptance and the birth if her first child. Getting to be with her for this step was important to me. She looked happy and radiant in her dress and it made me think back to when we met fourteen years ago as kids. There was something so neat and intimate about getting to be with her while she did this sort of prep work for the big day. A lot of people would be at her wedding, but it was just the two of us sharing excitement at this appointment. I liked being able to see her excitement and nerves about the upcoming day. It reminded me of how excited and nervous she had been when she started dating her soon-to-be husband. It was a special moment to get to share with a close friend.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU3WO5N6,,0.0,retold

Its crazy to me how the court let it go on as long as they did, especially considering there was proof of abuse. The children's mother has gone off the deep end, and started using drugs again. I talk to her mother often, so the kids can see their grandmother. She keeps me in the loop with what's going on. Thanks to me now having full custody, I can move wherever I want, and place the children in any school I want. At the end of the year, we may decide to move in order for me to pursue better career options. Since getting full custody the kids have been great. My one son is doing really well in school, and behavior issues have stopped. The mother calls every once in a while, but unfortunately the kids are not all that interested in talking to her. Its become difficult to force them to talk to her, especially since she never sticks to a schedule when calling them.

This was a very emotional moment for me because I fought for my children for three years, and as a father looking to gain custody of his children it was very difficult. My children were being abused by their mother, and no matter how much proof I provided the courts, they still allowed her to have primary custody of the children. I have never used drugs in a my life, yet the children's mother was using regularly (that's why we separated) for three years. In order to get ""just"" three weekends a month with my kids, I was forced into taking drug and alcohol tests, anger management, etc.. During this time their mother would routinely violate the order that allowed me to see the children on the weekends. She would curse at me, threaten me, tell me I was trash, all right in front of the children. There was a small period where I honestly started to believe the things she would say to me, almost as if I had accepted that I was trash, even though I was doing everything right. I guess after a while I just started to break down, I was constantly in debt due to the cost of lawyers, and was just mentally drained. Thankfully I had my family to pick up the the pieces for me, and my children to keep motivating me. In January of 2019, their mothers neighbour called children and youth on her, and abuse was found to be taking place in the home, and in the end custody was removed from her, and given to me. The amount of relief I experienced is not measurable. The day I received the order signed by a judge, I just remember breaking down and crying. I dont think I will ever forget that day. Even though I was able to gain full custody of the children, I still hold sort of an resentment against the legal system. I honestly do believe if I was not a man trying to gain custody of his children, and the roles were reversed, it would have taken less than six months. I mean from the very beginning I had proof of the abuse taking place, and the courts just did not care. My children are safe, and happy today though. I could not ask for more than that.",3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TUE87,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TUE87,0.0,recalled

She is not as strong or as active as she has been, so she went to the doctor. They ran a bunch of tests on her to figure out what was wrong. We knew that her circulation was poor, but were not expecting to get the results we did. The medical team injected dye into her veins and ran a stress test. This was to show her blood flow, as well as to get an idea of the condition that her body was in. This test took an entire day, and we waited almost a week to find out the results. The tests showed that her heart was not functioning as it should be. This test also showed that three of her arteries were severely blocked. They recommended that she have open heart surgery, otherwise she was at risk for a stroke or heart attack. She didn't want to do this, so we convinced her to at least consider getting stents put in. She took the initial results to her doctors in the city she'd lived in prior to moving, and they agreed that the stents were a good start, and absolutely necessary. This surgery was scheduled, and my boyfriend took time off from work to go down to be with her for the procedure. The hospital she went to was the third place she'd been, and the doctor was very honest. He told my boyfriend and his sister that there was a good chance his mother could die on the table, due to the condition of her heart. This wasn't easy to hear, but they appreciated the honesty. So they took her back for the surgery, and after almost an hour, the doctor came back and told my boyfriend and his sister that the initial results had been wrong and there were no blockages at all, that the scope had showed them that she was in good health. She didn't need any surgery, and the whole procedure could have been avoided if the initial doctors hadn't screwed up the results like they had.",3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9F46A,,0.0,retold

She went to the doctor's to get cleared for a hip surgery, and they did some sort of stress test and found that she had some arterial blockages. She went for further testing, and they found that she needed to choose between having open heart surgery to clear the blockages or put stents in to improve the situation. This news impacted me because it really impacted my boyfriend, and made me think about when my dad was sick a few years ago. His mother didn't want to have surgery, and said that if it was her time to go, it was her time to go. She eventually (July) chose to have the stents put in, and went to a second doctor's appointment, where the information was relayed... and they basically told my boyfriend, his sister, myself and his mother that there was a good chance she'd have a stroke on the operating table based on the initial results. To make a long story short, she still went in for the surgery at the end of August, but when they put the scope in for the stents, they found that there was no blockage as described - and that she didn't need to have the surgery. The doctor was astounded at how different the truth was from what was shown on the initial testing. This impacted me again because it meant that we'd been worrying for months about nothing. It made me realize that getting a second opinion is always necessary, because sometimes even medical professionals can make mistakes - that result in unnecessary worries for people for months, as well as end of life planning that doesn't need to be done. It made me scared, it made me sad, and it made me mad. I we were preparing for the worst for nearly 3 months, and it turned out that none of it was necessary. I'm always going to think about this when I go in for medical procedures and appointments now. Medical professionals might be able to help a lot of people, but in this case, they didn't at all. His mom was just stressed for months, the whole family was stressed, and it was what we thought was a race against time - even though it wasn't.",3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9F46A,3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9F46A,0.0,recalled

I was driving my Ford Explorer down a windy road when a deer leapt out in front me. In an attempt to swerve around the deer, I jerked my steering wheel hard to the right towards a turn down a side street. However, the speed I was going at and the weight and unwieldiness of my car made me go careening off towards a house. With no real course of action at this point, luck had me slip directly in between two trees in this persons front yard, coming close enough to one to take off my side view mirror. Then a sharp ditch by their driveway slowed my vehicle enough to come to stop with little damage. Coming out of this, I had 3 of my 4 tires popped, a broken side view mirror, and a shattered window; but luckily no injuries myself. This has been on my mind nearly constantly since then, how differently it could have gone. I did lose my car, but I could have very easily lost my life. Or worse yet, I could have careened into that poor persons house and caused the death of someone else. After the accident the startled residents of the home came out to make sure I was ok. After sharing exasperated bewilderment at the luck of the scenario, I called a tow truck. The residents of the home were nice enough to offer me water and sit with me till the police and tow truck showed up. Luckily I have a bit of cash saved up for purchasing a new car, and hopefully my insurance premiums don't go up too much. Going forward its going to be hard to drive without the constant anxiety of another rogue deer deciding my fate. But I am very grateful that things didn't turn out worse.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZNCNVSA,0.0,recalled

I was very angry with my parents for going to immediate care and then ignoring the doctor's instructions to take an ambulance to the hospital. My father drove her and they acted like it wasn't a big deal. After my mom was admitted I basically stayed at the hospital until she had her heart cath the next day. The doctor told us it would take about 30 minutes and if it took more than 45 minutes it means they found something wrong. After an hour we were certain that something was seriously wrong with my mom. After an hour and a half the doctor came out to tell us that they found a 99% blockage and had to put in a stint.

When we arrived it was quite beautiful, it was raining but that did not stop the fun. We seperated into groups of 6 or 7 and went down the river with a river guide. We made a couple stops to swim and do waves with the boat. It just proved to everyone that it was possible to have fun in sobriety. It was an unforgettable day for all involved. I do have a vivid memory of people flying out of the boat and seeing them pulled back in. It was the entire staff from the mens and womens houses so although it was a work trip - it was the same as being out with a group of close friends.

It was the event I had the most fun with this year. I went with my clients from work and also some coworkers. It was at a river about 3.5 hours away from where we live. It was a very memorable experience. I work at a halfway house for men being released from jail/prison with substance use issues, and it is privately ran by a church and there is another house under the same church for women, which is our sister house. I have never been white water rafting before but my girlfriend has and both of my parents have been. I have been wanting to do something fun like this for a while because it has been a while since I did something extraordinary. The car ride was long but worth it and the day started out nice and warm, but as soon as we got to the destination, the temperature dropped and clouds started rolling in. The destination was also northeast farther upstate. When we arrived, we all changed and checked in. We had 2 vans full, 1 for each house, and about 2-3 car fulls of people as well. Everyone put life vests on and either wet suits or wet shoes. We all headed out to the water after teams were made and we got into our assigned boats. Each boat had an instructor who taught us how to paddle and when, by his direction. It started to rain as soon as we got in the water and it was only about 50-55 degrees fahrenheit. I'm running out of time for this study but the rapids were extremely high and fast for the season. It was a crazy experience and I almost fell out of the raft a couple times, and some people who I know did fall out. We took a break halfway through and after it was done, the workers grilled food for the people who rafted.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGHQPN,0.0,recalled

I remembered about 5 years when i got admitted for my studies. I was to study Agriculture from University of Los Angelos. I was glad to take this opportunity. All effort was made so i can get the best result i could.  I attended all my classes and did all my assignments and projects. 4 years later i graduated as the best student in my college. The graduation ceremony which took place a year ago was a memorable one for me. What made it memorable was that i swept all the award of my college. My parents were overjoyed at the success of their kid. My joy couldn't be contained.  I'm so glad that all my efforts were not wasted. I will always tell my kids about this day to inspire them to put all their efforts in whatever they do. I learnt that i can be whoever i want to be as long as i'm focused and dedicated. I will be glad to share my story with the world.,,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWDXI1I1,0.0,imagined

It was the first book, where I was listed as the editor, and the first project that I had complete responsibility over in the workplace. It had to do with women's experiences with sexual harassment and assault. It was a project that was important too me not only because it is important subject matter, but it was the most diverse project that had been brought up in the workplace. Most of our projects are from the perspective of straight white men.  Partnering with a designer that I work with, we conceived of the overall idea together. I curated the artists and was responsible for coordinating the project from inception to the actual release. It was an extremely taxing project, but rewarding in the end. It had the participation of so many incredible female illustrators and I was thrilled they all wanted to be part of the project. A few days before the actual release, one of the artists announced the project early on their social media. They happened to be one of the more prominent artists, and that led to a lot of buzz that we were not entirely prepared for. So we had to scramble to announce the project early, since it would otherwise have impacted potential sales. It was really incredible to see all the posts on social media that were about the project, and it was amazing to see how popular it was on our own social channels, in comparison to our other posts. It showed how valuable it is to have diverse voices that are concerned with social issues. While it has not been the career burst I am may have hoped for, it has led to some very cool opportunities. I received some freelance writing jobs for myself, and our book has been featured in a few websites and magazines. It is definitely something I am proud to put on my resume and personal achievement  list.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWDXI1I1,,0.0,retold

I edited the whole thing and conceived the whole idea as well. It was a big deal because it actually came out with a real publishing company and was not self-published. I was nervous and excited for the actual pub day, as I was not sure what the reaction would be to it. On pub day, we sent out newsletters and social media posts, and everyone involved with the project posted as well. We actually got a ton of great coverage for it, and everyone seemed truly interested and excited. Even though it was on a sensitive subject matter, it was still very well received. I really felt like my heart was exploding that day  because of how supportive everyone was being. I honestly wasn't expecting such an overwhelmingly positive response. I think I am just so used to everything not going my way that seeing so many people being supportive was amazing. When I got home from work that day and got to absorb it by myself, I did actually cry. It was the first thing I did in my career that I really felt proud of and that I felt ownership over. It felt like the first major step in my career that I have been waiting for so long. I have been wanting something that could really elevate me in the publishing world, and this is definitely it for me. I was just so excited to see what was next and what would happen in the coming days.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWDXI1I1,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWDXI1I1,0.0,recalled

I believe that communication is one of the most important things in a relationship, so obviously this was not going to work. We hadn't been in a relationship for all that long. It had been about a year. That did not make it any easier though. I still think about this from time to time. Over than the issues that we had, things had been going well. I was happy.

There was many emergency trucks and even some clowns and horses too. The parade was actually long for a small town. We thought about going to the fair grounds to watch the fireworks, but it was late and we were tired. We came home and the girls played some games on the switch.

The girls gave their dad gifts and then everyone played a bomb game on the switch. It was a great family moment. The day was a sunny day and we cleaned up the yard and the house before all the family arrived. The oldest daughter arrived first and she brought fireworks and cupcakes.  She put a sparkler into one of the cupcakes after the other daughter and her husband arrived and we all went out on the porch and sang happy birthday.  Then we took the rest of the sparklers and lit off fireworks for the next hour our so. Some of them were very pretty and some of them were not that great. The whole neighborhood was full of loud booms. We were glad that the dog could no longer hear or she would have been going insane. The kids left late in the evening and just the two of us watched the fireworks over the valley. It was one of the best birthdays that I've shared with my husband.

I got dressed, rushed to get my kids ready and out the door, and then headed to the subway. Right before I got to the subway entrance I looked down and saw an envelope on the ground. It was stuffed with cash. I don't think I have ever seen so much cash in one place before. I grabbed it, and quickly scanned the envelope for a name or any identifying marks. There was nothing on it. I looked around for what I presumed would be a very frantic person, but no one seemed to be looking for anything or aware of the missing money. I called my boss letting her know I would be late, and then walked to the police office to ask what to do. They weren't exactly helpful, so I ended up keeping the cash with me and posting online to try to find the owner. So far no one has contacted me. I'm finding myself hoping to get to keep it, but also really wanting to find the owner so I no longer have to feel anxious about it. I find myself thinking of all of the things I could do with it.

My son got a job in a completely different city and state and even part of the country than we live in. I needed to help him search for apartments. I had to find something that would be safe and something that was a little cheaper. This was an emotional time for me because even though my son has been off to college and graduate school he was always in the same state as me.  We needed to help him pack up his things from his Graduate School apartment and get him off to start his new career and life. I was very sad and happy and proud at the same time. I think that part of me didn't want him to move away.  It made me think about when I was his same age and it was at that time that I moved away from my family. I remembered how my father cried and cried. He was very sad and didn't want me to go. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. So it made me think about that as I was packing up my son's things. I am grateful for today's technology that allows us to physically see each other.

I've been losing a lot of time because of it. I'm missing out on things I should be in volved in. Dinner parties, birthday parties. I'm missing out. Through therapy I'm learning how to minimize these reoccurring thoughts and try my best to live in a new way than I had before. It's affected my life basically long story short in a very painful and uneasy way. Through the pain there are moments of sunshine which I hold onto as long as I can.",3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2MNB9DY,,0.0,retold

It was a surprise diagnosis given to me after I had finally opened up about my trauma. Holding it in was hard, but getting this diagnosis was a lot harder for me. I'm decently young so I was confused as to how someone my age could get such a serious disorder. I didn't know you could have PTSD from things other than wars and such, so getting the diagnosis confused me a lot. I had to and am still in ongoing treatment for it, but at the beginning it was really tough. Going through the trauma with my therapist was exhausting and still is. Every day since then I've struggled with reality and how I view or trust the world and others. On that day I knew I had to take it slow and trust the process. Though things weren't looking too bright, I'm really glad I didn't give up. I wanted to give up more than anything but I wouldn't allow myself to. I knew there was more out there for me, so even though it hurt I pushed through. It taught me a lot though, as a positive. I've learned so many new helpful and healthy skills to deal with my emotions, as well as I've got an amazing support group.

It was sudden and unexpected as he hadn't been ill and was quite young. It has been really hard to wrap up the estate. The bank that that held his truck loan refused to do anything with us until we went to probate. We went to the probate process and become executors of the estate. The day before we got the paperwork, the bank repossessed the truck. I was so mad with how they handled it and will never do business with them as a customer. Now, we'll just have to wrap the house. My mother and I own a portion, so we just need to deal with the remaining third he owned. Our lawyer recommends waiting until the state has time to make claims against the state, but frankly, I think he is wrong about the situation. He did not receive state-sponsored health care, so they have nothing to collect on. All in all, I am still stressed and now frustrated more than anything. I do not see why the family of the deceased essentially gets punished by everyone. He didn't have much debt and hardly any assets, but we still have to worry that someone will come out of no where and make claims that we couldn't pay. We don't want to sell the house, so we'd have to get cash somehow. I hope this will be done soon. I hate dealing with it.",3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWINY1JI,,0.0,retold

She had a cropped tail and the most expressive eyes I have ever seen in an animal. She went everywhere I did and we weren't apart in the 13 years for more than a day. I think about her every day. She is buried in my garden in a spot she love to lay in while I gardened. Having a dog is big commitment and being with them at the end of their life is the hardest part.

Still, the venue we found, a vineyard out in the countryside, was stunning. The morning of the wedding I woke up at my brother's. Cheryl thought it would be bad luck to sleep in the same bed the night before the wedding. Despite the wedding not being until that afternoon, I showered and put my tuxedo on right away. My brother was my best man, so he helped keep me calm. In no time at all the wedding time rolled around, and we went to the venue. I will never forget how I felt when I saw Cheryl walking towards me in her beautiful white dress. We said our vows and quickly went to the reception area. We danced and ate late into the night.

I was thirty six weeks pregnant and not expecting to have him for three more weeks at my scheduled c-section when I unexpectedly had to go in to the hospital due to the fact that I was not feeling him move much.  I went in for monitoring and they kept me overnight.  They monitored his heart rate and it kept dropping, so in the morning they decided they would go ahead and do the surgery.  They couldn't figure out what was causing the decelerations.  I had left my house the previous night at eleven p.m. not thinking I would be staying overnight and certainly not thinking I would be having a c-section in the morning so I was totally unprepared.  All I had with me was my purse and my husband was back home with my other three children who had been asleep when I left.  I excitedly got ready for the surgery, knowing that within the hour I would have my baby in my arms but also nervous that he was going to be okay and that I would be going through surgery all alone.  Everything went smoothly though.  The anesthesiologist was really caring and sat right next to me throughout the surgery and talked to me.  When I finally heard my son's little cries, I knew everything was going to be okay.  She held him beside me while they finished stitching me up and then finally after nine months of waiting I got to hold him.  I went to recovery and held my perfect little son in my arms while I waited to go to my room.  Then, I spent two nights and three days in the hospital with my new little son.  It was hard because I had never been away from my other three kids before, but it was also special having that time just him and me together.  It had turned out that he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which is what was causing the heart decellerations.  It's a miracle that I went into the hospital that night and they decided to go ahead with the surgery.  He is now six months old and is the sweetest most precious little baby.",3EJJQNKU9SRET2L0VYPPRFZU9PJRHM,,0.0,retold

I was thirty six weeks and six days pregnant and not anticipating to have him for a few more weeks.  I have my fourth c-section scheduled already.  I was sitting at home with my husband and I noticed that I did not feel him moving as much as he normally did at night.  I got worried and called the doctor and they wanted me to go in to the hospital for monitoring.  I went in and they kept me overnight and monitored his heartrate.  His heart kept dropping which was really concerning so first thing that morning they decided to go ahead and do a c-section for his safety.  There was a lot of build up to that point where they weren't sure what they were going to do.  They kept rushing in the room every time his heart rate would drop and it was really scary to me.  I just wanted to be sure my baby was okay.  Finally they came in and announced they were going to go ahead with the surgery.  I was really nervous and excited because I had left home with just my purse and had no idea I'd be having surgery and finally meeting my little baby the next morning, but I couldn't wait to have him in my arms plus I was worried about his safety because of what was going on.  Everything happened really fast after that and within an hour or so they were pulling him out and I heard his little cries and they brought him to me so I could see his little face for the first time.  My husband wasn't there with me in the operating room so the anesthesiologist sat right beside me and held him beside me so I could see him while they finished the surgery. It turns out he had a full knot in his umbilical cord which apparently is really rare but can be very dangerous for the baby.  It was very fortunate that I had come in to be monitored and the doctor had decided to go ahead with the c-section.  I went to recovery and sat there just examining his little face and falling in love with him for the first time.  I stayed in the hospital with him for a few days and then was finally able to go home and introduce him to my other three children and my husband.  I still cherish that time in the hospital with him where it was just the two of us one on one and I finally had him in my arms.  To me he is my little miracle baby.  He's four months old now and sitting on my lap right now as I type this.  He is Such a sweet little cutie.",3EJJQNKU9SRET2L0VYPPRFZU9PJRHM,3EJJQNKU9SRET2L0VYPPRFZU9PJRHM,0.0,recalled

She was a great big dog. It was an English mastiff. She stopped being able to go down the back steps so well. It was hard to help her because she weighed 200 pounds. She wasn't that old, but those kinds of dogs don't live too long, and she was sort of fed a constant barrage of things that I didn't think dogs need to be eating. One time, though, and I wouldn't have done this if I was sober, but I fed her a bunch of this cheese bread I made, like a pizza with no sauce. It was really big, and I gave her a large amount of it. That was just once, though. Anyway, she liked to run and chase balls, play with a basketball or soccer balls because like a tennis ball, it seemed like she could swallow one of those. She started to not get up. Her legs would shake terribly, and she couldn't walk more than a few feet without having to lie down again. Eventually, she could barely stand at all. She spent a day lying on the floor, panting and trying to get up. She rolled off her doggy bed, but I couldn't get her back on it. She died later that day. My dad took it really hard as I recall, sobbing loudly and dramatically. That's no way for a grown man to carry on. Very disappointed in how he handled that. Anyway, she got buried and now there's two new puppies which are very lively and cute. I expect they'll live a long time, and probably will last my parents until the end of their lives or very close to it. I think they're very lucky not to have to deal with the deaths of any more animals, except for one more basset hound, a cat, and another cat, but that's basically it.",3EJPLAJKEN27Y4NA9WSYGRC39446ZZ,,0.0,retold

My dog died. I'd been expecting it for months. Her legs were all messed up, it was the arthritis, I think. She could barely walk at the end. By barely, I mean she couldn't get up. It was hard for her being on the linoleum floor, her feet sliding out from under her. One day she slid down and couldn't get back up. Her being two hundred pounds, I couldn't help her move too much. It was strange, because other than her legs, I wasn't aware of any other health problems. Its true that big dogs like her don't live too long, and she was seven or eight years, but I never thought about her difficulties more than mobility issues. I know that dogs can struggle and run if chased or pushed hard like on a sled, and can exacerbate themselves until they stroke out. Maybe that's what happened? Maybe she was so stressed and trying to get up that she blew her brain up. I don't know. I watched her panting and having bad time on the floor, wishing I could just move her to her bed at least. I think that was where she was trying to go. My pops didn't take it to well. I could hear him sobbing and crying most disgracefully. I can't imagine having that extreme feelings for an animal, but that's just me. I would not think it was a good idea to get another one of those kinds of dogs again, like I thought at first. They lie like a third as long as regular dogs and you can't help them move around if they get sick.

I thought that maybe the prescription had changed in my glasses and this was causing my headaches. I told the nurse at the office about my headaches and she ran all of the regular tests and checked for glaucoma. My eyes were healthy and they didn't find anything that should be causing the headaches. As soon as the doctor came in to see me, he took one look at my misaligned eyes and told me that I could have surgery to get my eyes lined up properly. He spent the rest of the time giving me information about the surgery and then asked if I was interested. I told him that I was and his office referred me to an eye surgeon the next day. I visited the eye surgeon, and she told me that because of my severe eye turn, she wouldn't be able to completely line my eyes up, but that she could get them close enough that an ordinary person could not tell that they were turned in some. She was afraid that I would see double the rest of my life if she completely aligned them. Long story short, I went ahead and scheduled the eye surgery. After hearing about all the risks involved, I had some trepidation. The surgery went very well and the thing that surprised me the most when I woke up was that I was not seeing double at all. My vision was a little cloudy and I was groggy, but, my field of vision was so much broader. I looked into the mirror and saw that my eyes were truly aligned! This was wonderful news! Recovery went well. I basically rested and didn't do much of anything while my husband took care of the house and our girls. The only side effect of the surgery was sore eyes for a few weeks, but my vision kept improving as time went by. I am so happy that I made the decision to get my eyes fixed. It has really changed my life in so many ways.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,,0.0,retold

My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,0.0,recalled

I finally decided to contact my friend who is an interior designer, to talk to me about options and budget. I told her that my top budget was $10,000 and she said that that was do-able. So, I went ahead and hired her. She was to help with design and project manage the remodel. Her contractors came over to measure etc, and I received the quote, which ended up being $10,000 PLUS the cost of all the new appliances/fixtures. i was a little frustrated as she knew my total budget was $10,000 but the new estimate would be around $14,000. I cut a few costs where possible, but we went ahead with it. I had told her the sort of countertop i wanted, but when it came time to select the countertop, the ones I wanted were double what i had initially been quoted, therefore I had to compromise and go for a cheaper countertop. My friend also gave me a presentation with several options of fixtures to chose from (sink/faucet/lighting) and i was surprised that most of the options were more than i had initally been quoted. In the end I was happy with the remodel, however disappointed in how much over budget we went. I also felt a little taken advantage of by friend. I wish she had been more upfront about the total cost, as she surely would have known given she does this for a living. Also, I had to tell some small white lies to my husband who was firm on the $10,000 budget. I am wanting to remodel the guest bathroom in my house, and this time i will hire contractors myself, and will to the design/project management without any help.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRJPFTJK,,0.0,retold

I follow her on instagram, and for many months i was daydreaming about what she could do for my kitchen. It was dated and dark, with a brown granite countertop and a horrible brown mosaic tile backsplash. It was the original kitchen from when the house was built in 1999. I gave her my ideas and told her my budget was $10,000 and she had her contractors come over and we ended up with a estimate of around $10,000 plus the cost of the appliances i wanted to buy. I needed a new cooktop, sink, faucet, pendant lighting and i wanted to put in a wine fridge. I decided to go ahead with it, and I was able to go with my friend to pick out the new counter top as well as the back splash tile, which was very exciting. There were so many options which is what i needed my friend for. Construction began just a couple of weeks ago, and we had contractors in the house for about 9 days which was somewhat disruptive to my family, as we didn't have a kitchen for that amount of time. With two small children, that was a bit difficult to deal with. Anyhow, we managed to get by and ate a lot of takeout! When it was finally done, the kitchen looked amazing and I was so happy. I ended up with a white/grey veined quartz countertop, and a grey herringbone backsplash tile. My favorite part though is the pendant lighting and the wine fridge! I wasn't quite honest with my husband though, as the total cost ended up being $14,000 including all of the appliances.

I grew up in an abusive, alcoholic household. I was constantly tormented by my mother, father, maternal grandmother, and older brother throughout my childhood. I've had such a hard time as an adult trying to navigate responsibilities and relationships. I have made many, many mistakes and missteps that were completely unnecessary, just because I had no clue how to live a functional life. I have hurt myself and others because that's all I saw the adults in my life doing as I grew up in that abusive family. I think what was most surprising to me was when I needed to move back into my parents' home for a short stint when I was in my 30's. I had hoped so strongly that this would be the opportunity for us all to be loving and supportive of each other. Instead, the abuse was just as awful as I had ever endured; except now they extended the mistreatment to my daughter, as well. The situation came to a head one night when my inebriated mother picked a fight with my daughter and me. And. my father decided to join in by striking me. I called the police. He went to jail. And I had to find another place to live immediately. I was enrolled in college at the time, trying to improve myself so I could manage raising my child on my own in a home of our own. But now, I had to try finishing college while working non-skilled jobs that didn't pay enough for us to survive. So, for the next 6 years my daughter and I were homeless, couch surfing, seedy motels, and so forth. We never knew how long we would have at any given place. We didn't have enough money for food or utilities, or medicines. I began to fall ill from the strain of such impossible circumstances. It was horrific. I am a little more settled now. But, the effects from all that atrocity has left me with, seizures, migraines, IBSD, psoriasis, arthritis, acute anxiety, clinical, depression, PTSD, insomnia and hyper somnolence, most recently starting to have frightening seizures, and worst of all PTSD. I am a tormented soul.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,,0.0,retold

It's the most frightening of all my health issues.  My health has been declining for many years. I started having terrible migraines due to child abuse suffered at the hand of my parents. That abuse actually began again from them when, as an adult, I had to move back into their home. My father tormented me endlessly while I was there instead of being supportive and helpful as I tried to rebuild my life and get back on my feet. He actually struck me one day. So, I had to leave immediately.  My PTSD became severely agitated, as well as my anxieties and depression. I struggled to hold down jobs. Homelessness was a constant threat. I developed IBSD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis and many more debilitating conditions. My life became one loss after another. I was continually abused in various dangerous roommate situations. The SS administration denied my claims for disability like it was a game to them. I continued to succumb to additional health conditions such as permanently torn muscles and connective tissues as my body slowly gave out under the pressures be demanded of it. My neck bones began to squeeze my spinal cord from a disorder called stenosis. This made me lose sensation in some body areas and gain exquisite amount of pain and function loss in m neck, shoulders, arms, elbows and hands. The pain ravages so intensely that, during an episode of intense hurting, I thought I had gone into shock. My eyes rolled back in my head, I lost my full conscious connection to my surroundings. My body trembled and shook uncontrollably, rumbled and gyrated. It felt euphoric and other-worldly. I was grateful and terrified, simultaneously. The episode caused intense emotional turmoil. Since that first time, I have seized many, many times.",3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,3EO896NRAXHN0NTINNX537GRLEBTJW,0.0,recalled

I felt an instant bond and I instantly fell in love with the little guy. He was the first newborn baby I ever got to hold and he was so squirmy! He also had a full head of hair, which was so soft and a gorgeous shade of light brown. His skin was so pink and smooth. I think he was pretty comfortable with me because he pooped while I was holding him. That got a laugh out of everyone, including the nurses. I can't wait to be there with him and watch him grow up. It was also so amazing seeing my brother and sister-in-law take on this new role. I'm sure they'll be great parents to my nephew.

Bali is absolutely amazing, there's a reason why this tropical paradise is such a travel haven, however, Indonesia is massive, with thousands of other Islands and Bali has its own culture, so in sort, Bali does Not equal the entire country of Indonesia, so this time around, I promised myself that I would step outside my comfort zone and explore other parts of this country. Yogyakarta isn't a stranger to the tourist train but its not nearly as popular as Bali and people mostly only use Yogyakarta as a pass-through state/city; they stay for a day or two, to the visit the famous temples and volcanoes and then just move on for some good old island hopping. When I arrived at his quaint not so little town I was immediately captured by the cafe's, gelato shops, cute little main streets, and beautiful street art. I walked around with the new traveler sense of wonder, even though I have been traveling for years, but everything was catching my eye, the shops, the art, the people. I allowed my eyes to scan each restaurant or local eatery, trying to make a mental list of the places I wanted to taste test dine-out experience. I tried a few different restaurants, one being my favorite; it's a healthy sort of place, you know, plenty of vegan options, glutton free, old grain, whole wheat, free-range, organic, the works; plus the food was fantastic. I ended up moving into a little homestay, which is staying inside someone's home that they still reside in. The place was absolutely adorable, cute, quite, and bohemian, just the way I like it. The house its self was in a fantastic location, I was staying in a neighborhood the was adjacent to a little village. Now when I say village I'm not talking about mud or straw huts, these were just regular, nice homes that all happened to be in a village. There was a river to walk along and a park and all these awesome local spots to eat. The best part was, it was all local, not one western restaurant, not one western cafe, nothing there had been set up for tourist, I was staying and living amongst the locals, eating beside them, getting to know them, familiarizing myself with them and that was the best part of my trip altogether. I would walk for hours down the different street seeing what I can find; it was awkward at first, it usually is, being brown-faced and bodied, with my long-dreaded braids, I get looks and curiosity all the time but I quickly smile and in return, they smile back. The locals were warm and welcoming. Indonesia is just one of those countries that just keeps on giving this is only one out of the five places I've been so far and every place to gives me good vibes, and the locals refer to Yojakarta has the cultural heart of Indonesia, so I will be definitely coming back.",3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3X62E7Y8,,0.0,retold

Yogyakarta was my state of choice and as soon as I landed I just knew I was in for a treat. Yogyakarta was absolutely astonishing, the energy and vibe here always had me on cloud 9 and smiling from ear to ear. The local people of Indonesia are amazing, friendly and welcoming. Yogyakarta is known as the cultural heart of Indonesia and I can see why. Even though Indonesia is well developed, with all the western accommodations, it doesn't feel overly developed, your surrounded by nature and still sticks to Indonesia's cultural roots. The food, the art, the temples and just the number of natural amazement's, there is a limitless amount of things you can find to do. While here I learned a bit more about the history of this country and even learned a few more words in Indonesian. I stayed amongst the locals, as well as places near trendy Main streets, with great hipster cafes, gelato shops, and high-end restaurants, however, the local street food had me coming back time and time again. I also enjoyed the time I spent with, other fellow travelers, exchanging travels stories and just getting to know one another. I hiked and camped on top on volcano mountains and swam in the most beautiful blue and turquoise oceans. I rode a motorbike through the streets, down to the countrysides and into local villages, and was always greeted with smiles and waves. I did yoga and mediated, whilst overlooking sunsets and sunrises. I loved my time in Yogyakarta Indonesia and will be visiting this beautiful country again.",3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3X62E7Y8,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3X62E7Y8,0.0,recalled

This was the first broken bone in my life. I was surprised initially when my doctor said there is no way to set a broken clavicle. He said I had to be patient and let the bone heal on it's on. The healing process took several months. In the first 6 weeks, I still experienced pain whenever I moved the wrong way. However, I was patient, and followed my doctor's instructions for healing. Finally, in early summer, I was able to get back to most of my regular physical activities. I did find that some of the muscles on the side of my body with the broken clavicle were still sore.  I finally figured this was because I had been favoring my right side when doing lifting tasks while I was healing. So I slowly started with light exercises on these muscles on the left side. Using this process, I was able to get my whole body in shape. When this skiing accident happened, I had a lot of apprehension about how my body would recover from a broken bone at my age. However, this mishap taught me that I can have a broken bone, and still recover to normal. I just had to be patient, following my doctor's instructions, and perform a good rehab program.",3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XYW27YC,,0.0,retold

This is the first time I've ever had a broken bone in my life. Aso the first time I've ever fallen so hard while skiing. I've been skiing for over 40 years, and I was on a relatively mild slope. In fact, I was near the bottom of a relatively mild slope when I noticed a large rut in the snow that I couldn't avoid. I fell forward, and landed on my left shoulder and left side of my head. Fortunately, I was wearing a helmet, and did not suffer a concussion. I was able to make it back to my car, get out of my ski equipment, and drive myself to the emergency room. Sure enough, X-rays showed a broken left clavicle. With such a break, it is not possible to put it in a cast, so I had it in a soft sling for 3 weeks. After that, I just had to let it heal naturally, which took almost 4 months. I am a pretty active person, so it was rough getting use to not being able to do all the physical sports I enjoy.  I play pickleball 3 times a week, and I had to stop while I was healing. I also had a tough time sleeping for the first month, as it hurt every time I rolled over. Even though this was my first broken bone skiing, I plan to get back on the slopes next season to enjoy the mountains in the winter, like I always have.",3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XYW27YC,3F0BG9B9MQ9QXERAWKV78Y3XYW27YC,0.0,recalled

The money I made was not much and I would have wound up paying more than I made, just to go back to work and have someone else raise my child.  We were making ends meet but we were using our credit cards for a lot of things like groceries and gas.  We didn't have a lot to show for all the debt we were accumulating.  We didn't travel or buy luxurious things, we were just living a normal life but getting deeper and deeper in debt.  We talked for a while about what we could do to help our situation and we finally decided on filing for bankruptcy.  It definitely wasn't something that we are proud of but it definitely has helped us out.  We were able to keep our house and our cars and it really helped us figure out money and bills for each month.  We have been able to set a budget for every month and really figure out our spending habits.  Do not get me wrong there are still some weeks that are tough and hard to get by depending on what bills are due at that time, but we are making it work.  I also have started working part time on MTurk to try and help out our situation and to have a little extra money each week and it has really been a helpful thing in our lives.

Worries of how you’ll perform as a parent are overwhelmed as you look into their eyes and you know it’s going to be OK. Kids call you to a higher level of living.  I cried when my daughter was born.  These weren’t quiet, demure tears. They were big, breathless sobs. The very air sucked out of me as I held my baby, her own squalling cries drowning out my own. I was overwhelmed. I had never felt so much before. Conventional parenting wisdom says the day your child is born is one of the happiest of your life.  At the time I didn’t feel happy. I barely knew what I felt at all.  I was filled with an indescribable emotion—some mix of everything all at once. I was awed. I was humbled. I was proud.  I loved myself then more than I ever had before. I couldn’t be all bad if I had created something so small and precious. I held her and let myself be swept away by the feeling. I laughed—and even laughed as I cried.  I didn’t know I could love so much. I didn’t know anything in the world could be so important to me and so worth protecting. But, when she was born, something in me changed.",3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN21GHPFE,,0.0,retold

It can be described as a big drop of water that falls on your umbrella and you feel the vibration of it in the handle. Then my water broke. It was nothing like I imagined. And so the task of a long labor began. Twelve hours plus later, when my strength was running thin the medical team arrived to help deliver the baby. I was eagerly anticipating seeing her and holding her in my arms for the first time. You hear the cry and you look at the red baby that the doctor holds in his hands, and then the nurse takes the baby and brings it on your chest. That moment when the baby first lays on your chest is magic. You go from hearing a crying baby to quiet time. And I say quiet because, besides the fact that baby stopped crying, I honestly did not hear anything else that happened around me afterwards. Looking at the baby girl was all I was able to do. Awed, amazed, and thankful for such a blessing! Brown fine hair covered her little head, she had her eyes open and her head turned towards me, her skin was pink and wrinkled, and looked soft, she had all ten fingers and toes and that felt ridiculously reassuring, even though I already knew that the newborn was physically healthy. The nurse dried her and wrapped her loosely in a newborn blanket. I was then able to hold her for the first time. She had her little fingers in her mouth and was quietly looking up at my face, somewhat expectant. I looked in the dark blue eyes of my little angel and tears of joy filled my eyes. It felt euphoric and unreal to hold my own baby in my arms. She was light and fragile, she felt warm, and she looked so content. I touched her little wrinkled fingers and she clasped my finger in a tight grasp! All I could focus on was her.",3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN21GHPFE,3FIJLY1B6VQ93TEFNGX0JZN21GHPFE,0.0,recalled

I thought they might have trouble finding her a home because she was a black cat. The next morning I decided to keep the cat. I went out and bought everything she needed to make her happy.

My close and immediate family is relatively small compared to most people.  I only have  two pairs of aunts and uncles with 6 total cousins (although 3 of them are married), and 5 little nieces/nephews who are all under 8 years old that I see on a regular basis, even on holidays.  My father's side of the family is not in our lives, so gatherings are usually small and more personal and intimate.  So in other words, it's a tight knit family and my great Aunt is basically the ""matriarch"" of the family. The event was a simple party where we rented out a room for everyone in a nice Italian restaurant.  Almost everyone was there with the exception of my brother who was working and my cousin and his wife and kids who are currently living in DC.  There was also a few close family friends like my late Uncle's boyfriend as well to celebrate with us. What made the event/party so special and memorable is not just that my Aunt is now 100, it's how in relatively good health she still is in!  Aside from not being able to drive anymore, she is still able to live on her own and take care of herself without needing any sort of assisted living.  She is still as sharp as ever mentally and is probably the most wholesome and nicest person that I have ever met!  One of the things that she did was dig up some really old photos of everyone from when they were kids and passed them around after dinner.  Even though I looked goofy younger, it was still a really touching moment because she had photos of everyone there from when they were kids.  She really has been through and seen a lot and it's incredible that she is still going strong.  I'm not usually a big fan of family gatherings since I do not have very much in common with most of my family, but this event was one I was really happy to be a part of.",,3FTF2T8WLS4QMSK3WGB31X9NT3FW9S,0.0,recalled

My daughter was very nervous and I had trouble convincing her to take her foot off of the brake.  After a while, she calmed down somewhat and she was off. Initially, she was having trouble accelerating and braking smoothly. I soon realized that it was her shoes! She had worn flip flops to her first driving lesson. We then pulled over and she found a pair of tennis shoes in the trunk. After that, it was much smoother driving. We worked on turns and braking. We even did some parking lessons. I also went over the dashboard features and would quiz her on the names of certain things. She did a great job and we worked on a lot of things.

They were given their assignments and test dates and they just had to finish by the time the rest of the class graduated.  Seeing how he didn't seem to care all that much, we had pretty much resigned ourselves to the fact that he would end up having to get his GED because it wasn't looking all that good.  To my surprise, my brother called me a day or two before and said that he had not only finished his studies but that the Principal had decided to let him walk with his class afterall.  I don't have kids of my own so he and his sister are my whole world.  My niece was a straight A honor student who was in drama and on the dance team at school.  She was in advanced classes from the time that she was 6 and it always came easy for her.  She received a scholarship to a 4A well known college.  I think that my nephew always felt like he had to live up to that and that just wasn't the case.  She was a freak of nature and nobody could be like her.   So as we sat in the crowded gym that Sunday, I saw him walk out and he looked up at us in the bleachers and the smile on his face melted my heart.  He looked so proud in that moment and I knew that he would be okay.  Hearing his name finally called and watching him walk across the stage to get that diploma was one of the highlights in my life.",3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWECYZ3H9,,0.0,retold

He had been at his former job for 10 years but they moved the plant out of state and he chose not to move.  He was given an impressive severance package and life was good for awhile collecting unemployment and salary. He made the mistake if waiting too long to start looking not ever thinking for a second he would have a hard time finding employment due to his experience and work history.  It was a lot harder than he thought due to his age.  Finally, when we had exhausted every last dime possible, a job came through. We were able to catch u[ on utility bills and we were about to start paying on outstanding debt when the unimaginable happened again.  He got laid off again!  This time around he was able to find another job but this one is so far away it is taking a toll on him mentally and physically.  I worry about him. Right now, he has been praying for some sort of relief when again, out of the blue, recruiters started calling him again.  he had three interviews last week and we are hoping for some call backs this week but doesn't look too good, it is already Tuesday and we have not heard anything yet.  All I can do is try and make his life easier and be a strong pillar for him.

I say joyous because we did not think that he was going to get  to walk across stage due to some trouble that he had gotten into earlier in the year that landed him out of physical school and having to finish his senior year online.  I love this kid more than I can express.  He reminds me so much of myself when I was his age and my only hope is that he pulls through this and gets his life together.  His sister was always brilliant.  She was always in advanced classes and graduated 6th in her class all while performing in drama club and dancing on the high school dance team.  She graduated high school and went on to pursue her college degree at Purdue, largely on scholarships.  She starts her senior year this year and has had somehow found the perfect balance of partying and studying.  She has maintained an ""A"" average and can party harder than I ever could.  Very proud of her.  I think somehow my nephew feels that he could never measure up to his older sister but nobody expected him to.  She is a freak of nature and we only wanted him to do what he was capable of.  So when my brother called to tell me that he had been kicked out of school and could not graduate with his class, my heart broke.  I went through that spell when I was in high school as did my brother but we both pulled it together in the end.  I had given up hope in seeing him graduate but at the very last minute, they called and told him that since he had finished all of his online studies, he could walk across the stage with his class.  I immediately started crying when he walked out, ever so casually.  He looked up into the stands and gave me a wave and that beautiful smile of his.  My heart beamed with pride as I sat and waited for his name to be called.  3 months later and he has not really changed.  I am still hopeful that he will come to his senses and find his way in life.  I had a son when I was 18 years old and had given him up for adoption.  My nephew was born 6 years later and I think this is the main reason that I have always felt so close to him.  And the main reason why my heart breaks when he does stupid stuff that he knows he should not do.  Still, I have hope that like the rest of us, he will wake up and realize that he can do better and will go on to lead a successful and productive life.",3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWECYZ3H9,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWECYZ3H9,0.0,recalled

This is something that I have been dreaming about for years. It was something that I worked on for years by taking tests, writing papers, and attending classes. There were countless nights studying and worrying. Student teaching was long and expensive since I had to pay to not work. It was also exhausting working full-time and then taking classes at night. To finally be done with my credential and master's was a huge accomplishment for me. Walking down the stage at graduation felt amazing. I realized that this was likely the last time that I would attend a graduation as a student. That is, unless I decide to go back for my doctorate degree. However, whether I decide to go back for another graduate-level degree or not, the accomplishment of getting my master's degree can never be taken away from me. My parents and grandparents were extremely proud. My long-term boyfriend was extremely proud. I realized that the next time I attend a graduation will likely be for my students, since I am trying to teach high school level students.

All events were inside so we quickly ran in and did not let the rain bother us. I got to pick out any red dress I wanted to. I liked that we did not have to wear a specific bridesmaid dress. My sister got dressed and she looked so classic. Her dress was simple and really flattered her. When all was ready we walked down the aisle and had a fast ceremony. The place looked beautiful. It was still decorated for Christmas and just looked like a winter wonderland. The ceremony was quick and straight to the point but there were some really powerful moments. Once the ceremony was over the family took some pictures and then enjoyed cocktail hour. The food was fantastic and then once that was over we danced the night away.

It was so beautiful. It was right after the holidays and the place was decorated in almost a Christmas like theme but more winter. My sister looked stunning. She wore a long sleeve dress that was plain and simple but the arms and the back were shear that gave it a little something extra. I stayed with her while we got ready and got our hair and makeup done. I went for a simple up do and natural makeup. My sister kept her hair down with a clip and went for natural make up as well. We were allowed to pick out our own bridesmaid dresses as long as they were a shade of red. Her bridal party was just me and our other sister. We arrived to the wedding that evening and it was pouring. It was okay though because the wedding was inside and we did not need to worry about the weather. We finished getting ready and the guests started to fill in. I walked down the aisle and it was beautiful. It was all pine and lights, they did a great job. Then my sister walked down the aisle and she really took my breath away. She looked so beautiful and so happy. I almost cried but just got teary eyed. The wedding ceremony was beautiful  and quick. It was right to the point and I liked that. Once the ceremony was over we went to cocktail hour and they had delicious hor'dourves. The real fun was when the party began. They had great music and we danced the night away.

We went over to visit her often during treatments, went to the hospital when she was checked in for the initial treatments, and generally kept up a lot of support. Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her. She seemed to be handling treatment well. Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate. We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc. So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water. It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away. As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary). It was hard to post her final goodbye to friends on FB after she passed, but I did what she asked. Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources. Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support. I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney. Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well. He still needs help accessing all of the resources she left him and after his power was shut off reached out for help. The surprises just don't end with this event, they just keep coming and coming and I pray they will settle down soon.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LZ2FW52,,0.0,retold

She had asked me to be the executor of her trust so we spent a lot of time together going over important details and how to handle things after her death. We expected her to live a lot longer, but she died suddenly and not from the cancer. She was in the middle of her treatments, going for radiation and chemo, her hair was starting to fall out and she shaved her head. My son and I would visit her every couple of weeks just to check in and keep tabs on her, and see if she needed anything. She lived with her grandson, who is 23. He was struggling with this as both of his parents were really horrible and his grandmother was really the only stable person he had in his life. One day I get a call that Auntie had a stroke. She went into surgery, but it didn't appear she would really recover from this. We went to visit her a few times in the hospital. My mother was there every day as she the medical decision making power. She was not going to come back and be herself. She was breathing on her own however she didn't respond to us really. She would look around and turn toward a voice, but otherwise she didn't really respond. She had a dnr and she had told us she didn't want extraordinary measures taken. So the decision was made to let her go. It was sad that she died this way, and so soon. We surely didn't expect it this quickly, and certainly not from a stroke. I then had to take over as executor of her trust which wasn't an easy task, and I had to inform people of her death and post on Facebook for her.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LZ2FW52,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LZ2FW52,0.0,recalled

I remember a few construction majors I took classes with sitting ahead of me, wearing hard hats. They were asked to remove them, unfortunately. Graduation started from the front, with the school of medicine. There was a famous speaker, a comedian, and he was clearly drunk. I saw a few people I knew from high school, and started feeling a bit nervous. As our turn was approaching, we tried to calm down and prepare. Once it was my turn, I felt fine.

Well, 5 months ago, I had a baby boy! I distinctly remember the anticipation of his birth, it was a testy time for me for sure. My wife was under a lot of physical and mental stress, and I was eagerly waiting for labor day, but I was fearful yet excited. It's a feeling I'm not sure if I will feel again, especially when my wife went into labor. I didn't know what was going on -- it felt like adrenaline running through my veins and I felt frantic but also that I knew exactly what I was doing and what needed to be done. I was there to support my wife at all steps and I wished most in the world for the healthy birth of my son and that my wife would be alright. When he was finally born, I remember making a look of shock and awe to my wife, especially when she handed him to me to hold. It was crazy to think that my own son was in my hands, and only a few months back I never had any time of feelings like this. I was almost overwhelmed, but my wife and I always wanted a family, and this had been years in the making. Honestly, some of my first thoughts were, ""Can I do this? Am I going to be a capable father?"". My wife helped me put those thoughts to rest quick, and the joy of having my son around drowned out those types of thoughts quickly when my family and my wife's family showed up to support us, as well as our friends. The amount of support was really incredible. I don't think we had to buy a thing for 3 months as people came in in droves to support us it seemed. I'm a family man now,  and I love it.",,3GNCZX450J9E72X7C0B85YCB5OYAPT,0.0,imagined

It was an arduous journey to get there and I was short on funds so I decided not to walk. It also seemed silly to celebrate an organization that demonstrated time and time again that it didn't care about me or my peers. Let's be honest with ourselves, university functions are rarely about the students themselves and their accomplishments. That said, I somewhat regret not walking because a few of my peers did. We were a class of 9 and about half of us chose to attend the graduation ceremony. My peers were what made graduate school worthwhile. They helped me learn and supported me like no other. While, yes, I had a few professors who taught me a great deal about my particular concentration, the overall impression that I was left with by the faculty was that I was labelled as a lost cause (and too fat to be taken seriously... but that's a different story). For as much as my family insisted that this was an accomplishment, it didn't feel that way. It felt more like a significant waste of my time, energy, and capital. It has been hard to fully process all of my feelings about graduating. I wish I felt proud, but I was unpleasantly surprised to find that I  mostly felt lost, worthless, and full of resentment. That may have been the primary motivator for not wanting to participate outside of not being able to spare the expense. I hope I can one day reflect more positively on my graduation, but right now I'm struggling with this less than stellar emotional quagmire.",,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVA6C8GW2,0.0,recalled

My husband and I planned a surprise 60th birthday party for my mother-in-law at a restaurant that we all go to often. I invited her sister and nieces who live out of town. My husband and I went to the restaurant about a half hour before she would be arriving and decorated the room with balloons and streamers. The restaurant had a small private room for parties.  My mother-in-law didn't know what was going on until she walked into that room.  She thought she was meeting us for her birthday dinner but did not expect to see her sisters and nieces and some friends there too. When she walked in the room she was completely surprised and very happy. She was not expecting everyone to be there. She hadn't seen her sister in quite a while and she was so excited that she was there. Everything turned out great. The food and service at the restaurant was amazing. We had reserved the room for 3 hours. The party continued after we left the restaurant. We ended up going back to my brother-in-law's house and spent the rest of the night playing games. It truly was a great day.,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN4FGWA,,0.0,retold

I have never planned a surprise birthday before so I was very exciting about it. I knew my mother-in-law would not be expecting a surprise party so that made it even better. I called some of her close relatives who lived out of town to plan to be down for her birthday weekend. I reserved a private room at a restaurant that we frequent often so she would think we were just going out to dinner for her birthday. I went to the restaurant about a half hour before I knew my mother-in-law would be there and I decorated the tables with frames with picture of her over the years and I had a special cake made for her. It ended up being an amazing night because when my in-laws arrived at the restaurant my mother-in-law was so surprised to see her sister and her nieces there and was thrilled that we surprised her. It was so much fun. She appreciated it so much to have all her family there. The whole weekend ended up being fantastic. My mother-in-law usually is the one who plans everything. She is not used to having someone do all the planning and her not knowing anything about it. My husband and I bought her this amazing digital frame that anyone she invites can send pictures to it. It was a gift she never expected. I managed to find a lot of old family photos of hers and had them uploaded on the frame so she would be excited to see them.,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN4FGWA,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN4FGWA,0.0,recalled

It has been a whirlwind year with many changes, however today was by far the biggest change.  I woke up this morning in in the queen size bed of the hotel room my fiance and I stayed in while in Gatlinburg, Tennessee.  Excitement, nervousness, and joy were racing through my veins as I crawled out of bed and looked at my fiance sleeping in the queen sized bed beside mine.  I quickly got up and ready for the historic day.  I located my phone to check the weather hoping that it had magically changed from the previous day.  As I looked down at what my phone said, I let out a soft curse word out of frustration.  It was still calling for a 60% chance of rain.  My fiance woke up asking what was wrong.  I told her, and she said it was okay.  We had made alternate plans just in case this were to happen.  My fiance got out of bed and kissed me.  She proceeded to calmly get ready for the day as I continued pacing nervously.  It stopped raining about 30 minutes before it was time for us to leave.  I looked at my fiance with hopeful eyes praying that the rain would hold for a couple of hours.  We hopped into my car and began driving towards our destination.  As we got closer to our destination I could begin to see a patch of blue sky begin to form from the surrounding gray spots.  We finally arrived at the waterfall, and the preacher was there waiting for us.  My fiance's eyes lit up at the site.  She had always wanted to be married by a waterfall.  It was a short ceremony but one that would forever change our lives.  Today was the day that I married the love of my life.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,0.0,recalled

It was in April. I had so many family and friends around and it was a really joyous occasion for me. I mean, I am getting hooked to my best friend!!!. We were really excited and looked forward to the beautiful life we will be spending together. The wedding reception took place at a lovely place and had a royal theme. It was filled to the brim and my friend told the audience about our beautiful love story. We started out as just neighbors when we were much younger. We met in the university and fell hopelessly in love with one another. We got so many gifts and my father-in-law gave us a car. My mother gave us dishwashers and a washing machine. Matter of fact, most of our home appliances were gifts. My wife initially wanted a smaller occasion. However, with the massive turn out and the opportunity for so many people to see each other again, she was grateful it was an elaborate one. Quite a number of my friends thanked me for the opportunity given. We hope to have a baby soon and hopefully, we will get to see ourselves again.",3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMPS9LP8,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMPS9LP8,0.0,recalled

As nights out are not something that can be done daily. As fun as that could be but overall it is a highlight for me. Like so many things can be mundane. And not be what you really want them to be when you go out. its good that something at least is what it should be nothing more nothing less. Which since the time of the event i have done it a couple more times. And i plan to go again somewhere else again as drinking and kicking the bucket with friends with a band playing awesome music. Is some of the best moments i have had though that night was in paticular better. Because the bands that played killed it so hard. They were heavy hard and just ripped through their sets. Plus their were so many of them which was a good turn around.,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,,0.0,retold

The act of getting ready which can take some time. which some people seem to find fun? I do not because it is just something i wish could be just over with. But alas it is needed to get towards the main event and just go with it. But well it could be much worse than it already is. So i go out and it is just a long night which is good as this is supposed to be a good night which by all accounts it was. And i will say it is but i did have a bit to drink and the show was just a heck of  a time.

The evening was her birthday and I got home just as the delivery man was leaving with the ring.  It was too expensive to leave on the porch so he had to leave a note and I missed him the day before.  But not today I was able to get the ring.  I needed it that night to ask her to marry me as well.  So with the ring nervously in my pocket we went to dinner and I dont think she even knew.  It finally came time to ask her and people were seemingly ready to leave.  So I had to do it.  I had to finally ask her or I'd have to find another time and be super nervous all over again.  She said yes!  We were pretty happy to share the moment with my family, her family and our son.  The resturant printed off the menu for us and it said congrats to us. We are now very happy together and have been able to share things equally.  We live together and share expenses and those things are working out great.

First, it was on the Fourth of July weekend, which is my son's favorite holiday and it meant I had to spend time away from my family because it was not an all ages party. Second, this weekend already takes a lot out of me because I hate the heat and the street fair, so I was already tired from trying to make up time missed with my son. I couldn't even take my wife because someone needed to be with my kid, so I was essentially going alone when compared to this vast network of friends that were totally hip and cool that my brother has met over the years. Regardless, I did decide to attend and I road into town with my aunt. We had a great conversation, actually, and it was very pleasant. I did also meet a couple that were friends of my brother and they felt similarly outcast.  The location was a rooftop bar and it was nice enough, but way too nice for someone like me who is not used to this luxury. The niceness of the bar alone was enough for me to feel as if I were a total outcast. This is my brother's lifestyle right now, though, so it made good sense to him and his fiancee. After the party was over, we had a smaller group dinner which gave me a lot more comfort. It was only about ten people and I enjoyed meeting his to-be father-in-law. This guy seemed wild, but also quite nice. I liked him a lot. When the family was made smaller in this setting, it was much better. Putting all this aside, though, I am glad I went - not for me, but for him. It was good to support his first steps into this new life.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H2Z9O5,,0.0,retold

I was very happy for him and I felt like this was a big step for him. He was once an angry young man. He had a lot of things that he was concerned about in life, and I think that finding someone to love was something that he had a feeling would elude him for a long time. I am very happy for him, though, that he was able to find someone. When he told me they were engaged, I was excited. Then he told me there would be an engagement party and that I was invited to the party. I am not a party person. In fact I am not really interested in parties at all. When I found this would be a large gathering at a roof top bar, I have to admit that I was not excited for this part of the engagement in the least. I arrived looking at least like I cared - and indeed, I did care a lot for there engagement. I wouldn't have gone unless I cared a lot. I hope that he does know that even showing up is something I wouldn't do for just anyone. It was so hot and muggy and I didn't know anyone there except my parents. I felt rather lonely and overwhelmed. I don't even drink, so it was tough for me to find anything worth doing. I did end up chatting with his to be father-in-law and that was a very pleasant conversation. Out of all this, I did feel as if I got closer to everyone involved and I really appreciated the opportunity to go. I just don't like social events, usually. It was a rather rewarding moment of growth for me.",3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H2Z9O5,3HHRAGRYX9RIHJB15UKTK3W1H2Z9O5,0.0,recalled

We understood that my uncle had a chest infection that developed into sepsis. His son rushed him to the hospital. My uncles wasn't insured. The hospital refused to offer him treatment until the fees are paid in advance. My cousin tried to gather enough cash to pay the hospital.

He had a heart condition due to his past drug abuse, and since he had an extremely low chance of survival, no doctor wanted to perform the surgery on him. I contacted him and though there was little I could do, I recommended him some good hospitals with heart surgeons who had worked miracles on my grandparents. I also sent him some healing oil blessed by Padre Pio, which he said he never got. Not long after the surgery, I spoke with him to ask how the surgery went. He said it went well but that he still didn't think he was going to make it. He died a few months later. I felt shocked when I heard the news. I also felt very sad. It was a bit of a ""thing"" to think about, that the last time I spoke to him, he told me he felt he wasn't going to make it. And he didn't make it. He was right. I also feel like I should have done something to help him. or at least give him comfort. But in reality, what could I do? I couldn't cure his ailment.  I felt relieved, and convinced myself that he was going to be fine because he had lived through the operation. This was selfish of me. I wanted the relief of not having to worry about it anymore.

He was taken out of school and put in a group home due to abuse of his parents. I really was crazy about him, but he wasn't that crazy about me. He ended up breaking up with me, but we stayed friends. We lost contact for many years but then got in touch again via social media when he added me on Facebook. We were both married to other people and of course neither of us were interested anyway. Still, I was happy he remembered me and felt quite touched that he wanted to reconnect. Ok that's the back story. Here's the hard part. In February of this year,he suddenly posted on Facebook that he hard a heart condition and he only had a few months, or even weeks left to live, as no doctor would agree to do the necessary surgery. His heart was in really bad condition, he said, due to his previous drug addiction. I was stunned, and I messaged him about it. He said he was searching for a new surgeon who would agree to take on the risk. I even sent him a packet of Padre Pio's healing oil that I had, but a month or so later, he asked me if I had ever sent it, meaning he never got it. I'm not sure what happened. I thought maybe his wife took the package since it was from a woman, but that's just my guess as it is something I would have done. I found myself feeling really sad and thinking about him a lot, and contacted him often to see how he was doing. By March, he had found a doctor willing to do the surgery. After the surgery he wasn't online for awhile so I kept checking his page for any sign of that he was ok. Finally I messaged him, an he said the surgery went well but he was still afraid he was going to die. As for me, I knew he'd be fine. A few months passed, and I didn't hear from him. Just yesterday I went on his facebook page to message him and see how he was doing, and I saw that the page has been turned into a remembrance page. He died just months after the last time we talked.

I think I was about 4 years old. I remember thinking he was the coolest guy alive. I remember the first time he hit me for no reason i was 10. He was mad at something I cant remember what but he picked me up and threw me into the tv. I really remember feeling pain i just remember my head feeling numb almost like white noise. I cried thinking it had to be my fault I was gonna be better. But I never did get better and things got worse. My father was addicted to drugs I knew that I think it was something everybody knew. I had tried over the years to get him clean. Nothing worked i began to hate him blaming him for everything that happened bad in my life.  I looked at his body in the casket i kissed his cheek he was cold. Almost as cold as our relationship had been while i was growing up.

I was embarrassed by his drug use I was embarrassed by  how he looked so i lied. That could of been a moment but i denied it because of my bitterness.

We went out and ate dinner, things seemed to be going well. I wasnt to concerned since the contractions weren't severe.

On the way to the hospital we hit rush hour traffic and my water broke. My husband proceeded to call 911 in case we didnt make it there in time.  It seemed likeforever but we made it to labor and delivery. I was put in a wheelchair and taken right up to the delivery room. I was already dilated 7 cm. My husband called everyone but within 20 minutes our son had arrived. He was a little jaundiced but fine. He was 6pound 10 oz. He had black hair and brown eyes, he looked just like his older brother.  He cried a lot right after being born but that night he fed and slept well. We had family visit us from out of state, we face times and facebooked everyone else. His older brother wasnt to happy about the new addition but after we got home he really started warming up to him. He slept the first night at home so peacefully, he didnt wake until about 7 am for feeding. My husband stayed home for the first 2 weeks and my mother in law stayed for 2 weeks after that. He was very quiet and calm, he smiled a lot since the day he was born. He was not a difficult baby at all.  He grew really well, in fact was in the 95th percentile. He looks so much bigger even now, people think he is much older. Him and his older brother get along much better now, they are the best of friends.",3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9XDY8T,,0.0,retold

I still can't believe that this is actually my house.  Waking up in my house makes all of the stress from the past couple of months worth it.  All those homes that I toured and put a bid on only to find out that I was too late seem to have led to the perfect house - the house that was meant for me.  Then again, I cannot help bu wonder ""How can I have a house when part of me still feels like I am not really a grown up - not like my parents were when I was growing up""? Lol!  I know that I have a good job, worked hard to save for the down payment and went through all of the necessary paperwork but I still kind of feel like I am just playing ""adult"" and doing ""adult"" things.  I wonder if other people feel like this.  I am not really too worried about making the monthly payments which are about 1/3rd of my monthly take home pay.  Still, the thought of owing over $200K to anyone is a bit daunting.  Still, I can't help but spending all of my time thinking about how I want to decorate this place.  I find myself looking online at different websites for decorating ideas constantly.  I have book-marked so many things on Pintrest that I will have a hard time even remembering what it was about the site that made me want to book mark it.  I think that I will start in the living room.  I want to be able to come home at night and immediately feel like I am at ""my"" home. I think that this weekend I will go to Home Depot and pick up some paint.  I can't believe that I am actually excited about painting!  Two years ago, I would have seen a three day weekend as a time to party - now I am looking forward to painting baseboards and walls.  Maybe I am more of an adult than I thought?",,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZSJ3V8Y7,0.0,imagined

I introduced him to his instructor, walked away, and he just started crying! I had to physically leave the area because anytime he made eye contact, he would start to silently sob. It was heartbreaking, but I knew it was for the best. He needed to learn that he was safe with other teachers/lifeguard, as long as he followed their instructions and listened. This went on, more or less, for the entire session. I signed him up for session two, and he did so great! I walked him over to the instructor, gave me a kiss, and went with her. I sat across the pool from him, where he could see me, and instead of crying he would wave. He became more comfortable on his back and on his tummy, and is pretty much an expert (for a 2-year-old) at holding his breath. When swim lessons were done he would tell me that Sydney (his teacher) was very nice. When we would get in the car to come back the next day, he would say the same. Instead of being scared of the water, he was becoming a ""big boy"" and going in safely on his own.

These were the first lessons by himself, where he did not have me in the pool. The first 2 days were awful; he cried and cried, so I literally left the pool area. It was somewhat painful for me emotionally, but I knew in the long run it was going to be worth it. By the 3rd day he still seemed a bit sad, but he wasn't crying all class like before. And then, by the time we were done with session one lessons, he was happy as could be. I signed him up for another session, and now he looks forward to it daily. He tells me that his teacher is very nice, and that he likes swimming. After class, we go to the outside pool and practice what he learned. For only being 2 years old, I think he is doing great! He can float on his back and dunk his head. He is fearless coming down the slide, and always asks for more! I think by the end of this session he will be ready for the next level up. He is starting to search for things under water, and know that he can hold his breath.

Sometimes I dislike other people's kids, but that's mostly because other people don't look after their kids. Well in this specific time, I'm looking after several kids with several parents. Every summer I try to organize group trips with other parents in the neighborhood. This year we went out to a nearby park several miles from the house. This isn't a kids park though, many of the directives suggest we be armed in case of a wild animal attack. Luckily I was. Around night time after cooling off one of the soup pots they provide to us on our trip, we prepare for bed using several sleeping bags and a tent. Suddenly, I hear gunshots. In our current climate, you always have to be wary of gunshots as it could be indiscriminate massacre or self defense of a wild bear attack. I shove my kids into our fan and load up my rifle and a shotgun. I figure if it's a bear I can barricade myself inside and hose him down with both guns. I hear more gunshots in the distance, I hear other parents scrambling with their kids to safety in other camps. After about 20 minutes, we see flashlights i the distance, rangers coming by to let us know that a bear had indeed made his way into the reserve but had been taken down before anyone could get hurt. Personally, I figure the only one getting hurt had the bear made it to us would have been Mr. Bear. It didn't come to that, however.",3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVBAWJCYP,,0.0,retold

I'm not really much of a ""Camping"" kind of person but this was more about male bonding than anything else, or at least I thought it'd be. So we pull up to the camp site not far from where we live. It's one of those places with campsites already built into the area for school trips and whatnot. We set up our tents and our cookware a few miles down in the wildlife area. The first thing they want to do is make smores, of course. By the time we're done it's about 7 PM and because it's so late in August the sun is already on it's way out. We start a fire for light, I teach my sons how to carve wood with their scout knives. We all thought it was a relatively safe area but then I started hearing loud pops in the distance. At first I thought it was fireworks, then I realized they were gunshots from a rifle. The area isn't meant for hunting and the only animals that would be worth hunting for here would be bears. I assume that this is the case, but my kids are scared at this point. They've seen the news regarding mass shooting and they're not as familiar with guns as I am. The shooting gets closer and the threat of both gunmen and wild animals means I have to call the rangers and alert them of the situation. I go into my jeep and grab my rifle and tell both my sons to hunker in the vehicle until they come. Luckily, it gets uneventful afterwards. The rangers come by to acknowledge our presence and tell us that there were indeed people shooting at a bear about a mile or so away. It's not as scary looking back but I was definitely frightened for my kids.",3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVBAWJCYP,3HPZF4IVNNFW9VM6N13IOKVBAWJCYP,0.0,recalled

We both love being in nature, and a chance to see some snow in the middle of summer sounded amazing. I took a bus from Los Angeles to meet him in Oakland, and then we drove the rest of the way to Lassen. We were lucky enough to find a nice campsite in Manzanita Lake Campground. We spent the first day wandering around the lake, kayaking, admiring the views, and just lounging beneath the pine trees in our tents. The next day, we drove to Burney Falls, which was beautiful, and then passed by a lava cave, and then onwards to Butte Lake. We hiked up the Cinder Cone Trail, trudging up the short but steep and slippery slope of cinders, leading to the crater and to more gorgeous views of mountains, lakes, and volcanic beauty. After a long day, we headed back to the campground and stopped beside the lake to watch the sunset and the alpenglow reflected on the water. The next morning, we woke up early to hike up Mt. Lassen, which was still covered in snow, driving past tall snowbanks and snow-covered landscapes. I was worried about the snow and how well our microspikes would perform, but it turned out fine! We arrived at the trailhead around 7 am, with only a few cars in the lot, and slowly but surely made our way up the summit, following the muddy tracks left across the snow by other hikers. We enjoyed watching some skiers quickly zip down the slopes from the summit, wondering at their speed and balance and fearlessness. My brother was hit by a bout of altitude sickness, so we arrived at the summit around 11, taking our time to catch our breath and admire the views. After some rest and lots of pictures, we headed back down, the snow becoming slushier with the increasing heat and traffic. It was an invigorating hike, and I found myself happy to not let my fears and doubts prevent me from experiencing it. We drove some more to the Visitor's center, awestruck by the wide views of forests, wildflowers, and the streams of water from the melting snow. It was a long, but peaceful drive to camp, where we both just ended up relaxing.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DB4NSE2,,0.0,retold

It wasn't actually my birthday yet, but I love hiking and my brother lives in another part of the state and couldn't go on my actual birthday so we decided to go on our annual hiking trip and chose Lassen for our destination. A friend of a friend had recently visited and showed pictures of the snow-covered mountain, and we both thought it would be fun to go to somewhere with snow in the middle of summer. I took a bus to Oakland and then we drove from there to Lassen, arriving at the park and snagging a camping spot at 3 AM but sleeping in the car. We woke up around 6 AM with the sun filtering between the pines, and set up our tents and  made breakfast. We went to the ranger station to ask for advice and recommendations. We then went around the Manzanita Lake, and saw gorgeous views of snow-covered Lassen Peak reflected across the placid lake with ducks and ducklings bobbing in and out of the water. We rented a kayak and paddled around the lake, admiring the views and relaxing under the sun and cool, light breeze. We were still pretty tired from the long trip, so we just relaxed in our campsite for the rest of the day, cooking and reading and chatting. The next day we headed up to Butte Lake to hike the Cinder Cone Volcano. It looked like a short and easy hike until we started going up the volcano since the steep trail consisted of loose cinders that made you slip back some inches with every step forward. It was the first time I'd ever gone up to a volcano's crater, and the views were fantastic. Going down was more of psychological challenge since I felt like I would slide down to my death and went down very slowly. We relaxed by the Butte Lake and dipped our dirty, dusty feet on the freezing water until heading over to Redding to buy some microspikes since we wanted to climb up Lassen Peak. Redding was hot and uneventful, but we got our microspikes. We had to wake up early the next day to climb the Lassen Peak, and although we were expecting snow, we didn't realize how much snow there actually still was. As SoCal residents we usually just see snow in the distant San Gabriel mountains, and driving up close to 15 feet high snowbanks was a surreal and awesome experience. We'd never hiked in snow and were really excited to try out the microspikes, but I was also hesitant since I'm prone to altitude sickness and was hoping it wouldn't ruin our trip. Luckily I didn't and we powered our way up the snowy trail, removing the spikes once the snow had melted away near the top. The views, as ever, were gorgeous and we looked down on a snow-dappled landscape and an icy lake. We reached the summit and took many photos, watching some people ski down the side of the mountain. It was an awesome trip and one of my most memorable ones.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DB4NSE2,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DB4NSE2,0.0,recalled

Our drive to college was enjoyable. We sang and talked and sang some more. we had a good time. when we finally got to his college apartment our moods changed a little due to the chaos of everyone moving in. we quickly unloaded the U Haul and moved it out of the way. Now it was time to organize and put things away in his apartment. This, also, was a fun time. I could tell my son was excited to live on his own. I had packed a lunch so we took a break to eat, laughed and planned his apartment. we decided the best layout for his room and his furniture. I think we took longer than necessary to avoid goodbyes. once there was nothing left to do, sadness set in. It was time to go. Saying goodbye was very hard. I did not want to leave and my son did not want us to either. he kept talking to us with a glimmer of tears in his eyes and I could tell he did not want us to leave but it was getting late and it was time.  It is very hard for a mom to leave her son behind to be on his own. I hugged him, told him that I loved him and how proud i was of him. I go into the truck and waved until he was no longer in sight.

Our first time was so difficult and trying for our second was nerve wrecking because we didn't know know if it would take us an entire year like it was the first time. After trying for about 3 months, my wife walked into our room to show me the pregnancy test. It was positive. I leaped from the bed and was so happy and gave her a bunch of kisses. My first born was up not to long after and we shared the amazing news to her not to long after. As a baby and even till today i font think she still understands that shes going to be a big sister. After a few months of going to the doctor,we found that the baby is in good health and that we will know the gender in no time at all. I was really hoping for a boy since our first born is a girl and would not mind a little fella to hang with. When we learned it was another girl it was almost as if it was like my first born. I did not care , i was no disappointed, I was going to have 2 little daddy's girls. I also felt like I have a chance to redo and enjoy my newborn since my family in a way ruined my new parent stage with their drama. It was a very rough period in my life and will never wish that on anybody. My wife and I then started prepping for the arrvial of our new daughter to come. We got a bunch of new books, toys the new nursery is actually just completed and are awaiting for her arrival (actually should happen sometime this week). We made a budget to try to get us out of some debt and get us ready financially for the arrival as we all know that having a baby can be a little expensive. Currently paid off 1 of our loans thanks to planning, saving and Mturk. I can't wait for our little one to come to the world soon.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN0ES6,,0.0,retold

Recently my daughter started calling me daddy and we have been able to interact with each other much more closely. We knew were ready for another baby (not financially) but we knew wanted to have new one come in. I told my wife I wanted to be surprised and she did the exact same thing when my first born was born. She woke me up and showed me the stick she just peed on. Funny i know but what was the first time a thought of happiness and scared was now a I'm ready and extreme excitement. 3 months later and this is where our story comes into play. I just learned that we were having another girl. Can you believe that? Sisters i thought to myself. The thought of my my little girls being best friends rand through my mind. Until i realized, how am i going to prepare with all this debt. I looked and looked online on how to make extra money. I found Mturk applied and got right to it. Paying for a new baby is never easy, even with most of the stuff already on hand. Our debt is still extremely high from living expenses and still haven't recovered from the first newborn. I knew i had to get this ball rolling and i worked and worked and slowly am seeing results from it. As the baby bump grows so does my nerves. I know I'm still not ready financially but i am just so happy to be a daddy of 2.  When baby 2 comes I KNOW that my life will change yet again but thats just the roller coaster of having a baby. First everything is fine, then nervous excitement then you prepare, as the time approaches you try to do as much as you can because once the baby is born all time is devoted to caring for it. I love being a dad and cant wait for round 2. I think i am way more prepared for it the second time around. but i guess we will see if that is actually the case.",3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN0ES6,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DEN0ES6,0.0,recalled

We built sand castles and just were running away from waves. We kept saying to our son ""oh no, the water gonna get you!"" and he would laugh and run away. He kept calling the ocean BIG WATER and it was so cute. We ate a lot of good food and we walked a lot. We really love walking on the boardwalk and just enjoy the breeze and the salty air.

The waves were pretty big the first day. One time he felt brave enough to run into the water without holding my hand and when he saw a big wave coming his way he didn't have enough time running away from it and it got him! He didn't cry but he kept telling us: ""Big water got me!"" It was so funny. Oh, We even saw some dolphins! It was quite special. We also spent a day with our friends who recently moved to Virginia beach. We went to this very small family owned restaurant together and it was truly a hidden gem! It doesn't look good from the outside but when you're inside you can feel this nice, friendly vibe. The food was also so delicious and they have THE BEST home made brownies I've ever had in my life!

I hadn't been feeling well the last week but I hadn't thought that it was increasing one of my pills daily that was making me sick. I had been taking this prescribed medicine for 13 years. I had gotten up to go to work and I know my sugar was running low. I tested and it was indeed low, but was still really tired. I decided to go back to bed since it was July 4th and I did not have to go to work. I didn't take any precautions like eating a carb or two to bring my sugar up. I went to bed and that was about the last thing that I remember. The next thing I do remember I woke up in the hospital in a bed with an IV in my arm. My sugar had been 33 when I had been brought in, which was almost coma level. I guess from what my husband said, I got up a while later and was acting screwy-if a person hasn't seen a hypoglycemic episode they might think the person was drunk. I guess I got up then fell in the bathroom, my husband came in and talked to me and said I wasn't making any sense. He finally got me up and then I walked to the living room and passed out on the floor. He finally got me up and dressed.

Metfornin is very typical and it's commonly used for diabetic patients to help regulate blood sugars. I have been taking Metfornin for 14 years since I had been determined to be a diabetic. The doctor increased my dosage of this drug to 3 daily instead of 2 which I did not think was a very big deal, I mean I had taken them for years with absolutely no problems.  I started getting sick, I thought it was taking blood pressure medicine.  I had ran out of blood pressure medicine about 2 weeks before I went to see my doctor. After I started taking the additional Metfornin I also started taking my blood pressure medicine and started having side effects like nausea and dizziness. I thought I had contracted the flu or blamed it on the blood pressure medicine. I was horribly ill and passed out after waking up on the 4th. I woke up in the hospital on July 4th.

Since plane tickets are so expensive, I thought it would be more economical to drive down to Florida with my four children.  We packed up the car and stayed one night at a hotel halfway there.  Once we arrived to my dad's house, a few family members came over to celebrate and visit with us.  During the week-long stay, we went to the beach, ate out a couple of times, and played with my dad's new puppy.  The kids had an excellent time and even collected some sea shells to bring home.  My dad and step-mother decided to surprise us with tickets to Walt Disney World.  I'm not sure I've ever seen my children so excited.  It was hot and crowded there, but it's a memory I wouldn't trade for the world.  My children had so much seeing the sites only viewed before on television.  They really had fun when the mascots would approach them.  Too soon, our trip was over and we had to head back home.  We tearfully said goodbye and started our car trip back.  Though we enjoyed our visit very much, we were very happy to be home.  My husband couldn't travel with us due to work, so we had something to look forward to when we got back.",3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ2G3O57,,0.0,retold

We spent the night there before boarding the ship. The cruise lasted for one week and included stops in Spain, France, and Italy. We went on excursions almost every day. The weather was very hot, as there was a heat wave in Europe. The buses we took for excursions had very little air conditioning, making the trips miserably hot. In general, we had fun, however the days were very long and tiring. The food on the boat was another negative part of the trip. We had many food allergies in the group, and they did not do a good job accommodating. I've been on other cruises where they over accommodated for allergies, but this ship did not meet those expectations.

I was so proud of her. And I was proud to be there. Honestly, the best part though was that my daughter and son reconnected. She asked him to be a witness. It was a big thing to do.

Watching my 5 year olds face light up at the sight of his favorite character (Stitch) is something I will never forget. The food was memorable for a different reason. On our fourth night of vacation, we ate at a restaurant called ""Chef Mickey's"" in the Contemporary resort. My wife had researched a lot for our trip and had warned me that we weren't going for a fabulous food experience as she had booked this restaurant solely for the purpose of the character experience for our son. Chef Mickey's is a buffet restaurant that features the ""fab 5,"" Mickey, Minnie, Donald, Pluto, and Goofy. It is an easy way to meet the characters without waiting in long lines in the parks. After being seated, we browsed the expansive buffet that winded around the restaurant. I marveled at the open concept of the restaurant which enabled patrons to view the monorails as they traveled through the hotel a few floors above. It is a quite impressive space. The food was typical buffet fare. I had low expectations so I was not bothered despite the steep price we paid. My wife and I decided to nibble on some boiled shrimp and have a cocktail then pick up a hamburger later on that evening because we were underwhelmed by the selections. My son enjoyed his selections of chicken and broccoli and the characters and then we returned to the parks. Before the fireworks even began that night, my wife and I both started feeling very ill. We spent the next day in our hotel room very, very sick. Luckily, my son did not catch anything. Our hotel desk was amazing and sent a doctor to our room. We were able to salvage the last two days of our vacation for our son's sake and we plan on going back next year but we will definitely never again eat at Chef Mickey's.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,,0.0,retold

It was an amazing time and we made so many memories that I know will stay with all of us forever. Since it was my 5 year old son's first trip to Disney World, we tried to make it extra special by booking a lot of character restaurants. On our arrival day, we ate dinner at Chef Mickey's. The food was terrible but the character interactions were well worth the lack of flavor and the price of our meals. Seeing my son's face light up when Mickey, Minnie, Donald, and Goofy came to our table to interact with him was priceless. He was so happy. The next morning before heading to the parks, we had breakfast at 'Ohana with Lilo, Stitch, and Mickey. Stitch is one of my son's favorite characters right now so he was literally speechless when he saw him roaming around the restaurant. His expression upon meeting Lilo was unexpected and the most precious thing I have ever seen. He held her hand and stared up at her like she was the greatest thing he had ever seen. I ended up ordering that print and will frame it. Later that night while taking a break from the Magic Kingdom, we ate at the T-Rex restaurant because my son is really into dinosaurs at the moment. That was a lot of fun but the food was sub par. On our 3rd day, we ate breakfast at 1900 park faire with Cinderella, Prince Charming, and the wicked step mother. It was a better food experience but my son was not very into the characters. That night, we ate at Garden Grill in Epcot with Chip and Dale. The food was sub par again but the characters were so much fun. All in all, we learned that park food, even in the restaurants is not very good. The lunches and dinners that we had in Disney Springs were amazing though. Our resort was just a short boat ride from Disney Springs so when we took a break from the parks around lunch time, I would run get lunch and bring it back to the resort while my son rested.",3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,0.0,recalled

My parents had arrived from overseas a few days prior, and my uncle and cousin drove from the country next-door to be with me. I was excited, more than I was trying to admit, or show. I don't like showing emotions, but sometimes my face betrays me.  I may have been the last one in the house to wake up, despite it being my graduation day. I could hear people going up and down the stairs getting ready. My boyfriend calls me and tells me he's on his way to pick me up and take me to the commencement ceremony, so I get up and start to get ready. I cannot decide what shoes to wear, so I go for my favorite pair that are light pink with flowers and wear a white dress. At this moment my boyfriend has arrived and is in the living room with my two uncles and my dad. It was his first time meeting my dad and the oldest uncle, which was to be honest kind of awkward for all of them. I put on the graduation gown, the cap and tassel on my hand and go downstairs and signal my boyfriend and cousin that we are ready to go. Before, I make sure to leave the ceremony tickets to my uncle to make sure that they have the ability to come there with no issues. We drive to my school, and I talk on the phone with my other friends who tell me that they are in the gown room, in line. I notify my boyfriend and cousin who were in line to go inside the audience, and I head out to the gown room. I find my name-card, my friends and I put on my cap and tassel and the time comes where we walk outside in rows and head for our seats in the podium. I remember thinking ""wow, this place is huge!"". I try to locate my cousin and boyfriend in the podium, which I succeed, after I call him on the phone. The ceremony starts, there are a lot of students graduating, and because our college was the last one, we had to wait for hours until it was our turn. However, now it feels as if it went pretty fast. Finally, our time to shine was almost there and our row gets up and starts heading to the podium. I could feel my legs shaking, and it was moving very fast. One by one the students were walking across, and it was finally me - I hand out my name-card to the caller, who surprisingly gets my name right, and I start heading towards the dean of my college and the president of the school, who shake my hand, congratulate me and hand me my diploma folder while taking a picture. I start heading out of the podium and I see my parents and uncles cheering me on, and I am so happy. The mos chilling moment that I had, was during the closing remarks, when the president guided us into turning the tassel from the left to the right side, to symbolize the end of an era of bachelors- I did and I still get the good chills. I will never forget how I felt - it actually makes me go back to school again just so that I can experience again the emotions of a commencement.",3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09KF8RIQ,,0.0,retold

I remember waking up excited and getting ready because in just a few hours I would be walking in the podium to the sound of people cheering at the call of my name. It was my graduation day. The day I had been waiting for ever since I started college. I would go to the website of my university all the time and look at previous commencement ceremonies and daydream about mine. That's how excited I was and how long I was waiting for it. All of my closest people were there - My parents, uncles and cousins, as well as my boyfriend. I felt extremely proud and happy to share these moments with them. Many of my college friends were graduating with me. It was fun to sit with them and chat about the day and what the plan would hold for us. It was also immensely happy to glance to the side and see my parents who flew overseas to be with me for that moment. I had finally graduated from a long and tiring phase, 5 years of school. I also was able to graduate with honors, and I was able to wear a medal around my neck which looked so good on me. I would not be able to explain the goosebumps I felt when I was called to walk to the podium, receive my diploma and take the picture with the Dean and the President of my School. Or hearing the people cheering at the sound of my name! I was surprised to hear that my name was pronounced correctly. Locals usually have difficulties pronouncing my name. The ceremony ended with, a lot of hugs, flowers and tears, as well as an after-party with all our loved ones and dearest friends.

They were something new to me, having only grown up with cats. There was a particular golden shepard that I felt an instant connection with. He was 3 years old. Through my time at AFL I learned he was available for adoption. After short consideration I knew I was in a comfortable place to bring a dog into my home.  I decided to adopt that golden shepard.

This week, we also had a double header and the league decided to make up the one that was cancelled from a few weeks prior. This meant that we were going to play four softball games in a row. This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't 95 degrees and humid. Just one inning into the game, we were all sweating buckets. We knew it was going to a be very long day. Still, we persisted and won our first game. Dripping with sweat and exhausted, we moved on to the second game. This game was much closer to the last, with signs of fatigue clearly showing on our faces. Normally, this would be the last game of the day. Sometimes, we only played one, but we advanced to our third of the day. A couple errors really brought the team down early in the game, but we managed to string along some runs via some great hits and couple home runs and brought our daily record to 3-0. With the finish line in sight, we walked over to another field to play our fourth and final game of the day. By now, the lights were on and a light drizzle began to fall. Usually rain was unwelcome, but on a day like that we all took it with open arms. Unfortunately, we weren't able to complete the undefeated day. We were bested by a good team that was playing their first game of the day, but no excuses! We could have pulled it off, but in the end I was honestly just happy to be heading home.",3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI0NQ6CA,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI0NQ6CA,0.0,recalled

Unfortunately, the weather did not permit and they ended up having to cancel the games. As luck would have it, the weekend they ended up having us play the previously scheduled double header, we also had a double header. This meant that we had to play four games in one day, the elusive quadruple header. This wouldn't be so bad, but it was on one of the hottest days of the summer and they scheduled them back-to-back-to-back-to-back. The first game went fine, though the entire team was already drenched in sweat and the sun continued to beam down from the heavens. It was about midway through the second game that I think we realized just how taxing this was going to be. Our spirits were still high, but we could all tell that it was going to be quite an intense experience by the end of it all. By the third game, we were just about spent. Luckily, we played a team that was around our skill level, so if I remember correctly, we were able to pull out a win. The last game, however, was another story entirely. The team had just gotten done with a tournament in a nearby town and were also exhausted. Their talent level far succeeded ours, further hurting our confidence. Some of their players were playing in Crocs and I don't think they even had a full team. We still got buried. They ended up ending the game early because of how many runs they were beating us by. I think we were just happy to be done. All in all, I don't even remember how many of those games we ended up winning versus losing, but the most memorable part was how our team stuck together through the radiating heat that we had to weather for four miserable hours. If there's one thing I learned about that day, it's that I absolutely love softball because I would do it all over again.",3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI0NQ6CA,,0.0,retold

We enjoyed the flames licking at the logs and the warmth spreading out from the fire. We made smores and had a few drinks, spending most of our time just talking laughing and joking about life. At my house I have motion sensor lights. One night when we were sitting in the back yard around the bonfire one of the motion sensor lights kept going on and off. The odd thing about this was that it had never acted that way before. Talk around the bonfire went to ghosts and spirits, we joked that there may be a ghost trying to get our attention. Laughingly she said ""We see that you are here and recognize your presence."" After that the light did not go on again. This was something that we both found interesting, it's like she acknowledged whatever was going on and it was happy to be acknowledged it. The night was uneventful after that but it was the topic of conversation for the next few days, even though we had bonfires after that, we didn't experience that situation for any of those other bonfires. The other thing we enjoyed tremendously was going to Ren Fest. It was hot and humid that day but we both dressed as different Steam Punk characters. There were so many different things to look at and enjoy, we got to experience the fire whip, the jousting and the comedy troop. We spent hours just going through the different shops, enjoying the wares that were sold. And the food, don't get me going on the turkey legs, we spent so much time stuffing our faces with the different specialty foods that when we came home we both joked we would need too go on a diet.

We clicked on a level I didn't think I would be able to click with someone else. I instantly felt a deep connection when meeting this person online. It was a pleasure to actually get to see her face, hug her and just talk to her in a real situation and it was fantastic to just be with her. I felt like a part of me that was missing was finally here. The first day we met, we went to the lake. It was wonderful to see her face as she realized the expanse of this lake. Playing in the water and collecting rocks for our rock hounding was so much fun. When we were done, we compared rocks and laughed over who found what and who had the prettiest. Sitting by the bonfire and just talking was so calming and peaceful. The heat of the fire, the flames burning bright in the dark night made for a surreal environment. Then going to ren fest, we both dressed up as different characters and boy did we laugh. It was hot outside and sticky but we had fun laughing and playing our roles.

However, the events leading up to the ceremony were pretty stressful. To start, the weather was lousy. We were having an outdoor wedding. It looked like it was going to rain, and it was already very windy. We were worried that some of the setup might just blow over from the wind. Also, we hit a lot of traffic going over to the venue, and I was already very stressed. My wedding dress also felt like it was not fitting right, even though it fit perfectly when I tried it on numerous times before. However, this could have been in my head, as I was already very stressed about the wedding and everything that was going on. It's not like I did not love my soon to be husband. Nor did I have second thoughts about it. On the contrary, I love him very much, and I was just looking forward to getting the ceremony started. When I finally walked down the aisle with my father and I saw my husband to be, I felt way better. Seeing him standing up there just seemed to alleviate all the stress. With that being said, the most surprising thing that happened was when the ring bearer tripped and fell. He quickly got up though, and he acted like nothing happened. It ended up not raining, and the wedding was relatively calm after that.",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCX8WQ0,0.0,imagined

This was nearly 4 months ago, and is still pretty fresh in my mind. It was a pretty good day, which started bright and early at 7 am for me and my friends. I had to get to the hair salon at 8am to get ready for hair and makeup. My friends were all tired, and I was as well. Mostly because I was super anxious and ready to get married finally. But it all went smoothly, and we were done in about 3 hours. We still had time to kill, so we went to grab lunch nearby. Then shortly after that we got ready to head to the church to finish getting ready for the wedding. Now that part was chaotic. My dad lost or misplaced parts of his suit rental. And, my dress which had fit previously the week before, was not closing up properly. Go figure, I ended up having to be sewed into my dress. Then it came time to get married finally. And all of the stress and anxiety went away the moment I saw my husband finally. It went very smoothly, even though our friend dropped our wedding rings. We said our vows and all that. And then after the ceremony was over we headed to the after party. There are alot of cherished memories that come along with that day. And, I'll never forget it.",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCX8WQ0,0.0,recalled

She was having trouble walking. Just yesterday she had seemed just fine. I immediately called our normal vet, who luckily had time to see my precious dog that very same day. I rushed her over to the vet. At first she thought it could be a pinched nerve or even simple dehydration. But she ordered an x-ray and my worst fears came true. My beautiful, loving, caring, spirited, wonderful, amazing dog had cancer. She had not one but three tumors on her spinal cord. The vet advised us that even with surgery, cancer in this location, these size tumors and multiple tumors had a very poor prognosis. Since my dog is twelve, my vet did not think we should operate. I made the painful choice not to do the surgery. I took my dog home and for the next week we pampered her, showered her with love and affection and gave her the best week of her life. After the week was over, we called a different vet, one that does house calls, because I wanted my dog to be put to sleep at home where she was comfortable. The vet came over and, surrounded by family, my companion for the past twelve years was put to sleep. I will never forget my precious dog, and I still miss her every day, but I keep on moving because I know that life and death are intertwined and it's something we all have to deal with and accept.",,3J88R45B2HKQ3F50NA3MP6N94G4XPT,0.0,imagined

We saved as much as we could and her parents were gracious enough to pay the rest of it off for us.  We sent out the invites to many people and we had about 125 attend the wedding.  Even at this number it was pretty expensive.  We found our officiant which was a close friend of the family.  Our ring bearers were also close friends of the family.  Our flower girls were my nieces.  They looked so pretty all dressed up.  On the day of the wedding I was very nervous.  I could not wait to marry this beautiful woman and make her my wife.  My stomach was in knots.  When I first saw her tears came to my eyes and I was crying she looked amazing.  At the reception We got pretty drunk and had a great time dancing and enjoying everyone's company.  Right after the wedding we went on our honeymoon to Cabo.  We had fun there as well and really got to relax and enjoy life.  We got to go swimming we went on a tour to see old Mayan ruins and temples.  We also went parasailing and rode horses.

It was my wife's first time meeting him, as he lives a great distance away.  She hit it off with them very well, and we were both very thankful for not only them, but the way the event unfolded. He definitely fit in well and made for an enjoyable time. He has a sense of humor that is like mine and very raw, and it's pretty constant. He was telling jokes to everyone, and everyone seemed to appreciate it, except for one person, but I won't waste the time to add them into this. My wife and I have already discussed and are planning a trip to go visit him and his family in the coming year.  His family and my family have begun to forge a bond that I hope will last a lifetime.  It was overall a very joyous and memorable day. I couldn't be happier, and am very thankful that my wife accepted him in such open arms.

As one would expect, it was a very significant step, and a very special moment in my life.  We opted to not go too overboard, and had under 100 guests total.  Everything went very well, and the memory of that day will stay in my mind, and I'll cherish it for the rest of my life.  Besides our immediate family, I had my best friend come up from across the country to be my best man. I absolutely love him and his family, and cherish every moment we get to spend together. I don't get to see him too often, so when I do I take full advantage and try to enjoy every moment as much as possible.  Not only did he come with his daughter and wife, but his parents were there as well, as they are very important to me.  I was overwhelmed with the amount of people we had there, and probably felt as loved and important as I ever have in my life on account of all the people there. The only part that was a bit bothersome was with it being a wedding, and so many people, I didn't get much time to chat with each person, as I would have liked to. I've come to realize that's just how weddings are with so many people and only so much time, that it's part of the gig.  But beyond that, it was an amazing experience, and I enjoyed myself a great deal. My wife looked gorgeous (as usual), and I am overly thankful to spend the rest of my life with her.  The photographer did an excellent job, and I helped her out by being a joker and keeping people laughing and smiling which helped with pictures. It was a great day, and I am still ecstatic that I got to share our special day with such great people.  The caterer did fantastic, and the venue we used was absolutely perfect, and extremely affordable.  It did rain a little bit, but we managed to dodge the brunt of it, which was good as we had planned and hoped to have it outdoors.

I also got my hours at work reduced before Christmas and I just wanted to stay home and pull the covers over my head. Kelly text me and said she and Benji were going to see a show that night and they had an extra ticket if I wanted to go. I really didn't but I missed Kelly's birthday party in November and I was feeling guilty about it so I felt I could say no again so I grudgingly went along. The band was called Kero Bonito and I only knew them a little. I have seen their stuff on a few Stopify playlists but wouldn't call myself a fan. The night was a bit boring really and the warm up acts were terrible. Several times I just wanted to leave because it wasn't my scene. Well, Kero Bonito are a much better live band because when they did come out they just smashed it. They were fantastic and they put on one of the best shows I have ever been to. I forgot all about my problems and just let go for the first time in weeks. I was dancing and singing (had to make up some lyrics!) and just acting like a big goof. I swear just allowing myself to be happy and to focus on the moment was so badly needed. It was like a religious experience. I just felt like I was in my body and felling all my feelings rather than being in my head thinking and thinking and thinking (negatively) like I've been doing the past few weeks. I'm not sure if this is me turning over a new leaf but I do think the feeling has carried into my life and things don't feel so bleak now. Sometimes, we just have to get out of our heads but it's not easy. Hopefully it's the start of better things to come?",,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKMO1EVL,0.0,imagined

I knew my first post had to be exciting.  I made it about one of my favorite quarterbacks.  The podcast ended up getting a lot of views.  Many people commented on it.  Even professionals commented on it.  I did a great job.  I will keep doing my podcast.  I'll keep getting better.",3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO,0.0,recalled

She inviting some of her friends from school to celebrate.  We had about 10 kids total come.  We celebrated by having a pinata for the kids to hit, a hula hoop competition; it was really fun!  I made the party as girly as possible.  There was a lot of pink decorations, like flamingos placed around. One of the gifts she received was a play make-up kit which she used during the party to dress up herself and her friends.  She really liked that.  We had a ton of sweets at the party and even had a cotton candy maker there.  This birthday was a very special birthday!  We (at the time) lived in a house that had very little land.  Our family had always dreamt of having our very own hobby farm.  My husband and myself had worked hard for years to make sure this dream would become a reality.  My daughter, had always wanted her very own horse.  She has asked us to get her a horse ever since she was very little.  Unfortunately, we were not able to afford the care and board of a horse if it was not on our own property.  My husband and myself went house hunting to find the perfect hobby farm to surprise our daughter with for her birthday.  Then, to let her know that her dream of owning a horse would soon be true.  We found a cute house that had 10 acres, enough for a couple of horses if we truly wanted.  At her party we were able to surprise her with the news!  She was so excited she could hardly contain herself.  To most young girls, they wouldn't even think of aspiring to have the simplicity in life. She wanted to connect with animals and nature.  Now were were providing that to her.   It was a birthday to remember!",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,,0.0,retold

We were just having a simple family party, but we were taking it to the next level.  I wanted to make it fun and lively.  I purchased a bunch of pink flamingo decor to decorate the walls and tables.  I purchased a cute flamingo puffy straw to adorn the party cups.  I played music by Marshmello, who is her favorite musician.  For her gifts, I purchased her a bunch of squishes, and some play make up.  We had all of her cousins come, which totaled about 10 kids.  We had games like pinata hitting, hula hoop competition, and limbo.  Her cake I decorated pink and purple with many pastel colored sprinkles.  This birthday was a large celebration as she has always dreamed of having a horse again.  Unfortunately, our property is small and we could no longer afford the board in our area for a horse.  So, we sold the one we had years ago.  This year, I was able to gift her with something that most people wouldn't even think would matter to a young girl.  I was able to tell her we were buying a house out in the country that had enough acreage for a horse!  She was over the moon excited.  Our little half acre lot that we lived in would eventually turn into 10 acres in our new home.  She would have the room to ride and play like she had always dreamt of doing.",3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQXXLU9H,0.0,recalled

She understands that faith in God makes hard things possible. She wrote us about it and quoted this from one of our church leaders: This is a vivid illustration of the truth expressed by President Russell M. Nelson: “When the focus of our lives is on … Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening﻿—or not happening﻿—in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him."" She has helped us through this as much as we have helped her. She has reminded us that everyone’s situation is different, and the details of each life are unique. Nevertheless, I have learned that there is something that would take away the bitterness that may come into our lives. There is one thing we can do to make life sweeter, more joyful, even glorious.

She is enjoying the ride and looking out the window. The bus then abruptly stops and she was thrown forward in her seat. Fred then walks on to the bus and sees, that the only seat left is the one next to Daisy. Fred sat down with a huff and he began to make himself comfortable. The bus then began to move and they were back on the road. For the next hour of the ride, Daisy was looking out the window until, Fred turns to her and says that his name is Fred. This takes Daisy by surprise and causes Daisy to become a little more happy about the whole thing. Even though it was a better reaction,than she got the first time she still did not trust Fred so she just ignored him. She waited about 10 minutes and felt bad for avoiding Fred so she turned his way. She suddenly notice that he was sleeping before she could asking him a few questions. With this now known, Daisy happily fell asleep knowing that she had made a new friend. A half an hour later, Daisy woke up to the sound of the road. Daisy sat up straight and found Fred reading his newspaper. Throughout art history there have been many artists who refer back to mythological figures and tales as artistic inspiration. Mythological stories, as well as the ideas of classic history, became increasingly reverted back to with the start of Neoclassicism. Rationality and tradition were rediscovered and implemented into artwork more frequently in the mid-eighteenth century; these key thoughts made up the ideals of Neoclassicism; the classical revival in European art. One of the great artists of the time was Baron Francois Gerard, whose oil painting of Cupid and Psyche in 1798 represented a true masterpiece of the Neoclassical period due to its overall focus on the main characters in the narrative while integrating powerful symbolism and creating a high quality of realism. Baron Francois Gerard’s 1798 painting of Cupid and Psyche portrays Psyche sitting on a grassy hill-like area. She is shown with a very vacant and far-off gaze as if observing something in the distance. Her posture is relaxed yet her arms are almost in a folded position over her bare body. Cupid is right next to her and has his arms wrapped around her carefully as to not touch her. His gaze is right at her face and has a look of longing in his eyes. Cupid carries his set of arrows around his right arm between his golden falcon wings.",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRYWYLND,0.0,recalled

Made even busier towards the end with preparing the kids to return to school.  One going back to her senior year the other to his sophomore year. Lucky for us they attend the same school, which does seem to make events like this a little easier. I can not imagine having to take them to other sides of the United Staes to go to school ,with different climates different start dates, different holidays..  That would be hard .  It is nice to know your children were returning to the schools they choose to attend. They were returning to an enivornment they knew. They were going back to the arms of friends and even teachers they knew and had grown to care for. The drive home was long. The empty car held no chatter bugs. No one fighting over In N' Out or Chick filet. The radio didn't even play.  Silence.

Our daughter on the other hand was off and running and could'nt get rid of us fast enough. I returned to a quiet house with the dogs wondering where everyone had gone.

But living states apart had made meeting prior not been possible. We spent a lot of time ""talking"" but I didn't even know how her voice sounded. I felt very nervous on the way up, worrying that we might not ""click"" quite the same face to face. I remember feeling quite panicky and almost turning around to go home. It was a long drive up, plenty of time to worry. Even pulling into the parking spot at the event center, my heart was racing! As soon as we found each other, though, there was a big hug, and all was well. My worries melted away and for the first time in hours, I was able to lax. Even her dogs seemed like old friends-just as she'd told me they'd be! It was like we picked up right where the last conversation ended, and the rest of the day was spent having great fun together. We watched the dogs race and shared the experience, laughing and telling stories and even reminiscing about some of the things we shared. I was a little surprised just how natural it all felt. We were already planning the next meetup by the time I left to head home. I was left feeling a lot more confident about getting out of the house and meeting people/engaging with my friends--we even made a couple of new ones while we were there!",3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1W9KOH,,0.0,retold

We'd been in touch via social media for ~three years prior and this meeting felt like the culmination of our friendship. I met my friend through our shared mutual interest in dogs/preservation breeding, and it was a dog sporting event that we traveled to. Her dogs compete in FastCAT, a sort of dog race, and my partner and I planned our weekend around it. Driving up, I was more than a little bit nervous. It was in the back of my mind that we might not ""click"" the same way in person. What if she didn't like me? What if her dogs didn't like me? I was a bit of the wreck the whole trip, talking too much and feeling very jittery. Once we arrived, it didn't take long to find her. The first thing she did was grab me and give me a big hug, and it was like all of my worries just kind of melted away. She sounded exactly the way I expected her too, and I very quickly picked up on some of her familiar mannerisms/her same since of humor. It was definitely emotional to finally be able to put a real live face with her name, and the day turned out to be a lot of fun. The dogs were just as cute, if not more, in person, and I felt like I connected with them too. Getting to cheer on the sidelines at the event in person is something that no amount of texting/messaging could replace, and I remember feeling very glad that I'd gone. I was already looking forward to the next trip by the time we left, and although I felt a little bit sad as we drove away, there was a sense of peace and fulfillment in place of all of the initial anxiety.",3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1W9KOH,3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAH1W9KOH,0.0,recalled

We had grown apart as the years had gone on.  She had become a lot more cold towards me & had started to ignore or delay responding to me. When I told her it was over she started crying & got really emotional which surprised me. I didn't think she'd even care the way she'd been acting. I knew there was no changing my feelings or mind so it didn't effect me. She had just made me numb towards her. She had been taking me for granted & I could tell she didn't really care anymore. We had been seeing & talking to each other less & less. We were having less sex & she just didn't seem too into me anymore. I'm too proud to be in that kind of relationship. I still have positive feelings for her but have no urge to talk to her or be a part of her life. My grandmother had just died so maybe that made the whole thing seem small in comparison. I wish she had shown the emotion she showed when I told her I was leaving when I was around. That would have been nice.,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4C7MNJVX,,0.0,retold

It didn't have any effect on me. I had just become hardened to her. I didn't want the relationship to continue & told her I didn't even want to be her friend.

We first saw him when she saw a post on Facebook from the local animal shelter. She sent me a picture of the dog. He was very thin and looked very sad. We both felt very sorry for the dog. My wife saw the dog a week after we had moved into a new house. We had talked about getting another dog after we moved but ultimately decided against it. Our older dog is jealous of attention given to other dogs. We thought that he would be happier as an only dog. So when we first saw the dog at the shelter we talked about donating money to his care if he was picked up by a rescue group. However a few hours later neither of us could stop thinking about him. We called the shelter and were told that the dog needed more care than they could provide and that he wouldn't be kept there any longer. We decided that we had to go pick him up. We took the dog to a vet. They determined that he would need a blood transfusion but that it should wait until the following morning as the vet wasn't sure if he would survive the night. The next day the dog was given a blood transfusion. We were then able to take him home a few days later. We named him Pablo. Several months later he has gained weight and is more than twice the weight he was when we got him. He rather quickly adjusted to living with humans and has learned to use the bathroom outside. He is friendly and loving. Though he does still bite occasionally and is scared of strangers.,,3KJYX6QCMAX2DFX7SIXK4P4CRTAVJU,0.0,recalled

It's on me to have clarified what exactly that meant. And I didn't. The night of, I had planned to put everyone in Ubers to get them to the restaurant. It's worked before and was no problem. I get the first round of people in Ubers and start to call for another, when one of the agent representatives that accompanied two of our guests said, ""We should just take the hotel shuttle. It's free."" Now, I knew that I shouldn't have agreed. My gut told me that it was easier and more direct to take an Uber and there were hotel guests being dropped off at a concert across town and that would impact us. But I agreed. Like an idiot. The ride took almost an hour, when, had we taken an Uber, it would have been 10 minutes. Half of the guests were waiting at the restaurant for us. People were hungry, I was cranky and panicking. This was going badly. Service at the restaurant, once we arrived, was not great. Food came out in weird waves, drinks were left unfilled. It was not a great look. Worse, still, was the presentation of the check. To me. She had taken about $50 off a $350 bill. The celebrities kicked in money, which was not the plan, and I picked up the rest. It was awkward and weird and unpleasant in a way that made the rest of the night just 'off.' I didn't go back there for months.",3KRVW3HTZO7CMVMO1K579UCMMNFMSM,,0.0,retold

""We can all take the hotel shuttle. It'll be fun. It'll be free."" I put a couple of people in an Uber, and waited for the shuttle to come back to take us to the restaurant. Now, an Uber at most would have been $15. We had reservations at 8. There is one hotel van. There is a big, rednecky concert that night in town. While the shuttle is dropping off people across town, we wait. It's annoying. We had to wait for one of the people in the shuttle to go back to his hotel room because he forgot his wallet. Instead of getting there at 8, like the reservations said, it was 8:45. Half of the guests were there, waiting for us. It was deeply awkward. It was super annoying.Once we all got there, dinner came out in waves. Some orders were quite wrong and some orders were skipped entirely. Service was spotty. Then, when the bill came ""take care of us"" turned into, ""give you $50 off a $300 check."" So I had to cough up money to cover this and I'm certainly not getting paid for it.

I had to force myself to hold back the tears.  I didn't want him to be sad.  I wanted him to look forward and be excited for this day.  We had read the book ""The Kissing Hand"" the night before to remind him that I love him and will be with him.  He was a little scared about the day.  I remember holding his hand and walking him up to the doors and down the hall to his classroom.  You could see all of the other parents doing the same thing.  I gave him a big hug and walked him into the classroom.  I was at a loss for words and was surprised when he turned to me and reassured me it would be ok.  His teacher showed him where his desk was as I waved goodbye to him.  I could feel my eyes start to tear up as I turned to leave.  I made it out to my car before I let go of the tears.  I went home and waited.  I couldn't wait to hear about his day.  Thankfully it was an early day.  I waited outside of the school anxiously looking for my son.  I finally saw him and waved to him.  I was happy to hear that he had a great day and met some new friends.  He said it was scary but also fun.  I was so relieved that he had a good first day.

He was someone I was very close to growing up. I spent a lot of time with him throughout the years. His funeral was Saturday. I wasn't sure of the nature of how the funeral proceedings would be as it was handled by his children (my parent, and her siblings). However, I wanted to say something in his honor at the funeral. On Friday night, which was the night before the funeral, I could not sleep and decided to write out a remembrance. I have a fear of speaking in public, but I wanted to do itso badly that I committed myself to doing it anyway. During the funeral, a religious gentleman who had come to know him recently gave the service and eulogy. After he finished, he did not ask if anyone would like to say anything - the attendees started getting up and moving around - I immediately went up and asked everyone for a few moments for me to say some words. During this time, I was afraid I was being inappropriate, but I really wanted to honor my grandfather. I waited a few moments for everyone to go back to their seats. Most all sat back down, and a few stood attentively where they were at. I spoke my tribute to him and afterwards I was pleasantly surprised by how much it was appreciated. People rushed up to give me a hug and thank me. I felt so happy that it was both appreciated and that I pushed myself to do it regardless of how doubtful I was about doing it.",3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJABQINU6,3L2IS5HSFB4YJQZS2QF71AJABQINU6,0.0,recalled

They took me to a steak dinner where we got to know each other.  A few weeks later, I received an offer.  I acccepted the offer on Monday.  Today I gave my notice today at my job.

Im not one of those people I fell you should never forget especially when a person refuses to give you closure. I remember I asked her one year about my childhood and she said God has already forgiven me for the things that have happened to you. I stood there shocked thinking well dont you think you should want forgiveness from me too. But of course I got nothing not even a sorry . So no she will not be able to see my kids.  Just so they should be come attached and  maybe become victims of the same abuse I did. That would make me a responsible. Because I Know what she is capable of. Even if others are fooled by her sweetness. She always talkes about chursh and loving god but where was that love when i was little. Surely god saw what you did to me .

The adults were talking and laughing. My brother was manning the grill. I made it a point to spend some time talking and catching up with everyone there. The food was great. We had burgers, hot dogs, chicken, potato salad, garden salad, stuffed mushrooms (one of my favorite foods) and ears of corn. Eventually, they brought out the birthday cakes. There was a big cake for everyone to share and a small cake just for my nephew. He promptly smashed his face right into that little cake, which had everybody laughing. After all of the eating was done, we watched the birthday boy tear into his presents. As the sun started to set, we lit a fire in the outdoor fireplace and sat around it talking while the kids toasted marshmallows and made s'mores.

Christ knows how he got that.   Anyhow, she was of the opinion that maybe we ought to just put him down right then and there, but instead of that she gave me some pain medication for him and home we went.

One morning though it was just time, and we both knew it, so I carried him down to the normal vet and that was that.  His ashes are in a little box now.  On the kitchen table actually.

The ceremony was held outside in a lovely garden which opened up to a large field with a hugh white podium decorated so elegantly with white flowers.  The other members of the wedding party did not wear formal wear as did the groom and bride which was a nice contrast.  They instead wore ballerina wear.  The backdrop of the white chairs on the green grass was also very lovely.  It was a very sunny day so the brightly colored umbrellas that were handed out as we entered the garden as a nice touch.  The reason the event was so memorable to me was because it brought together a lot of my other cousins whom I had not seen in many years.   I have very happy to have the opportunity to see one cousin in particular that I had not seen since we were little girls.  I could not believe how much she resembled herself as a girl so there was no problems identifying her at all.  We exchanged cell phone numbers and promised to stay in touch, something I plan to do as we are both getting older every day.  The other main reason my cousin's wedding stood out for me was seeing my elderly aunt, (bride's mother) who is well into her 80's now, attend the event and enjoy the day.  She has had a few health scares and it was really good that she could attend and be a part of the festivities.  I also think it did everyone good to sit outside in the sun while breathing in air freshened by all the foliage that surrounded us.  My cousin usually goes for either very flashy men or men who depend on woman more than they should, however, this time around, she chose someone who stands on his own and who enjoys a simple life being with the one he loves.  We all can see the love they have for each other which made the day that much more enjoyable knowing that finally, she has chosen well as she moves into the middle stage of her life.",3L6L49WXW1JVC3Z7JKS3UPLUF90549,3L6L49WXW1JVC3Z7JKS3UPLUF90549,0.0,recalled

While the bulk of the work was in the spring, the preparation had gone back months. Early on in the preparations for it, the principals had told me I needed to include younger grade levels. In years past, it had only been for 5th and 6th grade, with some older middle schoolers helping out as volunteers. Most of the activities in the past were aimed at older elementary and middle school students, so including younger kids really concerned me. I was worried that it was going to add a lot of extra preparation work because I had to come up with activities that could reasonably include them. Even in the official science olympiad competitions, their suggested activities are for much higher grade levels. I also was concerned because I really wanted it to come off well because I was trying to get my old job back as a full time science teacher. At the time I was primarily teaching math, which they had moved me to, but I did not like that job. So I put a lot of time in to find the right activities to do that all grade levels could enjoy and be engaged with. It was done with the intent that even if some of them were challenging, they were of the sort that the older kids could easily help the younger ones and keep them interested. Regardless, it still took a lot of hours outside of regular school hours. It was all I did in my spare time in the weeks leading up to it. I had to write all the directions, purchase and organize all the materials, communicate with all other staff members and volunteers who were running events. I had to create individual schedules for all students involved and make sure directions were clear enough for all to move successfully to different events. In the end, despite my fears that the younger kids would be too young and also too poorly behaved to be able to handle it, they did well.  It ended up being a major success that was recognized, and whether it had anything to do with it or not, I ended up getting my original position back as a science teacher, which made me (and still makes me) happy.",3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMJ80ADI,,0.0,retold

I was the only one working on it despite the fact that they added additional grade levels to the event. It had originally just been fifth and sixth grade, but this most recent year they added third and fourth grade in as well. This made it more challenging because being younger, they are obviously at a different stage of development than fifth and sixth graders. Organizing academic events, including engineering-related and computer science-related events that would work across all grade levels added to the challenge. Plus, I was organizing it all by myself. So I had to come up with the list of events, buy and organize all of the supplies, create and write all the directions, and organize all the teams across grade levels in a balanced fashion. The latter was probably the most challenging part because I don't know all of the grade levels, and so I don't know the kids very well, and their teachers weren't overly helpful at providing information about them. Regardless, we got to the day of, and I had been very stressed. I didn't think it would turn out well because of all the challenges and the high variety in grade level. At the last minute I found out that a local politician, a state congress person, had even been invited to the event, so I was extra stressed about that as well. However, it all ran much better than I expected. The kids all had a great time, the teachers were very supportive during the events themselves, and most importantly the older kids helped support the younger students in positive ways. Even though it was a competitive event, they made sure the younger students were included. The principals and superintendent were very happy with how it worked out, and it helped lead to me getting my original job back as primarily a science teacher rather than teaching math for the bulk of my instructional time. That made me happy most of all that going forward, I am going to be able to teach what I am most passionate about, and I was able to get that back on the basis of my hard work and efforts.",3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMJ80ADI,3L70J4KAZH85I5UH7RKD54VMJ80ADI,0.0,recalled

My cousin, the son of my mother’s oldest sister, has gotten engaged. It’s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom’s side — granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it’s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around.[12:04 PM, 8/26/2019] Debman: It’s not that we’re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It’s that my cousin’s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai.

My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak.

People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn’t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese.

Some people would say that ""a car is just a car"" and there is no reason to get emotional about it, however, my car was more than just an object or a means to get around.  My car represented me and my true personality. In my youth, I worked extra hard to purchase my dream car, I took all types of odd jobs and made sacrifices to make it happen. It was not easy because I just graduated college and did not make a lot of money, however, I was determined to work extra hours in order to make my dream come true.  I still recall how good it felt when I first drove to my apartment in my brand-new car and pulled in front of my building! I felt so proud, like I was on top of the world and nothing could stop me.  Those were the happy days but life has a way of changing in unpredictable manner. They always say that if you want to make God laugh, tell Him about your plans. We face both, moments of triumph and failings.  I got married, became a father, became a father again, lost a job, found a job, and lost one again. Family became a priority above cars and other non-essential possessions.  I hit hard times and had to say goodbye to my beloved car. I did not want to wake up that morning, knowing that I would have to take it out of the garage for the last time and watch some strangers load it unto a trailer and drive away into the unknown.  It felt like closing a favorite book, filled with chapters representing a happy part of my life that I could never get back again.

I had to sell it because I lost my job and I had to save my family home from foreclosure until things get better again. I dreamed about this car since I was a boy of seven while looking at car magazines with my school buddies.  One day I came home from school and told my mom and dad that some day this car would be mine. They just laughed at my naive childhood dreams, they were simple country ""folk"", living in rural Texas. My was father a strict military man, stationed at a Fort Hood army base, and certainly not interested in fast cars or any ""fancy"" things like that. He would say that such things were a ""foolish waste of time and money"" and that a man's job is not to own ""fancy"" things but to serve his family and put bacon and bread on the table. However, I  was a free spirit, quiet different from my parents and their ways. I followed my dream of the ""super car"" and purchased my corvette when I turned twenty-two with my own hard-earned money. I loved my car all these years, not as a fancy object that I would show off to others, but a symbol of my own hard work and dreams. It represented my character and ""together"" we went through some many memorable experiences in life.  It was a very tough and heartbreaking decision to sell it, however, I had to do it for my wife and my two children. Their well-being and comfortable is much more important to me than any sentimental object-even my ""super car"". I told myself that when things turned around again, I could always get another one. Cars can be easily replaced but a family happiness in once in a lifetime. My heart broke when I took it out of the garage for the last time and handed the keys to a young man who came to purchase it all the way from Salt Lake City, Utah, with his father. I looked at his face and saw his eyes shining with excitement. he reminded me of myself when I first got my car, a dreamed who reached his goal! I wished him good luck and I hope that he will enjoy it as much as I did all these years. I felt very sad, however, it was priceless when my five-year-old son ran into my arms and said : ""Dad, when I grow up, I will buy you the faster car ever and we will fly!"".",3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUZ97GLB,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUZ97GLB,0.0,recalled

I changed a lot of things because of that, and once I got out of the psych ward in hospital I've put a request for change of shift. Since then I started working out, changed my diet and got back to school. It was difficult and mind numbing. And now, a couple weeks ago, my boss called me to a meeting. There he told me that I'm getting a shift that I wanted, but on top of that I will get a promotion. It is small, nothing significant, to be honest. But still there's a pay raise and some new responsibilities for me. I was over the moon about these news. And at first I couldn't believe it... So I didn't change my routine or anything, I was in sort of denial. But then the day came, of my new schedule and new position. I was nervous and scared, I don't know of what. But I started going to bed when normal people do, I finally had time to walk around in the sunlight. And I immediately started feeling much better. I'm really happy that this happened to me.

The child spends most of her time with me. Over the past few months CPS has twice assigned me as a guardian protector of sorts of the child due to her mother.  Her mother has now been diagnosed with a mental disorder and is being watched closely for that and for drug use.  It's hard having them all in the home.  I have been trying to help all of them.  I try to help the mother to understand how to be a mother and to keep clean of drugs. I try to help the baby to be healthy mentally and physically. I also spend time trying to help my son to be strong enough to raise the child on his own if he has to.  This morning I cleaned up the baby bottles and high chair. It is something I do every day as the mother does not understand keeping things clean.  I just got through feeding the baby lunch.  I'll be alone with her until about six tonight.  In truth, I am a sort of part time mother to her.  It will soon be time to put her down for a nap.  I have grown close to her. I hope every day that she has a bright and safe future.

There were around 8 years during which we never talked because of an argument within the family. We spent a lot of time wondering if the relationship would ever get better. When Jill came into town two years ago and wanted to me, I was shocked. We reconnected and felt like no time had passed at all. When we received an invitation to her wedding, it felt like the sky had finally cleared. We were all so excited to fly in from out of town and be part of the wedding. Jill looked absolutely beautiful in her dress. It was so touching to see my uncle walk her down the aisle. Her sister was her maid of honor and the love between them was visible. The entire wedding was lovely from start to finish. The only really unexpected part was my aunt getting terribly drunk. She danced like crazy and then threw up on a table.

I pulled over and walked up to the little guy.  I was hoping that he had a tag on him with his address so I could just walk him home.  He didn't have a collar on at all, probably got hung up on something then he slipped it off.  He was kind of scraggly, unkempt and looked like he was starving.  Luckily I had a sandwich I had picked up for later in the saddlebag.  He was really friendly, like he had a good home at some point.  Wasn't aggressive at all, just being happy to have something to eat.  I couldn't really tell what breed he was but he was some kind of hound mix.  While he happily followed me I knocked on the doors of the few houses that were near to see if he was anyone's pet.  Of course, nobody could claim him.  I knew if he were left alone it was a matter of time before he got hit by a car.  I asked an elderly gentleman if the dog could stay in his garage until I got my bike back home and could come back with a car.  He agreed and that's how I ended up with a new dog.

I had to work the day of the date which was fine I would be off work with plenty of time, and it would make it so I didn't overthink what I was doing and make me nervous. I decided to take a shower around an hour and a half before I left so my hair was fully dry and I wouldn't look weird. I brushed my hair after getting out of the shower and got the clothes I was wearing to the date on. I then decided to chill out until it was time to leave, since I didn't want to walk around thinking about what I should do. I wanted to act natural and like I planned everything in advance. It came time to leave and I headed out to the restaurant we were meeting at. I got there pretty much as she got there and we took our seats at the table. We both ordered and then talked while we were waiting for the food to come out. I thought we were at least somewhat making a connection, since we had some similar interests. I learned enough about her that I definitely would have gone on a second date with her if she wanted to. The conversation died down a bit when the food came out because we were both pretty hungry.  As we were both getting down eating I had to use the restroom, so I excused myself. The floors must've been wet in the bathrooms or by our table because as I was walking back I slipped and fell face first into our table. I landed right on the corner and busted my forehead open and started bleeding. As if that wasn't bad enough, I also spilled what was left of our dinners and drinks onto both of us. I started apologizing right away to the girl, but there is only so much apologizing while having a busted open forehead can do. I ended up going to the hospital and getting stitched up. She never responded to if she wanted another date and I don't really blame her for that.",3LS2AMNW5GCO9ISNMWVF6YMQYCQQOM,,0.0,retold

This was to float what many consider the whole length of the buffalo national river in one shot. This trip is 130 miles long and should have taken between 8 to 11 days depending on how much paddling and sightseeing i chose to do along the way. Though i didn't intend on doing this trip by myself that is what happened do to my friend being hurt and unable to go. I set off on the upper part of the river knowing it could be dangerous. i had never been on this part of the river and the water was very low but i was determined to do what id considered the beginning to the end. I was very nervous about this as i found low water to be more dangerous than normal float levels. The first 15 miles or so i was very careful not to run through anything i deemed to dangerous. I met several very nice people along the way and actually camped overnite with people twice in the 5 nights i was on the river. This is a trip i will never forget as i had nearly perfect weather for the time i was on the river. Unfortunately after the 6th day i had to abandon my trip as we had a flooding rain coming in that night and it wasn't worth the risk to try and ride it out until water levels dropped to decent floating conditions. To this day it still bothers me i wasn't able to complete the trip and i will try again this year i hope. I will never forget this experience as it was and is one of my most fond memories and experiences i have ever done in my life. Just an incredible beautiful experience.,3M0NZ3JDP2KBF0NW4DITOLY3MK6Z5K,,0.0,retold

Luckily most times i ended up amongst groups of other floaters. I had the opportunity to meet some very nice people and actually was invited to camp twice in 5 nights.

She married a man that was perfect for her and of course wanted everything to look great and go well for her on her ""special day"". I might add that the ceremony itself was quite lovely and it did indeed go without a hitch.  Later on while celebrating after the ceremony, I being very clumsy spilled red wine on her beautiful white gown.  It was very lovely and I could not believe that something like this could happen!  This is something she no doubt spent quite a lot of money on, and would later need to spend quite a lot of money to get professionally cleaned. This isn't the first time that I have done something so clumsy. I cannot even say that I was overly drunk as I don't drink that much or very often.  It was more a case of me tripping over something I am sure.  We were both very shocked when it happened. I offered to pay for the dress as I knew that it would be quite costly.  She at least did not seem to be too distraught and laughed it off. I am just very fortunate to have her as my sister. It could have gone much differently if she became enraged or upset that she couldn't have the most perfect of days. She did take it in stride and of course being my caring sister did her best to calm me down - I am pretty sure I was more concerned and distraught then she was.

The most memorable party of the whole thing was when I got to our area and saw the decorations and everyone shouting ""Happy Birthday"" as I recognized their faces.  I had a wonderful dinner with 30 friends and family. We ended the evening with drinks and desert, and my significant other ad I headed out for a night on the town. That was definitely one of my most memorable birthdays. I really felt cared for. Before then, I never would have expected that many people to want to show up to my party.  It was endearing to know that my love had gone through all of that to plan something for me. They aren't typically a planner, so that made it even more special. The place at ate was delicious. Our waiter was excellent and he kept everyone happy throughout the meal. I have bee back 4 times since then. I received so many presents that day.",,3M23Y66PO3TAXS1WE4YQKYF0PKE6SX,0.0,recalled

He had trouble breathing, and he had been in the emergency room since a week ago. I assumed for the worst, hoped for the best. My uncle had throat cancer for about a year now. He couldn't speak with the majority of his tongue removed. My cousin, his son, said he realistically had limited time, about a week. I lived with their family for a while when I was young. I could hear the words, but it just didn't register. If that's the case, I couldn't imagine what they were feeling. And, just like that, a week later, he died. I woke up in a groggy state from a phone call. He said ""my dad passed away earlier this morning."" And for the next few days, it's just been a gloomy state. We had the funeral shortly afterwards as well as attending services. I'm fine, but it's just weird knowing someone you knew your entire life is gone, just like that. I can come visit their house...but the body is gone. And my other family members are freaking out because he is the youngest from the brothers and sisters. It just makes you realize you can die at any given moment and to just live your life. You can die in twenty-five years, or you can die today. So while it's not about the length of time you lived, it's what you did in that lifetime. As Abraham Lincoln stated,""it's not how many years you lived but how you lived in those years.""",3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRT24BQG,3M81GAB8A154QO3EIRQT0EMRT24BQG,0.0,recalled

With the right personal touches, maid of honor speeches for a sister can be a heartwarming expression of love, support, and friendship between a bride and her sister............... Make sure to practice ahead of time so that you can concentrate on your sister and not on your nerves.......There are two different ways to go with your speech. You can either be sentimental or funny..... To decide which is best, consider the bride and what she would likely prefer. It can depend on the tone of the wedding as well. Edit the templates using Adobe Reader. Fill your own information in with the details requested between the brackets to personalize the speech you select. A funny speech, like the one in the template to the right, is perfect if the bride has a great sense of humor and some cute quirks she wouldn't mind you sharing with everyone. For example, you could share a couple silly stories about how the bride likes cheese snacks dipped in dressing or that as a child, she tried to make toast in a VCR. The silliness continues as you share a couple impersonal dating tidbits and how you knew it was different with the groom. Pick this speech template if you know the bride wouldn't mind a few chuckles at her expense..........    This speech is written from the perspective of a sister who has a strong bond with the bride. The speech discusses their upbringing, recalls a childhood story or two, and talks about how growing up with this sister is entirely unique. The groom is casually mentioned and included as an integral part of the speech. His part in this speech is being welcomed to the family and the chaos you often go through.

It was the culmination of 4 years of hard work. The ceremony itself was pretty uneventful, with traditional student and guest speakers. I remember standing with my friends together for the last time in the tunnel for hours waiting for the ceremony to start. After the initial ceremony, we moved buildings to do proceedings for each individual college's graduation. It was pretty cool to see my friends walk across the stage. Another interesting thing is that I realized how many of the people in my college that I got to know over my four years. I recognized almost every name. I didn't go to the smallest school, so this was a pretty cool realization. Everyone's favorite teacher was reading out the names, so that made it a lot better, too. After the ceremony, my family and I were so tired from the day's events that we just wanted to go home. A lot of people went out to fancy restaurants to eat, but I just wanted to go to my favorite sandwich shop at home. After returning home, I took a much-needed nap. The day was exhausting but it's one of those things that you never forget. The biggest takeaway was reflecting on all of the relationships that I had made.",,3MB8LZR5BGFUSURVWZVQIV6N422LKJ,0.0,recalled

It’s the first engagement of all the cousins on my mom’s side — granted, there are only two cousins outside of myself, my brother and my sister. Still, it’s enough to be hot, hot family news and send us into a collective, year-long planning mode: How do we get to the wedding, what do we wear to the wedding, where do we stay for the wedding, what do we do before and after the wedding? The wedding becomes what we plan our lives around. It’s not that we’re crazy, wedding-obsessed people. It’s that my cousin’s wedding is in Shanghai, China. Both of my parents are from Shanghai. Most of my mom’s family is still in Shanghai, and my cousin who is getting married lives with my aunt and my uncle and my grandmother in the same house that my mother grew up in as a child. My family also lived in Shanghai for nearly two years when I was around 8 and 9 years old, and visited again a year later. But I had not been back since. And not only had I not been back, but in that 13-year separation, I had forgotten the bulk of Chinese I had ever known how to speak. Instead of focusing on re-learning the language in the year I had, I shoved it to the bottom of my mental to-do list. By the time December 2012 rolled around, I was no better at remembering how to say “Where is the bathroom?” than 12 months earlier. When we finally arrived in Shanghai, the reality of being in China’s largest city began to settle in. On the streets, taxis weaved in and out of lanes, miraculously avoiding crashes by near inches. People crowded the sidewalks, pushing others to get by and rushing across busy streets, also miraculously avoiding getting hit by cars. Buses honked. Street vendors hollered. We spent a day getting over the jet lag before the wedding. We saw my cousin and the rest of the family. We ate a lot of food in a short amount of time. And to be honest, by the morning of the wedding day, I wasn’t too worried about not being able to speak Chinese. My family had been assigned a big table together, and we could enjoy the w",,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQAD31HUGT,0.0,imagined

You can only live one life, unfortunately. Death, can sweep you away in an instant. Some people just let it happen, but others are just too stubborn to give up. I have a person in my life that has experienced this, along with myself. I experienced a traumatic experience. My mother was driving my friend, me, and my brothers to my dad’s house. My youngest brother, my friend, and I, were in the backseat and my eldest brother was in the passenger seat. My friend, my brother, and I were joking around and laughing in the backseat, when all of a sudden, the world went black. I opened my eyes moments later only to see my mother crying helplessly and weakly for help. I looked to my left, where my friend was, she was calling for her mother, saying “I want my mom, where is my mom?” and complaining that her shoulder hurt. I then looked to my right, and saw my little brother crying, and breathing harshly and saying “Mom wake up, Mom!!!” I, felt like crying but could not, I had to keep my brother and my friend, who are both two years younger than me, calm. My eldest brother, surprisingly was fine. He asked me if I was alright, and I responded by saying, my head hurts. My brother suddenly looked at the side of my face, and said “Jade put your gloves on your face.” I was wondering why so of course I did it but not that much of hurt i got. My brother was so scared and cried for our life . At that time a horse came there and jump over our car and surprised me because of this behave.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC0FGUK,,0.0,retold

Traffic was  heavy as usual downtown, yet fluid in movement. Students from the local university were outside drinking , partying, and taking in the sun. Then it happened ,I absently took my eyes off the road and car in the front of me for a second to look, to take in the scenery and when i looked back, the car in front of me had come to a quick stop. I slammed on the brakes, but it was not enough to prevent a car accident. Thankfully no one was hurt , numbers and dollars signs started running through the my heed, as typical for anyone who has been in an accident, but specially so for a wife of a personal finance blogger. So i like to share this information in this time because its the most valuable and memorable event of my life, as well its also an beautiful event  for my life. On that time i felt very bad about that suddenly looked car and shocked a second for avoiding that incident. But god's grace i won't make any damages to that car as well as a people who are all in that road. So that this incident made me to feel proud and teach me a lots of lessons through that single minute, the very worst drawback was i won't wear my seat belts too at that incident happenings, but if the accident happens and I definitely met with the greater injuries because of that worst event. The opposite driver was also a very good driver who has a lots and lots of experience in driving  because he easily control the vehicle in preventing the accident,the major accident was reduced because of that driver's anxiety and smartness. But now a days people won't have that much amount of smartness on the hardest situations, like this driving incident we should have a clear cut of ideas about what we are going to do, because we need a very much of talent in this controlling feelings. so I advice every one to follow the rules and regulations to find the happiness in their life, i recommend everyone to follow the rules after this incident because i experience the clear cut of accident. After that i advice everyone to stay constant and be brave on taking decisions as well as people was also started to believe in my words because of this incident. sometimes i admired those believe which gave to me by the people around me . As well I advice them to teach the traffic rules and create some awareness to the irrespective people like me to avoid the accidents. They also respect my words and started to create awareness among the irrespective and rural people to follow the rules and regulations, it will help their life to be strong and live the stress free life too.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC0FGUK,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC0FGUK,0.0,recalled

The white mountains hold a special place in our hearts and I have fond memories of going to the shops and restaurants there when we were out of college. My wife and I stayed at the the white mountain resort where we were able to finally have a break from our wonderful three children. We realized during our trip just how easy it is for us to get bogged down by the day to day reality of raising kids. It was a good event for us and I hope to do something similar every year from here on out. There is something about revisiting past locations that brings up emotion and memory. Two events stick out in my mind. One, on our first evening we went out to the Moat brew pub and had a great dinner. I have vivid memories of being out from college and eating the cheapest meals available. The other event that stuck out was the evening we spent on the deck of the resort having evening cocktails and just being together. I think when we do this again next year I would go back. The one thing I would change is our reliance on our phones. I think next year the rule will be that we turn them off and rely on our own two heads to get around. I want to have the time to get away from it all but I want to do it with her. A great memory!",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC2FGUO,,0.0,retold

Three months ago she and I decided to take a break from it all and booked a room at a hotel in the White Mountains of New Hampshire. To warrant the costs we treated it as an early anniversary gift to ourselves, as we were coming up on 10 years of being married. As my family is in another state, and her parents are no longer with us, we also booked our favorite babysitter to watch the three kids. The kids were ecstatic to learn that the babysitter was going to be watching them for two nights. We left once Lauren came and made our way to the White Mountains. It was a nostalgic trip up as we hadn't been in that area since before we were married. A lot had changed in the 10 plus years, more shops and everything looked new and expensive. The one exception was the restaurant that we had visited more times than we could count when we were fresh out of college and in that area, the Moat! We had dinner that night in the restaurant and walked through all that had changed since we were last there. We reflected on the hardships, where our life had turned in unforeseen ways and how little we were eventually prepared for all that had happened since. As we continued on throughout the weekend I reflected on how comfortable I had become with being next to my wife. Reflecting on the feeling I can only think of our relationship as a well worn tool that has seen the passage of hundreds of hours of time. Worn down a little, but smooth and comfortable. It sounds almost like a bad thing when I read it here but I also know that I find myself more and more in love with my wife the deeper into life we go.",3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC2FGUO,3MH9DQ757XYS9YI6FM2CBQADC2FGUO,0.0,recalled

It's a very well respected company and I know several people who have moved from my current company to the new one and loved it.  I've been hoping to get on there for a long time. I was feeling optimistic when I applied because this job is basically what I'm currently doing at my job so how could I not get it?! Little did I know when I applied how involved the application process would be. They don't do things like any other company I've interviewed with before. The first round of the interview is all video/audio and not in person at all. I had to answer questions while being recorded, because interviews aren't awkward enough. Most of the questions allowed multiple retakes but a few had limited retakes. The pressure was awful - if I messed up I was out of luck. After I finished the video ""interview,"" my confidence was shaken so I was very surprised to be called for another interview several weeks later. Still, this wasn't in person - it was via phone with the hiring manager. I was told the next step would be in person with the team but instead was asked to supply work samples. My confidence was back after the work samples as I was very proud of what I'd done. I kept anxiously checking my phone for a call on the next steps and was surprised when I got a call offering me the job! I figured there would be more rounds of interviews but I'm so glad there's not!",,3MHW492WW1ZSEN3SVFACKHWTJA7MVP,0.0,imagined

I became an aunt, actual blood related aunt. My brother and his wife gave birth to a baby boy the day after my late best friend's birthday. His birth on this date was very special to me because it was like he was a gift sent from heaven. It was almost like my best friend that had taken his life a few months ago had looked down on me, saw how sad I was, and decided that this beautiful little boy was exactly what I needed to help alleviate the relentless grief that I have been feeling. Little Ben was born a couple weeks early, and happy and healthy. He truly was a wonderful blessing to our family. I find it amusing that he has the same ears and blues eyes as my late best friend. Ben has only been in this world for two months and my life has already seemed to gotten better with him in it. I look forward to the new memories I will make with my new nephew. I am now happy that the future will be possible for new and happy memories to be made. It helps to take focus off of all the future memories that I lost when my friend died. Ben is the best thing to happen to my family. He is such a sweet and well behaved baby. I love that he was hand picked as my nephew.",3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4ALX43M6,3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4ALX43M6,0.0,recalled

There was a Toyota 4 Runner with a smashed front end in the passing lane and a Honda Civic that was just barely half the size it was before.  A leg was sticking out of the driver seat.  All traffic slowed and all of a sudden a lot of people got out of their cars and rushed over to the Honda Civic.  Everyone that looked inside the car immediately looked up and had a white look on their face, like they had seen a ghost.  I assumed everyone knew that the man inside was going to die.  I assume he was mechanically decapitated from the impact as he was parked and the 4-runner was travelling faster than the speed limit as it was.  I heard screaming from behind me, a woman appeared from out of the bushes.  She was stunned, the walking dead, but she appeared to be ok.  My wife had her sit down and just then a State Trooper arrived.  I told him to go to the car.  He was mad at me for directing him but he did so.  He looked in the car and stood up, his face white.

Much to my surprise at the annual meeting i was told that I would be getting the promotion. We have a small team with small goals and I had exceeded mine by the highest margin. This surprised me as I don't think I work particularly hard on work. Work just comes natural to me. I wont have many more increased responsibilities but now will be getting paid on a commission structure based on the work I do. This equates to nearly double the hourly salary I had before. I do feel as if i need to spend less time chit chatting throughout the day, but largely things have gone unchanged.

It was a beautiful wedding and we had been helping her plan it for months. The day had gone perfectly, so far. Everyone got together in the morning to get their hair and makeup done. My cousin looked gorgeous and everything was set to go. We were all having fun beforehand and drinking champagne. There was a lot of people in a tight space, so, I bumped into someone and spilled champagne entirely down my blush gown! I panicked and felt terrible. I was so scared that I ruined the dress and the day.  We called my Aunt to come in and she immediately had me take off the dress. She cleaned up the stain somehow. After that, she held the dress under a dryer. Miraculously, the stain came out and it dried in time. After that, we walked down the aisle and no one could tell! The wedding went on without a hitch. Everyone was so happy. It was great to see my cousin so happy. I enjoyed celebrating with her and had a great time.",3MYYFCXHJ4TTS0OR0GBUYMCJ2N44GN,,0.0,retold

I had always worked hard and alot of overtime. I never realised what I was doing to myself. I thought as long as I stayed active, I was doing my body good.

I met up with Elizabeth here in France of all places.  We grew up together in Chicago, and it's been eight years since I last saw her.  Despite that chasm of time between us, it's like we had just talked yesterday.  We still have so much in common, and I realized how much I missed her over these past few years.  She's just finished school and is engaged to be married. I told her all about Mike, and how we were planning our wedding. I think we talked for hours in the cafe today about our plans for our weddings.  She hasn't been back home to Chicago for 3 years, but plans to visit her family soon. So hopefully we can go visit some of our old haunts together when she gets back. I'm so happy to have reconnected with her.

Also i learn things i didn't even know were inside of me, they just come pouring out, effortlessly so to me writing is a wonderful release, allowing me to grow in awareness and peace. i think so i am a strong advocate of journal almost daily and find that is is amazing to go back and read what i have written because it gives a clearer reflection of how i felt about something a moth ago than i could  possibly muster now.  Our perceptions of our past emotions are always skewed by our current feelings.  That is what makes journalist so helpful. i somehow managed to get some space for myself.

I then got to hold my daughter for the first time.  I held her for almost hour.  During this time I talked to her about many different things.  I was over the moon.  As we moved to the maternity floor, my parents came in to meet her.  They cried and took many pictures of her.  We stayed in the hospital for another two nights.  During that time, they ran several texts on my wife and daughter to ensure that both were healthy.  Thankfully, everyone got a clean bill of health.

We got a dumpster and threw a buch of stuff away. The day that we moved it was the hottest day of the year!! We wanted to be able to have more time to do things together as a family. We are all very happy with the decision. It's beautiful here. There were a bunch of factors that went in to this move. My girlfriend was working a dead end job.

I have never been very good at it, however I am willing to attempt it.  This is a story about my family and I moving. A month and one week ago my family and I moved out of the state about 4.5 hours away.  We don't have any family in the area or know anyone here. It's something that we had been planning for quite some time.  We did a lot of research online and looked all over the country.  We made a budget to save a certain amount of money each week. After doing a lot of homework we figured out what would be enough money to cover all the moving costs and everything that goes with relocating 4.5 hours away.  We are living our dream and cannot be happier.  We are still saving money as we want to purchase our own land and build a house within the next year or so.  Some of the more memorable things about the move that I will never forget the rest of my life include but are not limited to it being the hottest most humid day of the year up until that point, and it hasn't reached those temperatures since and my friends and I had to load a 26' U-Haul while dripping sweat and complaining the whole time. We hooked up the truck to the trailer with the car on it at 9 PM and departed for our new home. About 5 minutes after we took off my girlfriend and I's favorite song came over the radio and we smiled and held each others hand as we continued on our journey. As I have said, it's something that we have been looking forward to for a long time, and we couldn't be happier thus far with our decision.",3N8OEVH1FSCLO6F77J3BHTRQJBIOOM,,0.0,recalled

She was suffering and the decision was a necessary one. She had been a wonderful companion and letting her go was difficult. At the vet she roused a bit and struggled to follow me. It was as if she knew what was coming. Afterward, there was more adjustment to my life than I had counted on. When I got home from the vet I had to round up and dispose of her things. This was a sad exercise. Each item recalled a specific moment and the reason for buying it. I had no trouble donating my parents excess possessions to charity when they passed. I found it unexpectedly difficult to do the same for my dog's things. They were my possessions really, but in my mind I attributed ownership to her. I had to cancel the automatic delivery of her dog food. The customer service rep took that as an opportunity to try and sell me things, which I didn't appreciate. I don't like to think of pets as possessions, but after a short period of mourning I decided it would not be disloyal to adopt another dog. I took my time and in early August brought home a female Basset hound puppy. She seems happy and the pet void in my life has been substantially filled. We are having a familiar yet unique set of experiences.",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SM1Z72U,,0.0,retold

Her name was Ginger. She was twelve and a half years old. This was a decision I had been dreading for weeks. For a basset hound, Ginger was usually rather spry. Around March of this year she began to spend most of her either in her bed or curled up next to me on the couch. I attributed her behavior to old age, and the vet agreed. He could find no illness or injury. Over the coming weeks she became progressively weaker until she was unable to walk. Her breathing was increasingly labored. I delayed the decision for as long as I could. On June 22, I carried her, bed and all, to the car and drove her to the vet.  He agreed that she would not recover and felt that ending her suffering was the correct decision. Throughout, Ginger was as alert and affectionate as ever. This made everything more difficult for me. I was certain that I was doing the right thing, but sometimes the right thing really sucks. Ginger was a playful, smart, and affectionate dog. She was a wonderful companion and definitely a member of the family. I will miss her greatly for a long time.",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SM1Z72U,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SM1Z72U,0.0,recalled

Our only child. In a shorter than expected time afterwards, my wife informed me that she was pregnant and just like that it was time to start preparing. We decided not to tell our family the gender until the baby was born. This turned out to be a nice thing for us to keep for ourselves, but was also hard to deal with prying family. Leading up to the birth of my daughter I wasn't very nervous until the month that she was due to arrive. It started to feel more real. I was going to become someone's dad. That's when it really hit me and the panic started to set in with all of the questions like: am I actually ready for this? Will I be a good dad? From the day my wife started labor and when my daughter was finally born was both the longest and shortest day of my life. It seemed like she would never come, but when she finally started to come everything became a blur and in no time she was born. From the moment I first held her all of those questions faded away and I was just in awe of her and amazed that I had become a father. It was the most amazing thing to happen to me in life so far and I wouldn't change it for anything. It's a cliche to say you felt an instant bond with your child, but I can attest that for me it was as real and cliche as it gets.",3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GDHJ8P4,,0.0,retold

It was one of the greatest days of my life so far. I wasn't prepared for the emotional impact that her birth would have on me. I am normally a fairly non emotional person, but that day I couldn't help it at all. I was surprised by the length of time it took for her to actually be born. I knew that it could take some time, but it was much longer than I had anticipated. My wife had to be induced and we were there for two and a half long days before she finally came. My wife originally didn't want to get an epidural, but quickly changed her mind once the labor pains really started piling in. The first time I got to hold my daughter after she was born, I felt instantly connected to her and my life felt more complete somehow. I feel like it also brought my wife and I closer together as we have shared such a majorly impactful event together. It was hard to watch her go through it all, but in the end it was more than worth and I don't think either of us would change a thing about it now. Our lives changed greatly that day and I'm not entirely sure that we were completely ready for the impact it would have on our everyday routines, but so far we have been able to adjust pretty well. We have become a good parenting team and our daughter is growing up so fast. I often think back on that day when she was born. It doesn't seem possible that it was so long ago already. She has changed so much in that time and is changing every day.",3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GDHJ8P4,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GDHJ8P4,0.0,recalled

I had not seen her since that day. I heard she had spent some time in Australia, working on a research vessel. About 4 months ago some ocean engineering student I know had built an Island in the middle of a lake they had created for a project. to inaugurate the island they were going to throw a party one afternoon. I was invited and I arrived at about 1 PM. the only way to get to that island was on a raft pulled along by a string above. while I was standing around nursing my beer, a darkly tanned blonde woman came up to me and asked me if I remembered her. I looked at her blankly for a moment.""Ph-ph-Phillipa?,"" I stammered. To make a long story short it was. But this was not the Phillipa that I remembered. The Phillipa that I remembered was pudgy, whiny, fat-armed, stoop-shouldered and forgettable.

My son knew I was watching the interaction, but didn't seem bothered by having me there. When I mentioned it later though, he did not want to talk about it.

So, my intention was to drop him off and come home and shower and get ready and pick up his aunt and uncle who had come from out of town. Well, the plan started out well and I got him ready and dropped him off at the venue. Just about that time, two  other nearby graduations were getting out and I was in gridlock. All of the stop lights were turned off and the police were directing pedestrian traffic. An hour later, I am no further than a half a mile where I dropped him off. I had no choice but to wait it out. I had to pick up his aunt and uncle. When I finally got out of the gridlock I just sped as fast as I could go! See, I never ever ever speed. I've being driving for 40 years without a single ticket. I was in a complete panic that there would be no time to get back. I zipped home in no time.

I was such a proud mom! As a single mother, I have had it a bit rough. There were times I felt I didn't have enough time for my son, so this day was very meaningful as he was graduating with honors and a full scholarship. The day started with rushing out the door to get my son to the rehearsal. I was to go back home and pick up my sister and her husband and return to the arena. Well, as it turned out there were 2 other HS graduations happening the same day in Downtown Orlando. I dropped my son off several blocks away because I could not get close to the front door and then tried to navigate back home. I was stuck in traffic for what seemed an eternity! I was in a full blown panic because I realized time was running out to pick up my sister and her husband and get back to the graduation. I could turn around and go back to the arena, but then my sister and brother in law would miss the ceremony. I decided that was a bad idea because they had flown in from Texas for the event. So, for the first time in my life I sped. And I mean I was really speeding. I pulled up, jumped out and put on a dress in 2 minutes flat. And we were off. Late, but off.

In the other words, is going beyond what the person expects from you. Also, is thinking deeper than usual so everything can go as I plan.

Out the corner of my eye I saw someone vaguely familiar but just kind of dismissed it. As I rounded the aisles I saw him again, but a bit clearer. I was almost sure it was a friend I hadn't seen in over a decade. The last time we saw each other was in my hometown, and we hadn't spoken in many years. As I got a bit closer I could see it was him, so I called out his name. He looked up and immediately recognized me. Straight away he walked towards me for a hug and asked how I was. It was so weird - he'd moved here a few years before and me only a few weeks before, and he worked nights. Normally he was still at work at this time, so it was even stranger for us to bump into each other. We briefly caught up and then went our separate ways.

I checked literally 3 times that my eyes didn't deceive me, but there my friend was. At 6:30 in the morning, in the same gas station, several towns over from where we both grew up. I was blown away. I walked all the way up to him before I said anything because I just couldn't believe it was happened. As soon as I said something he looked right up and recognized me, and straight away we started talking and catching up. He hadn't been in town longer either - maybe a year - so we were both kind of dumbfounded to see each other at all, nevermind in such a random place at a random time. We exchanged numbers and it turned out he'd tried to find me a few times over the years too. We've both gotten married and he has a few kids. We still haven't actually caught up in person over a beer but we will do soon.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6PZ4970,,0.0,recalled

There are all different types of diaries, like food diaries, health diaries or academic diaries. But your diary doesn’t have to be specific if you don’t want it to be, it can also just be a place where you write about whatever you want. If you’re just getting started, maybe you haven’t decided what you want to write about, and that’s fine. That is what we are here for – to help you with all those moments of writer’s block you may be having. Our tips can help guide you and inspire you. Let’s begin! How to Start a DiaryTo start a diary, all you need is a willingness to write. Start by figuring out what you want to write in your journal. If you aren’t sure, simply start writing and see where that leads. It can also be useful to set a time limit in your early writing sessions. Set an alarm for 10 to 20 minutes and start writing. Keeping a diary is a great way to record your growth and personal development. More entries will allow you to look back and see what has changed over time. The earlier you start, the more grateful you will be later on. There's no time like the present - start your free online journal today! 8 Tips When Starting a DiaryWriting can be hard and getting started is usually the hardest part. If you feel like you don’t know how to write a diary entry, don’t stress over it. You can start writing about anything but. You can even write about how you can’t think of anything to write. Once you start getting words out some, they will start to flow naturally. 1. Decide to writeFirst, you need to decide you want to start a diary. Once you have decided you want to dedicate time to creating a diary, starting one will be easy. 2. Decide what to writeThis is definitely the hardest part when writing a diary, but it is used probably",,3O6CYIULEENO6K86UR6UXTW1FJ2WUV,0.0,recalled

In January, I decided that I had been sober for long enough and was mature and responsible enough now that I could have a drink every once in a while in social situations. It all started with a beer commercial. I was watching everyone relax with a drink and they seemed so happy and carefree. I am a mother of five with a high stress full time job. I loved the thought of coming home and relaxing with a glass of wine. I went to the store and bought a small bottle. I had a few glasses and it was lovely. I didn't drink again for several days but when Friday came around, I bought another small bottle. I followed this pattern of drinking twice a week for about a month but things got worse really fast. Within a couple months, I was drinking daily. I started drinking so much that I would get the shakes during the day until I got home and could have a drink. It got to the point where I really wanted to stop, but I physically couldn't. Once I realized that I couldn't stop on my own, I reached out to my family and the owners of the Company I work for. After getting honest with everyone including myself, I decided to check myself into a detox center. It took me three tries to find one that would take me due to the fact that most detox centers are for low income people without medical insurance. For once, having medical insurance was actually a bad thing. Eventually, I found a treatment center that would work with me. I checked myself in immediately and stayed for 4 days.

In the months prior to Kisses' passing I noticed she had become lethargic and wasn't her usual spunky self. She'd lost interest in playing. She stopped hanging out on her usual perches. Eventually stopped jumping on to the couch and even on to my bed. I was worried. Then, I began to notice her breathing become labored and wheezy. I made an appointment to have her checked out by her long time veterinarian and expected that he would give Kisses some antibiotics and tell me she'd be fine in no time. But, that's not what happened and I had my heartbroken to learn Kisses had lung cancer. The treatment she would have needed to survive was more than I could afford and I felt like I had failed her. I couldn't let her suffer. Watching Kisses struggle and not enjoy the things she used to was crushing and I knew it was because I couldn't afford to help her. At that point it felt cruel and selfish make her keep living in this condition, so I took her back to the vet and had her put down. I regretted it instantly. I wished I could take it back. I killed my cat before the lung cancer could.",,3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7L5EEOA2,0.0,imagined

I had worked with the boy's mother many years ago. I met her when she was a new employee and new to this country. She was a Lebanese immigrant who came to this country to marry a Lebanese man from her village. They made their home in America and were very hard workers. I helped her assimilate to this country, assisting with drivers license and insurance paperwork. I was there for the birth of her three sons. They had no family in the US. As a co-worker I became a part of their family through our long relationship. The third boy was born on my birthday and we often shared a birthday celebration together. Their father got Alzheimer's and the three boys all worked jobs, studied hard in school, and spent long hours at home helping their mother care for their father at home. The father died about a year ago. This past Spring the third son graduated from College. He wanted me and my husband to be there. It was a celebratory time because he had been accepted into Medical School-but also sad because the father had passed and was not there. He would have been so proud. The boy was like a son to me and I was so proud of him and proud to be asked to share the special occasion. His was the immigrant success story. They have worked so hard and been so caring -I am saddened by the negative attitudes some folks have against immigrants. The most memorable part of the day was shortly after he received his diploma we were dismissed and were looking for him in the crowd. His two older brothers were the first to find him. They both ran to him and wrapped him in a big brotherly bear hug that lifted him off the ground.",3OHYZ19UGDRWM2L6X0YTGY7LWKUAO7,,0.0,retold

I spent a lot of time helping her with things like signing up for insurance, taxes, and getting a driver's license. She was very grateful and we remained close friends through the years.

The boy's father had early onset Alzheimer's disease and was in the terminal stages of the disease. The father was kept at home and was lovingly cared for by his sons and their mother.  In addition for caring for his father, the boy was always working to earn money for his college bills. In his Junior year confided in us his desire to go to Medical School. He did get accepted into Med School. When it came time for graduation, he told his mom that he wanted to invite me and my husband to attend his graduation. It was very touching to see him walk across the stage and accept his diploma. I felt sad because I knew his father and was sad that he could not be there to see his son accept his degree that day. He would have been so happy and proud. After the event his two brothers were the first to see him. They both took off running and simultaneously tackled him into a great bear hug of brotherly love.

I didn't see it coming and was totally caught off guard. He planned a trip for us to go to the beach. We hadn't been on a vacation in what seemed like forever and it was our one trip to finally get away. We geared up to head out and made our way to the west coast. Though I had never been, we always talked of getting there someday. We found our way to our hotel room and unpacked our stuff. After settling in, we decided it was time for the beach. At that point, it was sunset and he wanted to go out for a sunset walk along the water. So we did. It was surprisingly pretty empty on the beach. As we were walking, before I knew it, he bent down. At first I thought he had found something or had hurt himself somehow, but then he looked at me and pulled out the ring. I was ecstatic and overjoyed. I cried my eyes out. I will never forget that day and how much I love that man.",,3OLQQLKKNTBLB4BLXS8A4LGQI4NJEV,0.0,recalled

We ended up visiting some caves when we were down there, and seeing much of the town that we were in.  The actual wedding was pretty fun.  It was very high class in attire since it was at the Green Briar, but I didn't mind too much. They had really good food, and the music was decent since it was a live band.  Of course, we definitely took advantage of the open bar - haha!  Then, the drive home was pretty average.  It was just like the drive down.  It was long, but it is what it is.

I had booked as to do a Star Wars VR experience. It was so much fun and for the first time in a long time I was able to forget about the stressors at home and just relax and have fun as a couple. Then we went to lunch and had a few drinks. It amazing how fast you can reconnect when there are no outside forces to pull you out of the moment. That night we had a romantic dinner atop a restaurant overlooking the fireworks. It was like after one day we had rekindled what we had lost just by being able to shut out the outside world. It was the prefect way to start out vacation. It was like we were finally back to our old selves. We had let little things get in our way, but with those things far away back home, we could just focus on each other. I went to bed on cloud nine.

We were all headed up to the new building our company opened up to make sure that we had everything we needed for contractors, power, and other needs.  It was not a bad day weather wise.  It was slightly cooler than normal, but overall a nice day.  The traffic wasn't too bad either.  Heading into Boston during a work day can be frustrating with all the traffic you have to deal with.  We were probably about a half an hour from our destination.  I was sitting behind the driver, my boss was to the right of me and there was another co-worker in the passenger seat.   All of a sudden I heard my co-worker whom was driving say, 'oh crap!', and I looked forward and saw a box truck slam on its break.  Then like a bullet I saw a Fed-ex truck swerve.  From there it went right to left and went head on into a guard rail.  Time seemed to slow at this time, almost like in a movie.  The fed-ex truck's back end came inward and the truck began to flip over the rail.  It was all so surreal.  The traffic stopped and we saw the drive unclip his belt and hit the roof of the truck from within.  At that point we felt that he was good to go and other passer bys stopped by to help him.  I did see the story about it that evening and the highway was shut down for some time and no one was injured.

My son loves all animals but was specifically excited to see the lions.  We got lucky.  The lion was a huge male with a big mane.  He was up and walking around which is something we don't often get to see.  He even gave us a couple of roars which was thrilling for my son but scared my 1 year old daughter quite a bit.  We had a picnic in the middle of the zoo and then my son got to ride the carousel.  We continued our day at the zoo and got to see many of my son's favorite animals. After the zoo we headed home, grilled some burgers and hot dogs, and had cake and ice cream.   We then got to let me son open presents.  He was thrilled to see that he had got many of the animals he had seen at the zoo in one of his gifts.  He was also excited for the Nerf Gun and bubbles he opened.  My son got up the next morning and asked if he could have another birthday!",3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7OWA3634,3OXV7EAXLFC6DBGHOPXPCQ7OWA3634,0.0,recalled

At first we really didn't think we needed to be worried and then with every passing hour, things got more intense. So, I had to wake up early and get my kids dressed and ready. I had to take a ride sharing car to the grocery store and i had to go in along side all of the zombies trying to find food to last should the hurricane hit and we lose power. It was awful because the store was packed, the lines were long and there was no water left. There was hardly anything substanial at that point. After that, I went to the liqour store to buy some rum. The hurricane did not end up hitting us at all. It was a fluke and every one was panic and filling gas and spending money and we did not get hit. I am so grateful that we did not get hit but i am also so over whelmed thinking about the ordeal that was. Now, i still have food that remains from that weekend. Still in the cabinets, untouched. It was better to be safe than sorry and be prepared just in case. It was better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have.

I was on edge like running around like a chicken with my head cut off. I was so panicked and worried about this hurricane hitting us head on as a Cat 5. I could not find water anywhere or much of anything that would be needed. I could not find batteries for  our flashlights. It was pretty intense, I did my best. I spent so much money on things, basically the last of what I had went to hurricane supplies, only to realize that the hurricane was not even going to hit is at all. We were in an induced panic by the media for nothing to come out of it. Its like my feelings were literally played with in the worst way. It is okay though at least we stocked up on a lot of snacks. I have plenty to stress munch on. It is far better to be safe than to be unprepared and sorry and in a huge hole. We ended up getting very lucky that the hurricane turned the other way and the panic was temporary, that our family and homes are safe. This was a very eye opening experience being the adult and mother in the situation for the first time. I use to be the kid that was oblivious and my parents went through all the trouble of figuring out what it was they should do or should not do to keep us safe and prepared. I guess now it is my turn to have to deal with all the decisions and pray that it is the right one.",3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWQWJOLT,3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWQWJOLT,0.0,recalled

There had been fires in the area near the freeway that had stopped traffic and we wanted to make sure we got on the plane for the first leg of our trip to Los Angeles.  So the next day we got on the plane and made it to Los Angeles.  We stayed overnight there in the Crowne Plaza hotel right near the airport also.  Our flight to French Polynesia was and unusual one in that it took off in the afternoon and got to Papeete  at about 9 pm at night.  We got on the plane for the long flight.  We got there and were met at the airport by a group that our Tahiti Legends had on the ground to take us to our overnight stay in the island of Tahiti until the next day when we would get on the ferry to go to Moorea.  Papeete was a typical city atmosphere which we really didn't like that much.  I knew that from when I went there 27 years ago.  So we really didn't consider our vacation had started until we got to Moorea.  The next day we got to Moorea on the ferry and began to see the beauty of what I had experienced 27 years ago.  When we got to the Moorea dock, we were picked up for our ride to our hotel with an over water bungalow.  The ride was kind of sad because I remembered Moorea from 27 years ago and it had been built up and was more crowded, which was to be expected. Not as nice as 27 years ago.  We made it to our hotel and were escorted to our bungalow.  Now our vacation had started. It was a beautiful place to stay with the view over the water.

I finally decided to cash in some stock that I had and set up the trip for our 25 wedding anniversary.  I thought about it and chose the islands that I thought my wife would enjoy.  And I had one special island for me.  On Rangiroa 27 years ago I took many pictures of the black tip reef sharks, a very few with mine and many more with another person's camera.  I only had one that came out ok.  So I wanted my shark pictures.  We went to the airport early and took our first plane to Los Angeles and got on an afternoon flight to Papeete.  Our first island stop was Moorea, where we spent 7 days in an over water bungalow.  The Moorea of today saddened me because 27 years ago it was pristine and uncrowded.  Not now.  Next we went to Huahine, where we found the French Polynesia of 27 years ago.  Few cars and few people and absolutely beautiful.  I actually stayed in the same hotel that I had stayed in 27 years ago.  We had a great time there and rented a car to drive around the island. Bora Bora was our next stop and it was pretty much the same as it was 27 years ago.  It looks really nice flying in, but not so much on the ground.  We had decided not to get an over water bungalow there because it was too expensive.  But when we got there, we were moved into an over water bungalow at no additional charge.  We left after 3 days to my ultimate destination, Rangiroa.  We were staying a very nice hotel with our beach bungalow facing out to the crystal clear blue water.   Then on Sunday we went out to the Blue Lagoon where not only did I get shark pictures, I got shark videos.  I had tears in my eyes on the ride out because after 27 years I was finally going to get my shark pictures.  It was a rough ride, but we got to the blue lagoon and I was overjoyed. This was the trip of a lifetime and I only hope we can make it back one more time before we get too old.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,0.0,recalled

This was special for me as a single mother. The housing market was tight and we were having a tough time getting an offer accepted. The house I purchased seemed perfect so I took a chance and put in an offer that waived an inspection. My offer was accepted. I was nervous signing for such a large obligation with just my income, but I had worked hard to get in a comfortable financial position. We even moved in with my parents for a few months to save up even more money for a house. On move-in day we found out the air conditioning was broken. I was feeling pretty stupid for not getting an inspection. I was crying and feeling so awful during what should have been a joyful time. I called for service and it took 2 days for them to come.

The bank didn't do its job correctly.  They approved the buyer for a loan, and only after going through a month of negotiations did they look into their employment.

I was still optimistic about selling, but I was getting a little worried. Eventually, foreclosure procedures were started on the property.  I also had to pay utilities and other various taxes and bills.  It was a drain on my money, and reached the point where I was going to be losing money on the sale.  I was still willing to do it, because I wanted to avoid foreclosure. I finally got an offer on the house.  It was just enough that I would be able to afford the payoff I had gotten the month before.  I had to request a new payoff, and came to find that it had jumped $5000 since the last time, because of lawyers fees and escrow advancement. Because of this, at just the moment someone put in a good offer on the house, and I'd be able to sell and avoid foreclosure, the payoff amount jumped far beyond my means.  This left me with no other option than to wait for a foreclosure, and take the hit to my credit.

I had just moved over from the Intake agent side of the call center, and was still only about six month into my tenure with the company. I was really looking forward to something new and fresh, and to stop having to answer phone calls all day. I was in charge of the really basic stuff in Workforce since I was the new guy. The boring things that no one else wanted to do and could just pawn off because it was so mind numbing. That's what I got. It wasn't fun. It wasn't glamorous, but it was still better than phone calls. My, I think, second week into the new position I was starting to get bored by it too. It was really easy stuff, so I started doing other things while doing my work to keep my mind engaged. I started writing a really simple VBA code to automate some of the work. One code lead to another, to another, to another and after about a week 99% of my job was automated, which gave me more time. With this time I started really looking at the stuff I had been tasked with sorting and noticed that it was wrong. The data points didn't match up and it didn't fit with what common sense said the final results should be. So I started looking deeper, and found not one or two but about 10 different flaws from the previous people who did this work. So I started fixing it, and after about a week it was done, the data was clean and things started matching up. So I took it to my boss, let him know what I found, where the problem was, and what I had done to fix it. He was first confused at how I had the time to do it, which is when I let him know I wrote the codes to do the grunt work for me. Then he asked me to do the same thing for a different set of reports. I came back a couple of hours late with the results. More errors, and how to fix them. Right there, on the spot he promoted me to Workforce Data Analyst. I was shocked, less than four weeks in and I was in a team lead level roll just because I found some problems.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHETT2X,0.0,imagined

All of sudden i saw a tail from underneath a car , I told my son to help me see what that was , he told me not to move and he went to look for whatver it was moving. I was so nervous because I was so sure it was an animal and it was probably hurt so I felt scared and sad at the same time. I heard my son saying something I couldnt understand followed by the winning of this tiny little white thing , it was the most beautiful thing , a tiny white ball of fur. I felt so in love and scared for him , it was a boy. my son and I took him to the vet and after he got all the shots and a full check up and we were told that he was in perfect shape we decided to took him with us to our home. we made the decission to call him Max it sounded powerful but with a lot of character just like i think his personality is. he ate so much the first 3 days it seemed like he wasnt eating much the time he spent at the streets. After 2 days we got a phonecall from the vet , they told us that they found the brother of the dog we found , we couldnt believe it , so now we didnt know what to do. We had a long conversation about separation and what damage that could do to anyone and that includes pets , so we decided to adopt the brother as well . We now live in a house with 2 lovely dogs. we instead walking alone we walk with both of them , they are so protective of us, and like to play a lot, we are so blessed we got the posibilities of taking care of them.",3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHGX2TE,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAHGX2TE,0.0,recalled

She has been my friend since we were four years old, so this wedding meant a lot to me. First, I got to meet a lot of her family and friends that I had never met before. I live six hours from her now so it was wonderful to catch up with her. We spent the first night eating dinner together and we had the best time. I loved getting to know her friends and her fiance better. The next day we spent most of the day getting ready for the wedding. We went and got our nails done. We went to lunch together. We went to the church and began setting up for the wedding. The day of the wedding we went to the church early so that we could get ready and relax as well. We had so much fun watching each other get our hair and makeup done. When it was time for the actual wedding we got a lot of great pictures. We told a lot of jokes to try to keep our nerves calm! The actual wedding was beautiful. Everything went smoothly and not one thing went wrong. After the wedding we had a beautiful reception with great food, a picture booth, and lots of great friends getting to chat. It was one of the best events I have been to in a long time.

She had not been doing well for several months, and due to the nursing home's neglect, she had contracted sepsis. Sepsis is basically an infection to your blood that is very toxic and dangerous for the elderly. I was extremely upset to hear this. I was angry and confused, as well as scared. How could this happen? I live in Illinois and my grandma lived in Florida. At the time, I did not have a good enough job to be able to afford a trip down to Florida. I felt absolutely broken about this, as I had not seen her in years and knew that I would not be able to see my grandmother ever again. Fortunately my mom was able to afford the trip down there to be with my grandmother as she passed on. I wish I could have been there for my mother as sh went through that as well. We had hope at first that strong antibiotics would knock the infection out of her system, but old age was working against her and the drugs were not working at all. She passed away peacefully in hospice care surrounded by her family, which is exactly what her wishes were. I know she did not suffer. She did not feel any pain due to the miracle of modern medicine.  I still feel terrible that I was not able to be with her, but I also know that she knew I loved her and that we will see each other again someday. I find peace knowing she is in heaven with my grandpa!",3PEIJLRY6UFGNO21ZWHHH0V5Z4VXWW,,0.0,retold

As a part of the story there was one event that stood out. In the middle of the surgery when the baby was delivered, that tense and overwhelming moment, the doctor looked at me and asked where the camera is so I can take her first picture. I was so lost and in a hurry to get in the surgery room that I have completely forgot to bring the camera with me. I was so happy, a feeling that I have never experienced before, it felt like I was a new person, a new me. I remember calling my family, my parents and brothers letting them know that my daughter was born. I was very excited and proud when I gave them the news. Another exciting moment was when we all got finally home. From that moment I knew that all our focus has shifted on her. Everything is about her now, cuddling, feeding, bathing and even doctor visits for shots. We both learned to cherish every moment we're spending with her.

She was very well taken care of and assured that everything will be alright at the end. After the two long weeks waiting the team of doctors decided that she will have to be induced into labor and will have a Cesarean section. I was totally taken by surprise, they gave that gown to put on and everyone rushed into the surgery room. Then was when I was the most nervous because I felt the need for urgency, I was quickly calmed down, we were not running to the room but the whole team was gathered and did not wanted to have anyone waiting. I was told that there was a set time when the surgery starts. Inside the surgery room was a different story, I felt like I was in a spaceship, everything sterile, I could not detect any faces, they were all covered with surgical masks, including mine. The whole surgery lasted about 45 minutes and everything turned out perfect. The great moment was then and there, I had tears in my eye. The doctor that made the delivery looked at me and asked me if I want to take a picture, her first picture. I did not even take the camera with me in that rush but after 4 months the picture still lays in my mind unchanged. I can say that it changed my life forever. As we got home a new chapter started and I felt the happiest I could have been.",3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIDZ6JJ3,3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIDZ6JJ3,0.0,recalled

My sister lives in Boston, I live in Rhode Island, and we're originally from Connecticut. However, we don't usually meet up with each other unless it's a special occasion. So for this past Mother's day in April, we all planned a surprise for my Mother's birthday in a fancy Italian restaurant in Boston. I remember a bit of skepticism since we didn't even spend Christmas together, but everyone wanted to make this happen. So we started planning and everyone carved out a chunk of time for the occasion. On mother's day we met up in Boston and actually had a really good time. I think the fact that we were all able to take time out was the most surprising and I think everyone really enjoyed being around the family. We ordered some expensive wine and had some expensive dishes and we indulged. We talked about a variety of subjects from dieting to work to random nonsense. It was a very relaxing time. Afterwards, we shopped around the Italian marketplace since my mother and I love to cook.  We found some cool ingredients and got some chocolate. My sister made me pick up the bill. We then went for a walk around the city before heading back. My sister had to leave first since she had to catch up on some work, but I still enjoyed the time nonetheless.",3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIF7LJJ0,,0.0,retold

They live a bit farther away, as do I, but my sister lives in Boston. Now, we are not a tight-knit family. We are usually pretty independent and like doing our own thing. However, we like to make time to get together for special occasions like this. Since my mother's birthday is also close to Mother's day in general, we decided to have a nice lunch in a relatively fancy Italian restaurant and market in Boston. We met up during Sunday afternoon. I had to run some errands and my sister was doing her own work related tasks. Now, this was the first time we had all been in the same area since the holidays, so it had been well over five months. We are not that sentimental as a family, but I could tell that my parents were really happy that we both could make it. We didn't really discuss too many emotional things, instead we strayed towards things like relatives, job talk, and diet talk. However, it never got contentious and everyone seemed like they were having a good time. I think the most memorable part of the event was just going shopping afterwords with my Mom to pick out different pastas and chocolate. I've gotten into cooking more in the past year, so I think my Mom was happy to discuss different ingredients with me. Overall, I had a good time, and it was a productive use of my day. Even though I can get self-centered, and wrapped in my own head, sometimes I do have to just step back and appreciate the things I have like my family.",3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIF7LJJ0,3PIWWX1FJKSTMKXDBTJ111TIF7LJJ0,0.0,recalled

Indy had problems with her eyesight she couldn't tell what was what when it was far away. She ones saw a woman pulling a suitcase and thought it was a dog or animal on a leash. She barked and went crazy over seeing a suitcase being pulled along the street. Our family always laughs about that. She also saw a huge painting of a man on the wall of a store in town. She thought he was real and barked and barked. Her hair was raised up on her back and she didn't stop till we drove away. Indy was part Lab and part german shorthair. She had a short tail that had been cropped by who ever had her as a puppy. She was a rescue dog. We buried our beloved Indy in the backyard in the garden. She spent a lot of time out there with me. I planted wildflowers over her grave. We placed a big rock with her name printed on it to mark her grave. I still talk to her when I am in the garden.

We had decided to go shopping and get out of the house since she had just gotten cheated on by her ex. I wanted to get her to take her mind off him anyway, but we both needed a new dress as well. It was a perfect excuse! We went to the mall and went into some of the store. She really didn't see anything she liked for a wedding. I told her it probably was because she wasn't in the mood for love type things right now. My friend said that right now she's not even thinking about spending  money on someone's wedding, she just hated the idea of love. Someone walking by heard us talking and stopped us and told us that we shouldn't lose hope on love. My friend told her that she was just cheated on by her long time boyfriend and for right now men are scum. I started laughing and told the woman to ignore her, she's upset. The woman told us it was understandable, but to not take his actions out on all men. She made a good point about our friend's marriage and how she must have found a great man that wouldn't cheat if she's willing to celebrate her love with everyone else. I was like ""She's got a point!"" My friend said, ""Ok, ok! You got me! We'll go and look for a dress now and I'll be a little less bitter about men...tomorrow!"" and we all laughed and the woman said to go to the dress shop down near Macy's. She said they had great dresses and they were reasonably priced and if we didn't mind dresses that had been worn before, they had great cheap dresses and the owner would probably give us a deal if we liked something but it was out of our price range. I was like ""I don't mind preowned, most of my shopping is thrifted anyway."" So we go to the dress place, it has so many good dresses and we tried on and liked so many of them. We were helped by the clerk and decided on 3 dresses we loved each and since the prices were great, we were getting all 3 of them. I joked with the clerk that we were told the manager would cut us a deal because some random woman told us about this place. The clerk called to the back and asked if she could give us a deal and the stranger that talked to us came out and said ""Yea, you should cut them a deal. Ring up the cheapest dress and ring them up for that one and let them have the other dresses for free."" I was shocked but thankful!

After what seemed like forever but was really only a short period, my cat Stubbs has passed on. I had known that he was sick but had been giving him medicine to treat his kidney issues for a while and he had seemed stable. Then in the lead up to this, he stopped eating or drinking, had trouble even walking, and had a dull glassy look in his eyes. I took him to the vet in a panic whereupon he informed me that Stubbs red blood cell count was dangerously low and his kidneys had degraded even further. After spending a week under observation there being given fluids and medicine I was allowed to take him home, under orders to inject a saline solution into him every day which he understandably was not overly happy about (and the scars from the scratches and bites on my arms can attest to that), but it seemed to be working for several months. Then he just abruptly degraded again do it was back to the vet, they did the usual treatment and observation before letting me bring him home, but this time was different and I think we all knew it, but no one wanted to say that I was just taking him home so he could die in a place of comfort rather than a cage surrounded by people he didn't know. He was fine for a short while upon coming home seeming to have one last gasp of energy where he was friendly and playful, but the other cats could sense something was off and kept their distance.  All too soon he found himself unable to even stand and was forced to drag himself around the room on his side, even picking him up caused him to yowl in pain. The end was upon us that night, there was a loud screech from him in the middle of the night and by the time I had gotten out of bed and over to him he was already dead. It was heartbreaking to witness it, but at the least it wasn't drawn out forever with him in pain, and when the worst of it came he passed fairly quickly. Both I and my remaining cats were in a malaise for days, as they could tell he wasn't coming back this time. I had him cremated and then buried wrapped in his favorite blanket that he'd drag around everywhere. It was hard on me but I'm happy I was able to give an older (15) cat a new home to enjoy his remaining days rather than languishing at a shelter. It's going to make it all the harder to go through this another three times as my other cats get on in years though and I'm coming to dread every ailment that they suffer out of fear of it being the prelude to this happening again.",,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6197J89G,0.0,recalled

We wanted to be sure that our sons had a great time. We saved money and rented a nice house. We drove about 5 hours to get there. We checked in and decided to take a quick nap and then head to the pool. We had a ball. Next was baths and dinner. We used Yelp to help us decide what to eat. Dinner was nice. the  next day we went to the beach. the beach was beautiful. my sons had fun buiding sand castles and splashing in the water. We got home and relaxed. We headed to a nice restuart. The food was great. Bed and baths was just what we needed after a long day. After a few days we loaded the car and hit the road. But not before one last visit to the water park! The drive home was peaceful. We unloaded and unpacked and returned back to normal life.,3PMBY0YE28PH8UEYFPB2P32KZY49CN,,0.0,retold

We planned in advance and saved enough money to enjoy our vacation. The drive from Atlanta to the Myrtle beach was about five and a half hours. The kids played games and took naps. We stopped twice for potty breaks and snacks. We enjoyed the senic route and listened to music. My favorite game was I spy. Once we arrived at the hotel the kids took a short tour and changed into their swim trunks. It is tradition to let my husband rest after his drive while I let the kids swim to burn off any built up energy. Once at the pool the real fun began. They splashed and played and met new friends. Time to go and dry off for dinner I announced. We decided to have pizza for dinner. Quick and easy.

Not all of them, but with 40 kids and half with behavior issues, it's hard to keep them safe. I sat down and checked my phone. I saw a message from my partner that said  our friend had died. I knew it was coming, but it was still hard. I had hoped maybe things would turn around and get better. I don't really remember what happened for the next couple of minutes. I know I sat down and was just lost in my own thoughts and grief.  I expected the kids to just take advantage of this and get even more out of control. That's not what happened. Instead the students were very nice. They went and found someone who could cover the class, so I could leave the room for a few minutes.

I went to go see him when he was just a few weeks old. It was surreal holding him in my hands, hearing him breathe and yawning, showing his toothless gums. While holding him, it made me think about how we are so similar at the beginning and ends of our life. Children, and the elderly, need lots of support and care, to be surrounded by loved ones. I began to think that one day, I was this little bundle of joy for my own parents, and one day I would have a child with my wife as well. Thoughts about childcare, diapers and bottles all filled my mind, and I questioned if I was ready for such an endeavor. My wife also had a chance to hold him and thought he was the cutest thing. Soon after, the baby would not stop crying, no matter what his parents did to soothe him. I also wondered if I was such a child for my parents, and whether I would have to deal with this in the future as well. It was great seeing the entire family altogether in one place, as it doesn't happen very often. I pondered what kind of role I would play in my nephew's future, if I would be very involved or just a distant relative he would see during the holidays. My brother and I are not very close, but obviously for events like this we would have to be present. Regardless, I'm not sure if this child is enough to bring our relationship any closer. Seeing new life is one of the biggest encouragements to make someone reflect on their own life, and what is most important to them.",3PPTZCWALR608M6UO56WMWTUK5TQZ4,,0.0,retold

He was so small, yet he was quite large for babies at 2 weeks old. This was the first time that I had held a baby that was related to me, that was my family. He looked so peaceful, and when he got a little fussy, it was so strange to see his gums as he opened his mouth. It reminded me that the beginning of our lives and end of our lives are quite similar. We barely have any teeth, we are weak, and need our loved ones to take care of us. I wondered what kind of personality my nephew would have, despite him not showing much at all. Would he be like his father, my brother, who is kind at heart but not the most mature in many other ways? Or would he be like his mother, who is quite the diva? My question was soon answered as he went to get fed, but suddenly became inconsolable. He simply would not stop crying, unless someone held him. The moment he was laid down in his crib, he would burst out, wailing again. This continued for almost an hour before his parents decided to take him for a walk. I began to see that this is what my parents did for my brother and I, yet they had significantly less resources than us. It made me appreciate that they balanced their work and taking care of us - all the sacrifices we didn't see, we couldn't possibly fathom, until now.

My mother rarely texts me, so I knew something was up. My birthday was next weekend and I had planned with my partner to have a quiet day. But this morning he was acting strangely. He acted like he had some kind of secret that he was dying to tell me but and was struggling to restrain himself. He's never been good at keeping a secret. After receiving so many out of the ordinary texts, I suspected maybe I was in for a surprise party. While I do love a good surprise, I don't want to look a mess. I can look quite the fright after a day at work. My mother, who is in many ways my twin, realizes this, which is probably why she texted me. She didn't reveal anything specific but by simply texting me, I knew something was up. I decided to cut out of work a bit early and hit Nordstrom's before I went home. If there really were a bunch of people at my house waiting to yell ""Surprise!"" at me, I wanted to look good. I found a cute dress which I wore out of the store. I reapplied my makeup while in the parking lot. When I opened the door to my house at least 30 people jumped out at me. Balloons were releases and party horns were blown. My mother came up and gave me a hug. ""New dress huh?"" she asked smiling at me. ""Yep"" I replied, ""thanks for the heads up."" She smiled knowingly at me and handed me a glass of champagne. I love surprises but I also like to be prepared for them.",,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIMO2IIP,0.0,imagined

I knew what was coming but still tried to act surprised as everyone greeted me. I very clearly remember everyone's faces at that instant as they welcomed me to the party. Overall, my friend Steve helped quite a bit in organizing the party. Aside from my family, my childhood friends Raymond and Wei was also there at the party. We had some drinks, snacks and a very delicious fruit cake. I received some very nice gifts and was completely flattered. There was quite a bit of chatter and some catching up with friends that I see less often. Eventually we moved onto playing some games in groups. However, I had a long day at work and was very tired.

I was forced into a significant pay cut and I had to impose further stress on my family to tighten our budget.

He came over one day and started trying to take my things, which he's not legally allowed to do before I was evicted. He completely ignored the eviction process for over a month.

Because of this my landlord started an eviction process. Unfortunately this turned into a fiasco that I'll never forget. He went completely insane. My landlord started beating on my door threatening to kick it down and to attack me physically. This was way outside of the normal legal process of eviction. We eventually had an altercation and I had to call the police on him. They arrested him and I continued to live in the residence until he got out of jail about a month later.

Not like oh my knee is sore pain, but ouch I don't know if I can walk pain. I tried to tough it out for a few days but it was no use, I had to have it looked at. Getting in to see the doctor was the usual trouble, call to book an appointment, nothing open for a while but finally I did. After a brief examination the diagnosis was clear: I had a knee injury and would need surgery. After a few more doctor visits for examinations, meeting the surgeon, discussing the procedure, the day finally came for the surgery. I went in for knee surgery in January. After being admitted and put in a gown and bed, the last meeting with the doctors took place. At the end of it the anesthesiologist asked a series of questions just as final confirmation. ""Are you allergic to any medications?"" No I replied. ""Do you have sleep apnea or any breathing disorders."" No I don't I said, thinking that I had already wrote this all in a questionnaire. ""Is there any possibility that you could be pregnant?"" No I am not pregnant I said. ""This is very important though, is there ANY possibility that you could be pregnant?"" Hmm I thought. I didn't feel pregnant, but then again I had never been before, how would I know? So I said ""yes, it's possible I suppose, what does that mean?"" I'll tell you what it means. It means that your knee surgery gets postponed while they administer a pregnancy test. It means they have to do a second test, and then a third one to confirm. It means I went for a simple surgery and instead found out I was 5 months pregnant. It turns out that they couldn't do the surgery when I was pregnant, the danger to the fetus was too great. My surgery was cancelled. After a closer examination of my knee they decided the problem with my knee could wait a few months for surgery, or may even resolve on its own with physiotherapy. But there was one complication of my knee problem that none of us ever expected: I gave birth to my son in May.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZP0X852,0.0,imagined

We weren't able to really do this before besides random holiday meet ups sporadically so it really was a nice change of pace. We got to really spend some time together that wasn't rushed and catch up on at least a decade worth of misc stuff. It was surprising how much fun it was because I always had memories of being bored out of my mind. I guess when you're a kid/teen you would rather be doing other stuff but now that I'm an adult I understood the value of it. I wish I could go back in time and tell myself not to squander these moments as we never know if they will be the last. Some of my family had passed away in the time frame from when we last met up for the holidays and the reunion so I won't ever get to spend time with them again and that sucks. It was really good to see my aunt and uncle again as they are the most similar to myself with our love for technology and in general relaxed personalities. I wish I had connected with them much sooner but when my parents divorced people kind of took sides and it was hard to reach over the divide. I won't make that mistake again I want to keep these relationships going so we did promise to keep in weekly or bi weekly contact. We are all in general bad at communication so hopefully we can keep this up and I will try to take control of it being the youngest. I guess personally I am at fault for the divide when it comes to this family. I should've been the one to really reconnect us years ago but I was just generally absorbed in the grind of life and my immediate friends/family that I didn't try. I will look at my relationships with my distant family and friends more so we stay more connected. It was great to write about this again because I feel like this is a different view from the last time since I have been chatting with my family more since the last time I did this.,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,,0.0,retold

I got to see my distant family that I hadn't seen in decades since I was a kid and close ones that I rarely see. It was cool to see my grandpa because It's honestly been at least 25 years and since he is handicap it's hard for him to get around. He also lives on the opposite coast so it is just hard to meet up. He was looking in pretty good health about the same as when he left so that was good to see considering all the time that has passed. My grandma was there too I had my issues in the past with her but it was still nice to see her. She treated my mom poorly so we don't talk much but I put aside my issues just for this small time period to make the gathering go smooth. I got to see my favorite aunt and uncle who both shared similar passions to me with computers and tech stuff and it's been like 20 years since I saw them so that was sweet. Basically they are the same as I remember just older but they are just as into tech stuff as they were back then. I remember I would bring my GameBoy or old PC games over to their house and they would know about them or have them themselves. Just really good memories honesty that I was happy to remember with how stressful life has been. Finally I got to just catch up with some other family members like my cousins and some others who I didn't remember as well cause I was so young back then. This might have been the last time a lot of us get to meet because we all live so far apart and aren't exactly wealthy so we tried to make the most of it. We took a lot of pictures and overall had a great time and we pledged to try and talk over the phone/webcam more often. I hope everyone gets to meet up with their family at some point because in the end it's all that you have and you don't want to waste that.,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,3Q8GYXHFEQOY77CMCZYLDNXI6SXC5K,0.0,recalled

We were invited there as our friends has reserved a beach house and a few rooms were going to be empty anyways. It was a lot of fun to be at the beach. It's memorable for a few reasons. The first is that I got to see my oldest child build up the courage to get into the ocean for the first time. She was very pensive at first and was crying. I was able to sit down next to her and tell her that it was safe and there was nothing to be afraid of. Eventually she was able to fight her fears, with the help of her mom and our friend, and get into the water. It made me feel very proud to see her build up the courage to get in the water. Another reason is that my youngest daughter was able to nap on the beach for a few hours. She is normally a crazy kid with boundless energy, so it was very surprising to see her calm down and sleep that way. It gave me a lot of happiness to see how much fun my kids had and how well they got along with the other kids that were present. The reason that this event will be significant for me is that it was one of the first vacations that we have had as a family. It was also mostly positive and mostly stress free. It was something that I hope to do more of in the future.",,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM0U1T5Q,0.0,recalled

One night I heard a loud noise and jumped out of bed, running to the living room because I thought the noise had come from out there. Seeing nothing and returning to my room, I saw that the area right next to my bed was on fire because my phone or laptop had overheated and exploded next to my bed. The most memorable part of this event to me was how tall the fire was next to my bed, and the realization that we weren't going to be able to put it out because it had grown too quickly. I woke up my mom, who ran to the side of the bed and began trying to smother the fire out, but it was too big and continued spreading, We went to my brother's room and woke him up, causing his cat to startle and run to the kitchen. At this point the fire had continued spreading through the house, but my brother ran into the kitchen and wouldn't leave until he had his cat, so we had to help him coax her out before we could all leave the house. We then left the house and called my dog, who followed us out. We called the fire department as we began walking to my uncle's house because our car keys had been left inside. We waited at our uncle's house for over half an hour (our house is very difficult to find) until we finally saw the fire truck come into view of our driveway. They went back to our house and put the fire out, but by then it was too late and all of my stuff along with most of my house had been destroyed. We then called my dad, who was working the night shift, to let him know what had happened. He left work and drove to our aunt's house, while we tried to contact our insurance because we had been informed that there was a chance they would put us up in a hotel while we waited on our house to be rebuilt. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Not only would they not pay for us to temporarily stay somewhere, but they also weren't going to pay for the rebuild. We had the cheapest insurance plan, which meant that the most they would do was pay off the rest of our mortgage, which was almost paid off anyways. Having nowhere else to stay and no way to rebuild, we had to move in with my great-grandmother.",3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4,,0.0,retold

I was in my bedroom when I heard a loud popping noise at about 4 in the morning. I jumped out of bed and ran into the living room to see what the noise was, and, seeing nothing, returned to my bedroom to discover that the noise had been something exploding next to my bed and my room was on fire. Both my laptop and phone were plugged in next to my bed, and it's unclear which one overheated and caused the fire, but by the time I noticed the fire had started there was no time to put it out. I woke up my family and we grabbed our pets and ran outside. We called the fire department, but our house is located in the middle of the woods in a very rural area, so it took them an hour to find us. We actually walked to the end of the end of the driveway and tried to flag them down as they drove up and down the road looking for our address, but it took them a while to see us. When they finally got back to our house, most of it had burned. My room, my brothers room, the hallway, the kitchen, my mom's room, the living room, and the bathroom were mostly destroyed. The parts of the house that hadn't burned were destroyed by water damage from putting the fire out. Everyone else in my family was able to sift through the rubble the next day to find that, although their walls, floors, and clothes were ruined, a lot of their possessions remained in tact. Because the fire had started in my room, however, every single thing I owned was burned to ash. This was an emotional, frightening, and stressful event; however, it was not as sad or discouraging as most people would think. Two weeks before my house burned down, my friends' house also burned, only her dad got trapped inside and died. Even though I lost all my material things, I could only look at my family and be grateful that everyone made it out alive, even our pets!",3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4,3QECW5O0KINFTOEXYLTB2XXM2B35T4,0.0,recalled

I was excited to finally go camping for the first time but also somewhat anxious. The camping site we decided on was at a state park in Texas. The drive there was quite long, but once we found our campsite it was time to start exploring. We walked around the park and admired the scenery. However, some of the most beautiful scenery was while we were hiking down the trails. When the sun went down, we all gathered around a campfire and starting telling stories about the past. At the same time, we were cooking hotdogs and burgers. When it was time to sleep, we went to our respective tents. My tent could have the top removed and I could see all of the stars. There was also the sound of birds and crickets that felt relaxing to listen to. The next day, we climbed the hardest trail at the park. Once making it to the top of the mountain, we saw an American flag waving in the wind. The scenery at the top was one of the most breathtaking things I've seen in my life.

It was the first time I've ever gone camping so I was a bit anxious and excited. The place we were camping was a state park in Texas. When we got there we set up our tents and walked around the park and did some exploring. It was a breath of fresh air to get away from everything and spend some time outside with family. My brothers and I went on a few trails and the scenery was beautiful. At one point, we even saw a few deer running by. Nightfall eventually came and we went back to our campsite. We lit a fire and started cooking some hotdogs while talking about nostalgic memories that happened within our family. When it was time for me to go to bed, I went into my tent and laid down. It was quite hot so it took some time to get relaxed but the sounds of all of the birds and nature helped put me to sleep. The next day is when the most significant event of the trip occurred. We decided to complete the highest and most elevated trail of the park. It was tough and a lot of climbing was involved, but after some struggle and a few hours we finally made it to the top. At the peak of the mountain stood an American flag and a wave of relief went through me when I finally saw it. Looking down you could see all of the rivers and trees, the landscape was incredible. It will definitely be a moment I won't ever forget.",3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C71844FO,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C71844FO,0.0,recalled

We had never discussed the idea prior. We were almost 3,000 miles from home, visiting San Francisco, California to see the final Warped Tour and our favorite band together. It was something we had been planning for quite some time, and we were both very excited about it. The morning he proposed he told me he had the whole day planned out and to dress cute because he could take pictures to send home. He took me to the Japanese Tea Garden, which is a place I had wanted to see for quite some time. We spent about an hour walking around the garden and just seeing the sights, and he seemed a little nervous the entire time. Honestly I just thought maybe he was still a little tied from the flight. They had a table ready for us next to the water and he ordered my favorite tea and some small snacks. We talked for a little bit and took some silly pictures by the water. Everyone there already knew it was about to happen, he had called over 2 months ago to make sure everything was ready and that he was going to be able to pull it off. They were ready to take pictures and capture the moment for us. It was beautiful and so well planned out. He really made it a memorable event for me and I'm very happy with the way it turned out. I couldn't have planned it better myself.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C7B62F43,0.0,recalled

She was found on her apartment floor. She had a lot of health issues due to the way she lived her life. Smoking and drinking throughout most of it. We never had the type of relationship I wanted but I am learning to be more at peace with it now.  When I first found out I was upset but I was still felt ok. Then I talked to my brother on the phone and next think I know I was talking weird. My blood pressure spiked I was having a panic attack. My fiance rushed home to find me on the floor. She wanted me to go to the hospital but I could not do it. I pleaded with her not to go just let me lay. I did lay down and was able to calm myself. I scheduled a doctors appt to get some medicine to help me cope. I know am finally learning to be at peace with it and putting more time into my relationship with my 4 year old son. My mothers passing is behind me and I can move on. May she rest in peace with my father.,3QILPRALQ6H0LTSFZNE25I1LGLVN85,,0.0,retold

We were not as close and I regret not being there for her in her untimely death. I started having anxiety attacks shortly after. I couldn't even be around people talking about her without freaking out. I soon after got help and started processing my grief properly. The main thing I can say is there is always help for whatever you are going through; You have to find the strength to be proactive and find it. This event happened 6 months ago. We always butted heads and didn't see eye to eye. I regret some things I said to her in the past and how I pushed her away. I wish she got to see my son more than what she did. No matter how much I regret certain things I try to remember our good moments together. She meant well at heart and I hope she found peace.

I was absolutely terrified that he was no going to live.  I had gotten home and discovered him laying on his side in pain in the middle of the night.  I felt his bladder and realized that it was a hard as a rock.  I immediately put him in a carrier and brought him to the emergency medical center for pets.  The vet there had a urinary catheter placed but not without complications.  His urethral passage was no narrow that she was struggling to place the catheter.  Without the urinary catheter, my cat was going to need a surgery I knew I wouldn't be able to afford.  I was so heartbroken and scared that I was going to have to euthanize my cat.  Thankfully, the vet was able to place the urinary catheter and flushed out his bladder.  I felt so relieved that he was going to be able to make it through the night.  It gave me the time needed to be able to contact our regular vet in the morning and to be able to transfer him there.  I spent all night thinking about my cat and hoping that he would be okay.  Once I did transfer him to the regular vet, she recommended that he have surgery to widen his urethral passage.  This would help prevent future blockages that he would like have.  Thankfully, surgery at our regular vet is much cheaper than surgery at the medical emergency center.  Therefore, I was able to provide him the preventive surgery.  After that surgery was done, I felt so much better.  All he had to do was recover from the surgery and I was grateful that he was going to live.  This experience has made me more aware of how both my cats are doing in terms of their health.  I think about this event a few times of month because I know that cats who have been blocked before can get blocked again.  It makes me feel cautious and truly appreciate having my cat with me today.",3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B,,0.0,retold

When I got home, Nyx was laying on his side almost lifeless and barely moving.  Out of concern, I felt his bladder and it was very hard.  Realizing that Nyx was actually blocked, I woke my dad and sister up and said that we need to go to MedVet immediately because he probably wasn't going to make it until our regular vet opened.  We rushed him to the closest animal hospital and the vet techs immediately took him to the back room.  I felt terrified that he was going to die.  When the veterinarian informed us that Nyx was actually a male cat, I felt angry that the shelter we got him from misinformed me.  I would have told me sister to take Nyx to the vet when she first texted me if I had known that Nyx was a male cat.  I knew blockages were more likely to occur in males and I wouldn't have risked his life by telling her to wait until I got home.     On top of feeling terrified Nyx is going to die, I was also very anxious about the financial cost.  My dad was very kind and offered to help me pay for it, so that help me a bit more relief.  The veterinarian said that Nyx's urethral passage was so unusually narrow that the vet techs were having trouble placing a urinary catheter in to drain his bladder.  If they couldn't place a urinary catheter, then the prognosis was not going to be good for Nyx.  While we could afford temporary care until we got Nyx to his regular vet when they opened, we could not afford to pay for a surgery at the animal hospital.  The whole situation felt hopeless to me.  I felt very anxious and I was shaking the entire time until I learned that they finally managed to place the urinary catheter.  I was finally able to go home and sleep for a couple of hours.       As soon as Nyx's regular vet opened, I picked up Nyx from the animal hospital and felt so relieved that he looked a little more lively.  His regular vet told us he would likely need surgery to widen his urethra in order to prevent this from happening again.  Nyx ended up staying the rest of the weekend at the regular vet before coming home with me.  Overall, the whole experience was terrifying, upsetting, and made me feel anxious.",3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8ED0QVN1B,0.0,recalled

I was with her when she died.  She had a long history of poor health - she was a breast cancer survivor, had kidney issues, had a triple by-pass many years ago, has had pneumonia...many, many issues over the years.  And she was a bit of a hyprochondriac as well.  So this time when she went into the hospital, I didn't know how serious it was.  She was in the hospital at least once every other year.  As always, I went to see her, talked to the doctors, etc.  This isn't the first time it looked really bad.  But after a few days,  I could tell this time it was different.  She couldn't feed herself, her memory was sketchy.  I went to visit her everyday and finally the staff and I started talking hospice care.  But before that could happen, I got a call at work that she was close to death.  I rushed to the hospital and she was barely conscious.  I arranged for last rites and sat holding her hand.  A few hours later, she slipped away.  I sat with her a bit longer before letting the nurse know.  I had papers to sign and then I left the hospital.  It was so strange leaving her there.  I just didn't know what to do.  But I had to call family to let them know and figure out the next steps.  I hated that while I was trying to grieve I had so many ""things"" to take care of.",,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8EDB9A1NH,0.0,recalled

As the conversation progressed, we realized that the other guy and I were from the same city and he and my older brother attended the same high school at the same time. We all had a lot of fun conversing and enjoying the food. Upon leaving we all talked a bit more. I mentioned my high school to which the guy responded his sister went there. I asked for her name and realized she was someone I had known since middle school. It was so crazy to find out all these connections to someone who started off a total stranger.

I had no professional knowledge for the new assignment of work therefore I was in charge of the position for 6 months but not feeling comfortable.  I asked for the resignation to locate another job in my outstanding area of work. For me it was an overwhelming experience because. I had to change jobs already having a family with an older son and a second newborn daughter, those must be the experiences that my mother tells you that change your life and in fact it was that way from that moment. I looked for Being independent and being able to share even more with my family for both me and my family has been a drastic change because I was used to receiving orders and for the first time in my life I could be my own boss without restriction of schedule and without having a control Total about my life. So I felt that it was my mother until after retiring that it was time for me more attached to her and changed our lives forever and I feel that I change mine because I am doing it with my children. I am very happy to work full time for me i own company and that way I can teach my children that they should not be dependent but instead they can be independent and realize their own dreams. I think we need allways to keep growing that its the best form to get renovated day after day. I hope manny fathers can change their life style and they can share manny moments with their kids and family. Its a hard work because the family time demands manny time but its quality time. The best fom to give succces its with a lot of patience. All the persons in the world can change their form of life and in that form change their family lifes. Spread all your sittuations and be very communicative thats the principal improve tool. I give for al the best wishes when you are dicided ti take the fisrt step.

To the stock of spare parts in the company for me it was a very frustrating situation since I had no professional knowledge for the new assignment of work therefore. I was in charge of the position for 6 months but not feeling comfortable I asked for the resignation to locate another job in my outstanding area of work. It was really frustrating for me to be in that situation since I had to financially support my family and also get a new job where both me and my bosses would consider me appropriate and prepared to face the challenges and be able to develop in the area as I was prepared for my job. Previously, in the sales area, therefore, my opportunity was to migrate to another company where I could accommodate my potential and be able to exploit it and in that way continue to stand out and not go through uncomfortable situations within the area where I was working after the dismissal of my colleagues. I am sure that for me and for the company it is more productive for me to start in another company than to continue working in the current one since in addition to not having the necessary knowledge. I have the knowledge and experience in other areas very different from those I am placed by my bosses and due to those decisions I must resign as soon as possible and focus on new goals with new bosses and new company. I think that in life we are always willing to have to make changes but always for the better and that is why I decide the change in the company where I work for more than 12 years and therefore. I am forced to change companies to follow my instincts of great seller and that way continue to assist my clients to whom I owe respect and great value.  I must also give my family the best example of moving forward despite the circumstances and not be discouraged under any circumstances. With that commitment and dedication they will feel appreciated and loved by a family leader who gives all his effort to always locate the better conditions for my family nucleus.  With my new job I feel very moved since I show that when you have some obstacles you decide if you face them or you do not achieve any change and I always decide to overcome them because that has been a large part of my life to overcome obstacles and achieve goals in order to take more satisfactions to my life and my family nucleus. For me and my family, it is satisfying to have achieved my goals at all critical moments in life. The best form to work its your best arm in all the spaces where you need to be guided.  Therefore my teaching for my children and those who want my advice is always to be original and fulfill their dreams.  When completing each stage of my life, always be aware of all the achievements and thus motivate future generations.",3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLNC0,3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NLNC0,0.0,recalled

He was in the hospital due to problems with his legs and congestive heart failure.  He seemed to be doing better than he had been and he was sitting up when we came into the room. and watching a baseball game on TV.  His doctor had actually told him he'd be getting out the next day so he was in a good mood.  I took my 12-year old son with me and he wore a St. Patty's day blow-up hat that everybody was laughing at and my brother thought was funny.  My mother was there visiting also and she thought the hat was funny.  I also brought him a flower centerpiece for his room that was St. Patty's day related.  He wanted to talk to his wife who was in the Philippines and I tried to help him call her, but we were unable to get her on the phone.  He also wanted me to get him some sugar-free candy as I usually picked some up in the store in the lobby of the hospital when I visited, but it is a smaller hospital and the store was closed because it was Sunday.  So, I offered to go to Walmart nearby to get him some.  I left and came back with the candy and he was very happy that I did this.  One odd thing that happened is I saw a friend who I used to work with at Walmart which was surprising as this area was quite a distance from where I thought this friend lived.  But, my friend told me she had recently moved to that area.  I was unable to go back to visit him when he took a turn for the worse within the next week and was sent to ICU.  I came down with the flu and I did not want to spread my germs in the hospital and definitely not to my brother.

My brother lived in a town about 50 miles away, so I was surprised that I saw a former co-worker when I went to the Walmart.  We are Facebook friends, but I still had no clue she had moved recently to that city.  Anyway, my brother was so happy to have a little hard candy that was sugar free (I got him some peppermints) and he hugged me tight before I left.  I did not get a chance to come back to see him later that week when he went to ICU due to some heart issues as I came down with the flu and I feel badly about that.

Seeing him standing at the plate ready to swing at a pitch erased so many years in-between.  My husband coached him when he was starting out and through his high school years which culminated in his winning a scholarship to play in college.  We traveled all over watching him pitch and so this day, watching him play again made me go back in time in my head because all the sights and sounds were the same.  He stood in the batter's box in the same exact way.  So many things have happened since that earlier time.  He played professionally for a time.  He's since married and had a child but while I was sitting and watching him it might just as well have been 25 years ago.  Time goes by so quickly that we're hardly aware of the changes that happen.  It made me very happy to be brought back to that simpler time that day. I hope that he continues to play in the spring.  He swore he'd never play as an adult but it obviously agreed with him.

They were together for so many years as my husband coached him and he played shortstop mostly and was trained to be a pitcher.  I sat at all of his games, watching them both interact together and it was a special thing to see.  I didn't know anything about baseball when I was growing up.  I had two sisters and we really didn't play sports.  As they progressed in skill over the years, my knowledge of the game increased to the point where I might have been able to coach a time myself. So many thing happened over those years but the constant was always baseball. My son graduated and went to college on a baseball scholarship.  After he graduated, he wound up playing minor league ball for a time and we traveled to see him play. Once he started his business career, he turned his attention to his other interests and there were no more games to attend.

Being a military family means making sacrifices for the greater good, even when that means distance from family or maybe even your spouse. This past year has been so hard. Driving across the country with a toddler and buying a home unseen were not things we thought we would have to do this quickly. We are now on our own. We have no family close and are trying our best to get settled in our new environment. Our son has begun preschool. He has blossomed in such a short amount of time. Although we miss our family and friends dearly, we are doing our best to plan visits. We have found a playgroup and even the dogs seems to be adjusting well. There have been a few attempts to start a business but those are continually halted due to anxiety. There are so many adjustments that will be made in the next few months. We will continue to work on the progress we have made as a family. We plan to work together to make this new place home.",,3R0T90IZ1TYWN416TVHCHKO7EWCGCF,0.0,recalled

He was finally at that age where he would enjoy a day of friends and family dedicated just to him. The previous day we went to Walmart and gathered enough supplies for the attending bunch. Paper plates, plastic silverware, burgers, hotdogs, soda, you name it, we got it all. The special day came and one by one relatives from all around traveled here. My parents drove 3 states to be here. And my wife's parents drove 4! My sister in law also drove nearly 2 hours to bring her daughter here, who's a special friend of my son. The party went amazing, we grilled up some burgers and hotdogs. Both of our parents brought a variety of homemade foods as well. We had a full buffet going which made my sons eyes light up as he loves food. We played games throughout the party that he could enjoy. Tag, bean bag toss, monkey in the middle, we even had a pinata.  However the best moment was when we brought out his cake. We had them decorate it with his favorite superhero and he went wild. Probably the biggest smile I've ever seen on him. We cut him out a slice and he dug his face right in! Today was such a magical day.

Right as I finished up my homework I received a call from my aunt telling me that my grandmother had passed away. I had tried to see my grandmother during Thanksgiving but it had snowed a lot that morning so there was no way that I could drive out to my aunts house where Thanksgiving was being held so the last time that I saw my grandmother was the Christmas lodge the year before. I usually only had a chance to see my grandmother a couple of times a year and hadn't realized how long it had been until after the funeral. I wasn't very on top of calling her either because I just get so wrapped up in my own life that I forget to reach out to family who live so far away. I didn't even really know what to think when I received the call saying that my grandmother had already passed away. A month before she died she had experienced a stroke, but they thought that she was actually getting better. I wasn't prepared to lose my grandmother at all. My grandfather has experienced three strokes and he is still alive. After the funeral it hit me how she was actually gone and I wasn't going to be able to play games with her or eat her wonderful cookies that she makes for Christmas. I also wouldn't be able to go and stay at her house anymore with my family. There would be no more Christmas parade that the town puts on the weekend after Thanksgiving. All of these things that I took for granted while she was alive hit me after the funeral like a ton of bricks. I was never going to get to see her again and it had been a year since I had.

My sister and her daughter were with me. This was my first cruise and I had to go because my sister paid for it! It started out with a short flight into Texas where we then drove to Galveston to board the ship. We finally did board and went through all the required things that you have to do on a cruise ship. Our room was beautiful but a little cramped with the three of us. But we had a balcony which made it worth the inconvenience. We sailed for two days. Watching the ocean from the balcony was so relaxing and beautiful. We ate meals in the dining room. Fabulous food. On the third day we entered port at Cozumel. There was a lot of touristy stuff to look at, but we were headed to a beach to sit in the sun and swim in the ocean. It was very hot and humid.  We found a beach and spent the day there. We ate at a real Mexican restaurant. While on the ship we got to see some shows for entertainment. Our next stop was at Progresso. Very sad place. We did another beach trip and again laid in the sun and swam in the ocean. Taking the bus back thru town after that was really eye-opening. The poverty of that town was so sad. Little more than hovels and dirty streets. Back on the ship we again dined at the eateries. We spent some time on the way home lounging on deck or by one of the many pools.",3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZA564UAH,3R3YRB5GRGPRZ753TMA2F4ZA564UAH,0.0,recalled

I'm not sure why, but on that particular day I was having a hard time making it to the top. The hike was ultimately a tough battle, but when I made it to the top the views were breathtaking. I learned that day that sometimes the mountain does not simply hand you a win. Sometimes victories must be earned through hard work and determination. I left the hike that day feeling incredibly accomplished. I have since been back to hike that trail at least one other time.

When I reached the summit of the mountain I felt a great sense of personal pride and accomplishment. I love hiking and I consider it a big part of who I am as a person. I spent at least two years of my life hiking several times a month. I would mostly go hiking alone. I like hiking alone because I learn something new about myself each time.

It was as special to me as it was for the bride and groom. A few days ago, I was having dinner with my friend whose wedding played an important role in my life.  We went through some pictures from the wedding album as we took a stroll down memory lane. As I went through the pictures, I refreshed my memory about how the wedding planning started and how it all came together. The hard work that went into and the final outcome that made me realize the part I played in the entire event. People often say that family events matter a lot. But in this case it was a close friend whose wedding became an event even bigger than anything I had ever done for a family member. It was a great honor to have been chosen by the bride to be a part of the wedding planning. The toast raised to thank me for my hard work was a surprise and even today it makes me tear up a little. I sincerely hope that my friend is able to help someone near and dear to her like I did. So she can enjoy the moment of being part of an immensely joyful event. The effort and hard work that goes into planning an event as big as a wedding is certainly rewarding when it becomes a success. Just knowing that your gestures and planning has made two people happy and helped build memories for life to cherish. It sometimes makes me wonder about the time and effort that goes into organizing an event as significant as a wedding and the outcome of that final day coming into play.",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG,,0.0,retold

I felt very involved in the event as I played a major role in the planning of the wedding. I was one of the bridesmaids and had helped my friend with her wedding shopping and organization. I remember waking up really early that morning and feeling a different kind of excitement, even more than I felt on my own wedding day. I helped my friend get ready with her hair and makeup and made sure that the guests were taken care of. I also helped her family members make reservations for the following day as most of them had traveled from other cities to attend the event. Although it was a bit exhausting, it gave me great satisfaction to help in the wedding. I barely had a chance to sit down and even enjoy a glass of wine. But what made me feel emotional was the toast that my friend made where she mentioned me more than her own family. After all it was the most beautiful wedding ceremony, an event I can never forget. The emotions that my friend felt that day brought back memories of my own wedding. The jitters, the excitement and the anticipation were all a part of the big day. I could take a strol down memory lane and reminisce the day I tied the knot. I often sit back and play the wedding ceremony in my mind to try to remember how the events unfolded. I feel that being a part of my friend's big day was a great experience because I never felt that way before. No one else had given me that opportunity to participate in a big way in their wedding planning.",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG,3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBJRVGTG,0.0,recalled

We had such a great time, and it was a memorable bonding experience for us.  It was like we had stepped onto the movie set of the Harry Potter movies.  We really felt like kids, walking around with our custom-made wands, waving them to cast spells.  I was surprised that we weren't the only people there with no children.  I guess kids of all ages love Harry Potter!  We were pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was while we were there.  Amusement park food has a reputation for being bland and greasy, but everything we ate or drank while we were there was outstanding.  We ate at the Leaky Cauldron and the Three Broomsticks, of course, but we also tried several restaurants and snack stands in other parts of the park.  Everything was fresh and tasty.  There were even healthy options available at several places, something that can be very difficult to find at theme parks.  The variety of souvenirs available was also impressive.  Most of the time, parks will have the same items scattered across numerous different shops, but each store at Universal had its own theme and unique items.  We did see some repeats, but most places had their own things.  We finally had to start taking photos of items and labeling them with the name of the store, since we wanted to see everything before we made our final decisions on purchases.  We were able to ride all of the rides and attractions we wanted to experience while we were there, and got to ride many of them more than once.  We were very surprised by the short wait times, even on popular rides.  There were a couple of times that we were able to walk directly onto the ride without having to wait at all!  Overall, this trip was an experience of a lifetime.  I truly hope that we can take another trip together soon!",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBSKIGTY,,0.0,retold

I wanted us to do something special for her 40th birthday, so I took her to Universal Studios Orlando so we could visit The Wizarding World of Harry Potter! It was the first time we had been on vacation with just the two of us.  We had so much fun!  We stayed out late every night, and racked up over 30,000 steps on our last day in the parks!  Needless to say, we were exhausted at the end of the day, but it was worth it!  We got to ride all the rides we wanted, got to try three different kinds of butterbeer, and got to have ice cream from Florean Fortescue's.  Our favorite ride was the one that goes through the Hogwarts castle. It was like being right there in the movies!  Another good one was the ride that went through Gringotts Bank.  It was funny to watch the people jump when the dragon on top blew his fireball.  We made sure to eat at both The Leaky Cauldron and The Three Broomsticks.  Both had really good food, especially for a theme park.  While we were there, we heard that they're going to open a new ride that's based on Hagrid's motorcycle We will have to make a return trip to ride that one once the hype has died down.  Another of our favorite spots was the Dr. Seuss world.  It was fun to see all the characters, and they seemed to have some of the best shirts and merchandise. A really cool restaurant was the Toothsome Chocolate Emporium.  It's decorated in 19th century steampunk decor, and was really unusual.  Their ices cream sundaes averaged $15 each, but they were well worth it.  The one I got had a whole piece of red velvet cake on top of it!  We made sure to take lots of pictures to remember the trip. This was definitely a bonding experience for us that we will remember for the rest of our lives.",3R6P78PK7LXD9L3HFHC26UOBSKIGTY,,0.0,recalled

I've quit hiking, going to movies. I've cut off all contact with all of my friends. No one understands, so what's the point in talking to people?

About three months ago something amazing happened to me. I bought my first home! The process was a long and drawn out one but so worth it in the end. I looked at house after house after house and finally settled on the perfect one for me. I started the process months before I actually purchased. It took a long time finding a home because I am so indecisive and I didn't want to make a mistake and buy something I would hate in the future. This caused me to want to see any and everything that was available. Even after I thought I had seen it as I contemplated which house to purchase I couldn't decide. I received a phone call from my realtor a few days after all the showings available to me were over and she communicated to me that there was one brand new listing that we had not seen. This turned out to be the one. It was everything I wanted and dreamed of when I first started the process of buying a home. I was in love with the house and put in an offer immediately. My offer was accepted and sometime later I moved in and have been loving life ever since. I don't want to live anywhere else. Although this was a daunting task, I wouldn't change how it all played out.",3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2KI8LLA,3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2KI8LLA,0.0,recalled

Time has passed, but I still feel the pain of my father's death just a vividly as when it happened.

During the time we spent, it was just enjoying each other's company. I never realized that I was making memories. There are so many things that were memorable about my father. When we were misbehaving as children, instead of other punishments, he would have us build on my mother's brick flowerbed walls. We would mix the mortar, lay the brick, set and clean. The permanence of the walls was a metaphor for the character we built, I came to realize later. I walked past a flower garden recently and was suddenly reminded of all the time we had worked on the flowerbeds. I had not thought about them for many years, but suddenly remembered them in detail.

To get there, we took shifts driving, with each of us driving 3 hours! When we got to the expo, we were really exhausted, to say the least. It all began with a bunch of guest lecturers telling us their pieces and great advice in areas that they all specialize in. I was greatly informed on things that I never had considered before. After that, we were informed we'd all participate in a contest against each other! It was split up into a bunch of teams, 3 on each team, and I was very nervous and didn't think I had a shot at all in winning the prize.

He surprised me with a birthday ticket to the whole event, which really was a pleasant thing. The whole point of the expo was to promote proper nutrition and training when you adapt it to a full body workout experience. At the very least, I was hoping to get some really good information for future reference! We had to drive over 5 hours to get there by car, but it was not too bad since we split up the drive between us two. Anyways, while there, we also competed in a contest with over one hundred other individuals of varying levels of fitness! It was a crazy experience, and I was very nervous to perform in front of so many people, especially ones that were definitely more fit than me (at least they seemed to be). Some of these guys looked like they were bodybuilders and had been working out like that for many many years! I only happened to start the program just a year ago. I did put a lot of effort into the workouts leading up to this, but I definitely think I had my work cut out for me! Crazy enough though, I actually outperformed them and won first place! I was ecstatic and couldn't believe it. Little old me, who was half the size of most of the people there, on his first try did what seemed like the impossible. My friend told me that it was all the hard work I put in prior to this expo, which really made me feel happy and glad that I agreed to join him on this trip. What a great weekend!",3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR1Z04LW,3S4AW7T80C49ES2SB78ABEHR1Z04LW,0.0,recalled

I can very easily see myself staying at this company for numerous years and rising even further in the ranks. I would really enjoy leading a team of analysts and having that level of power.

I am hoping for another promotion in the next review cycle and so far I have no reason to believe it won't happen.

He has been to so many doctors, and none of them have been able to help him. They just refer him to another specialist after they see their treatment does not help him.

As she got older, she proved to be very smart. She learned tricks easily. She always followed the rules. She was protective of our family, but would never harm anyone. As she got older, her hips started acting up. She had difficulty walking, so I had a special harness I used to help her get around. Even then, she was so full of energy and always on the go.

We bonded immediately. It was so great watching her grow up. I loved teaching her things and she learned very quickly. She was very protective of me, but was never aggressive unless provoked. As the years went by, her muzzle started to gray. Her joints started to ache and she couldn't play the way she used to. She tried, though. She started sleeping more.

I was amazed at what the classes and the environment had done for him. His body transformed from that of a soft, pudgy video game fanatic into the lean body of a junior Tarzan. He also came out of his shell. He is a shy, socially awkward boy and the extremely positive and supportive atmosphere helped him to be more confident in himself and more comfortable with other people. It really made me feel like I wanted to be a part of this big ""family"", so I signed up. I was still very worried that my age and the extra pounds I was carrying would be embarrassing at least and insurmountable at worst. In my very first class I met a student who was older than my mother and another who weighed over 300 pounds. They both assured me that it was fun and very doable for people of all ages and sizes. I also was treated in a very supportive and encouraging manner by everyone, regardless of their age or level of ability. I think the most surprising thing was that I apparently move really well for a 50 year old. I was really proud of myself when I realized that I could keep up with the youngsters. I'm not as fast and flexible as they are, of course, but I can make up for it with my strength and my focus on proper technique. That first class was such a positive and uplifting experience that I immediately signed up for a year of classes. I also signed up for weapons and sparring classes.

A little over a year ago, my son started taking Tae Kwon Do classes at a local martial arts school. After a year of watching my son in his classes and helping him and his friends train, I was inspired.  decided that I could make the time in my schedul;e to give it a try and I even talked my best friend in to signing up with me. I know that signing up isn't all that remarkable, but keep in mind that I am about to turn 50 and I spend all day working at a desk. I signed up a month before the next class was due to start. I spent most of that month trying really hard to get in better shape and worrying that I had made a huge mistake and would end up embarrassing myself and my son. There were a lot of push ups and jumping jacks and every other exercise I could think of. There was also a lot of cursing and wishing I was 10 years younger. I also spent a good amount of time practicing things I had learned with and from my son. Then the big day finally came. It was the first day of class and I showed up ready for class and full of nervous energy. Both my son and my wife made a special effort to be there to watch...no pressure! When class started I jumped in and worked hard at everything the instructor threw at us. I still felt pretty lame and foolish next to many of the other students, most whom were decades younger than me. Then, near the end of class, the instructor had us do a kicking trial to see how good we were to start with. The assessment reqwuired us to kick a thick padbeing held by a similarly sized classmate hard enough to move the student backwards across the whole training area(about 80' long). There were an odd number of students, so I was paired up with the instructor...no pressure! To be fair, the instructor decided to participate too and show us what he could do. Well, not only did I have no trouble at all moving my instructor across the room, when it was his turn, he could barely move me at all. I kept hearing calls from the other students and the spectators, such as,""he's a tank"",and,""how is he doing that?"". I knoiw it's egotistcal, but those few minutes washed away all my embarrassment and doubt and really made me proud of myself and my aging body.",3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEE5LTD9,3S96KQ6I9NQAX1TQDRBU09LEE5LTD9,0.0,recalled

He was thrown from the passenger sent out of the front dash because he wasn't wearing a seat belt.  His friend was obviously too drunk to be driving, but survived because he did have his seat belt on.  In my cousin's post, as I said before, she mentioned that she was there and that as he and his friend were leaving, she thought to herself, that it was a bad idea for them to be on the road and maybe someone should call cab.  This post is so frustrating for me.  I want so badly to have met this man.  My oldest son looks exactly like him and, oh, the pain when someone see him and says so.  I always hear, ""Your uncle would have just been so tickled with him (my son).""  Yes, I believe he would be and would have been with me, too, as a child growing up.  I feel robbed of his presence in my life, even though I understand that he made the decisions that lead to his death.  Now with the added insult of knowing another family member was there and didn't make a effort help adds even more sickening feelings into my already overflowing pot of emotions.  Unfortunately, my cousin is now also deceased for nearly a year and I am angry and frustrated at the fact I can't pick her brain about that night or find any closure on my anger with her for not helping because she's dead, too.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE5UNAX9,,0.0,retold

He choose to get into a car with a friend driving, and not wear a seat belt.  They were both intoxicated.  My whole life I have heard so many wonderful stories about him and how full of life he was.  About a month ago, while scrolling through an old Facebook post that a family member had posted a picture marking that my uncle would have been 60 years old.  I saw where another family member of mine who just recently passed due to years of substance abuse, had commented.  She wrote that she was there at the bar that night, and realized that as he was leaving she should have stopped him, but didn't.  I have such horrible feelings about seeing this post.  Since she is also dead, there is no way for me to confront her and find some sort of resolution.   How could she have let he just walk out knowing what state he was in?  I have been left now after finding this information out, in such a state of turmoil.  I'm not sure how to reconcile my feelings.  I have always felt cheated in life that I never got to know him, and this comment that I discovered on Facebook makes it so much worse.  I realize that he made his own choices, and that they were not good ones.  I just wish my cousin had one moment in her life where she wasn't a complete waste and speak up for him and possibly keep him safe.  I hate her.  I never really liked her much because of how her drug/alcohol abuse made her act, but now I harbor such contempt with no way to confront her.  It's one of those things everyone tells you to give to God.  I'm trying.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE5UNAX9,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE5UNAX9,0.0,recalled

We provide beginner gardens for low income people so they can grow their own vegetables. We give them dirt and plants and seeds to get started. We even provide containers for them if they don't have a yard to plant in. The local gardeners and high school career center students grow tomato and pepper plants and donate them to the event for the people to use to start their gardens. I volunteer at this every year. It's fun to see how excited the children are to be able to pick plants that they want. It makes me feel good because I think what we're doing is showing them another way to feed themselves that's healthy and cheap. The lady that runs it says we're helping the next generation rise out of poverty by giving them the skills to do different things that can better their lives, like growing healthy food. Maybe when they get older they'll be healthier and continue to grow their gardens and even pass the tradition down to their kids. At this year's garden giveaway they had a Big Seed contest. The charity gives the seeds to the local schools who give them to the students. Each year it's a different seed. The students are encouraged to grow the plant at home (this year it was watermelon) and bring it to the Garden Giveaway and enter it in a contest for biggest plant. My favorite part of the giveaway this year was the look on the little boy's face who won for biggest plant! He was so proud. It's moments like that that touch me the most.

It's a program that provides plants, seeds, dirt and containers with dirt for portable gardens for low income people. The lady that runs it was a friend and co-worker of mine, so when I decided to start volunteering I reached out to her and she said this was something she thought I'd like. I really wasn't sure what to expect when I got there. I had worked in a community garden before and it seemed like most of the poor people who showed up just wanted the vegetables and didn't want to really put in the work needed to maintain the garden. When I showed up I was kind of skeptical about how it would go but I was ready. The event was way more than I expected. We had over 100 people show up. They didn't seem like they were just there for a handout, they wanted to learn how to maintain and grow the gardens we were giving them. They asked about watering and sunlight and took a lot of time picking the plants they wanted to grow. The best part about it was the kids that came. Sometimes they were more excited than the parents about starting the garden. It was encouraging to see. Wendy, the lady that runs the program said changing the mindset of the next generation of low income is important and I felt like we were doing that. Teaching them about the importance of vegetables and how you can grow your own might actually help them be better and healthier adults. It made me wish I had been better about this with my own son instead of just buying all my produce from the store. I don't really know how all these gardens we gave away turned out. I'm sure maybe some people just gave up and didn't really continue and see results, but I;m sure that a lot of people did benefit from the giveaway and are enjoying the fruits of their labor today. And I'm hopeful  that down the line we helped raise some future gardeners whose life will be better because of it. The whole experience of volunteering at the giveaway left me with a good feeling and I plan to work the event in years to come. It will be interesting to see if people return and maybe even have stories to tell or pictures of their successful gardens!",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN3ZA2,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGN3ZA2,0.0,recalled

Although we visit several kinds of places such as Senior Citizens Daycare Centers, Schools for Disabled Children and Assisted- Living Homes, our favorite place to visit is Shriners Children Hospital.  When Sheriff and I do our weekly visit we actually put on a program in the hospital's auditorium. It is always amazing to me to see these happy children faces when I know they are battling serious, and sometimes terminal illnesses.  Just being in these children's presence is such a blessing and reminds me to appreciate each day. The program Sheriff and I do is quite interactive with the children, so when someone doesn't participate it is quite noticeable. About 6 months ago I would notice a young girl, probably about 7 years old, standing off to the side. She looked incredibly lonely and sad. I have learned over time to let the kids approach us or Sheriff as they deemed to be comfortable. Each week I would hold eye contact with  her for a little longer and subtly move a little closer to this girl, whose name I later learned is Rebecca.  It took about 4 weeks to get close to Rebecca, and finally one day when we were close I asked her if she would like to pet Sheriff. She approached us in a shy manner and gently put her hand on Sheriff's back. The following week she actually walked up to Sheriff and gave him a big hug. My heart felt so much overwhelmingly love for this girl. As time went on I spoke with Rebecca often and felt we had become close. It was with a heavy heart when I received a phone call from the director who asked is Sheriff and I would visit Rebecca in her room. She had become gravely terminal. It was a day of love but one of extreme sadness as well. Rebecca's mom told me that one of Rebecca's wishes was to see Sheriff. She told me that Sheriff brought so much happiness to Rebecca. That day I knew the power of Therapy Dog and what a difference they make in people's lives.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,,0.0,retold

At times I felt disheartned as it seemed we were not making any progress. And I had to remind myself that this was a long term therapy program and she was battling a terminal illness. Over about 4 weeks I would slowly get closer to her with Sheriff. During this time I would make more and more eye contact with her and hold it for longer period of times. Eventually we were about 5 feet in front of her and I could sense her curiousity. So I asked if she would like to pet Sheriff. I still remember her smile and her hesitation as she walked up to her Sheriff. She sowly reached out and touched him then backed away quickly. The next week she came up to him on her own , and the following week she came up to him and hugged him. My heart felt like it would burst. I knew then without a doubt that she would remember this moment, as I would.  Over the course of the next few months we grew close and would talk, as she  relaxed with the help of Sheriff. About a month ago, the director of the program asked if Sheriff and I would come in one day to visit Rebecca in her room. Her illness had taken a turn for the worse and she had a matter of days, if that, to live. It was an extremely sad day and a difficult day. Her mom told me that Rebecca's wish was to spend time with Sheriff as he made her happy. I knew then the power a therapy dog has to heal and warm the heart. I also knew that I would never forget this day , this experience.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPGONZAO,0.0,recalled

Two were at a community college and the other three a university. After all the blood, sweat, and tears that went into this, I finally graduated. They held it at the arena on campus, which was massive. There must have been at least 2,000 people in the crowd and at least 600 graduating with me. I didn't think that I would have many people there for me, most said they couldn't make it. That's why it was so surprising to hear so many people cheering me on when I got my diploma. I wasn't expecting it, but a lot of people showed up for me. It was really heartwarming to see. I couldn't help but smile when I walked across the stage. I figured that I would just grab my diploma and quickly walk on before anyone noticed that there were only a few people there for me. After hearing how many there were, though, I took my time and reveled in it a little. After commencement ended, I took some time to talk to my other classmates and wish them luck. I got to say goodbye to a lot of people I had spent a lot of time with. While this was sad, it was nice to know there would be so many like minded people going out there to further the field of Social Work.

This trip was meant to celebrate the 4th of July. They had a very large house and we played a lot of games and it was a fun time. We spent a lot of time in the yard playing. After that we had a big family dinner with all of family. After that we all went to bed. In the morning we had a large breakfast. After that we played for a little while longer and then said good byes. Overall I think the trip was a very fun time. I got more of a chance to play outside than I normally do. We had all different kinds of games and it felt like there was a never ending list of things to do. It's always very fun to be able to catch up with them. I don't get to see this part of my family very often so it was a very fond memory and I was surprised how much everyone had grown. I really enjoy being out there because there is house is further away from the city than mine is. I always enjoy going out there because my aunt is a very good cook. I hope I can start taking these trips more regularly.,3SKRO2GZ72DH2NNR3PD7YGX95151KA,,0.0,retold

As my grandmother, mom, and aunts prepared the food for the barbecue. The other adult gathered around different tables playing cards, dominos, shooting dice, and watching movies or sports on TV. I remember me my siblings and cousins played outside from swimming to sports. When the food was ready we gathered together and said prey and feast. After dinner we went to the family room to see a movie. That lasted a couple of hours and it was a a pretty good movie. After the movie we all went to bed.

At the time, I also had a 2 year old son so my initial reaction was panic. My husband and I had been on the fence about whether we wanted a third child, and had been trying to be careful until making a decision. The decision was apparently made for us! Throughout the pregnancy, I was full of fear. Having two toddlers was difficult enough, how would I handle a third child that close in age? Once we found out it was a girl, I started to become a little more excited since I had always wanted a daughter and over the next few months my excitement to meet her grew. I went into labor on the night of my surprise baby shower. Emma was born a little over three weeks early, but was healthy. Initially, life with three kids was difficult since my husband and I were outnumbered. We slowly developed a routine though, and things have been getting easier in the 6 months she's been here. My initial fears were valid, as I do still have days where I feel like I can't handle things, but overall we've adjusted quite nicely. Looking back now, I can't imagine the feeling of not wanting a third baby. She has been such an great addition to our family, and I love watching my boys interact with her. We are so lucky to have been blessed with this surprise daughter that we didn't know we wanted. Our family is finally complete.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL6UQLU8,,0.0,retold

I have two toddler boys, so I was terrified to have a third so close in age. While I usually love being pregnant, this one was a little harder on me both physically and mentally. I was constantly exhausted due to running around with a 3 year old and one year old every day. When I found out I was pregnant we had planned on waiting a few years before deciding if we wanted a third child, but we were very surprised when I got a positive pregnancy test.  It was a very trying pregnancy for me, and I spent most of my time panicking that I couldn't handle three kids. Everything changed when E was born. All of the things I had worried about wound up being much easier than expected. While things are a little more time consuming and difficult with three kids, I could not imagine life without her. Watching my sons interact with her, and seeing the love they have for her is such a blessing. Even though unplanned, I love having all my kids so close in age because then they will be able to play together as they grow older. My second child was a difficult baby, which was one of the reasons I was so scared to have another. So far, E has been the easiest baby. She sleeps decently,  and is content on her own most of the time. I am constantly amazed at how perfect her and my boys are, and am so thankful for how our family turned out.

That makes her zodiac sign the crab and mine the ram, not meant to get along without a lot of work, but we get along fantastic - so much for that. She speaks quite directly, and it's very relaxing and reassuring. Wasn't so direct about that crush for a few months, though. I'd first started talking to her because I admired her art, and she admired my writing - not that you'd know it from this kind of diary entry. Bit more comfortable with fiction I suppose. Anyway, we'd spent a few months chatting online, flirting a bit but ambiguously so, you know, like you could read more or less into it, whichever way you liked. Anyway, we'd both developed massive crushed on each other of the course of chatting - though she's told me since that she'd been pining a bit even before we started talking, that was cute - so it was nice to finally have that stated. Feelings mutual. And it's only been a couple months, and it's a long distance thing, but it's been working unbelievably well since then. All the little things, waking up to texted good-mornings and listening to her voice saying good night every night, chatting while we watch shows together, sorting out travel plans. Really quite remarkable given that she's ridiculously out of my league. Talented, thoughtful, gorgeous, ambitious, much smarter than I am - she's incredible.

These are character aspects that I have always struggled with; I always thought I needed to be someone else to enjoy life. But this encounter at the bar has revealed to me that that kind of thinking is poisonous to the mind and does me no good. So, having this encounter was good life lesson for me. This encounter said when me and a group of friends were at our favorite bar enjoying our time off work. During our drinking, a group of people came into the bar that we weren't familiar with, and one of them in that crowd was a beautiful woman that caught my attention. It seems that one of my friends caught me gawking, so to tease me, he got our group riled up have me take a dare to walk up to her and talk to her to get her phone number. I was usually highly resistant towards this goading, but it seems that the alcohol eases my inhibitions enough for me to take them on their dare. So, with a sense of confidence I rarely possess, I walked up to this woman and started talking to her. The conversation started off well enough. She and I were laughing and having a decent time. But, as the conversation went on, I found it harder and harder to convince her of the persona I initially presented to her. She picked up on that as well. He demeanor towards me went from pleasant to annoyed quickly. Eventually, she just said that I should go if All I did was lie to her. I was embarrassed and disappointed in myself, I started walking away. But something in me snapped. I turned around and when back to her. I told her who I really was and what I am really about. She appreciated that and agreed to let me continue to talk to her.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4QQXTKH,,0.0,retold

We decided to celebrate this occasion by going to one of our favorite bars in downtown Chicago. When we got there, the place wasn't packed too tightly (it was a Wednesday night after all). We sat at our favorite stall and ordered a round of drinks and a large plate of spicy chicken wings for us to gobble down. The atmosphere in the was relaxing, and things started smooth and relaxing. However, after several drinks we started proposing dares for us to do, and mine was one that started a chain of even I still remember today. One of my friends, let's call him Jim, dared for me to walk up to one of the women at the bar and ask her number. My friends knew I was single and that I was shy, so they knew I would be a nervous wreck going up to a woman and just start chatting with her. I tried to pass on this dare, but they wouldn't let this go, so to get them off my back, I decided to just do it and see what happens. So, I go up to, who I thought was the prettiest woman in the group, and just started talking to her, or at least I tried to. I was sweating, stumbling over my words, and I was, predictably, a nervous wreck. I tried my best to lead in the conversation, so I said any thing that popped in my head. I honestly wasn't thinking what I was saying; I just tried to hold on to dear life trying to find a way to ease out of this encounter as soon as possible. But something surprising happen that I didn't expect at all. The women who I was talking to clearly knew I was a wreck, but it didn't annoy her or piss her off. It seems that she picked up on the situation and started to lead the conversation instead. After she started stalking to me and calmed me down, our talk was rather pleasant. In fact, she said she found my nervousness with her rather cute. If I'd gone up to her all macho, she said she would have shut me down harshly in front of everyone. That I was 'real' with her and not trying to fake a persona was something she respected. After about another 15 minutes of talking, she thanked me about my honesty and she actually did give me her number. This encounter showed me that being myself in front of others isn't so bad at all and that I should be more confident in myself.",3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4QQXTKH,3STRJBFXOXDIB7Z058XH4MG4QQXTKH,0.0,recalled

Four months ago, I gave birth to my first child. I had a baby boy on June 5th. My husband and I decided to keep the sex a surprise, so we didn't find out that it was a boy until the birth. My husband thought it would be a boy, and I thought it would be a girl, so I was very surprised! The labor was extremely fast for being a first child and I almost didn't make it to the hospital in time. I started having contractions at home and my husband rushed me to the hospital. Unfortunately there was no time for an epidural so I felt everything! My sweet baby boy arrived a couple of hours after labor started. I will never forget the moment when they put him on my chest and I got to hold him for the first time. It transforms you. I have never felt that much love in my life. All in all it was a positive experience. Even though he came so quickly and I was in a lot of pain. The recovery went pretty well, and we were released from the hospital the next day. I love my baby boy so much.",,3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY16APYR9T,0.0,imagined

We both agreed that we did not want to get a brand-new puppy but go check out the shelter first. My husband went over at lunch and there he was - Max. My husband fell in love with him right away. He called me and told me i need to meet him. Later that day we went there again with the baby to see how the dog would be around the baby. It worked out great.  We made arrangements the same day to pick him up within a few days after he got snipped. So far so good we took him home only to find out he never seemed to have had any proper training. Now - about 10 Weeks later. He listens to us a lot better already but there is still so much to learn for him. He is a really good dog tho and i wouldn't want to miss him. At least we didn't have an incident of him jumping over the fence anymore like the first few weeks we had him.  He is really good with our Baby.

He is so loving and you can tell he is very thankful to be adopted from the shelter where he was as a stray. This event definitely changed our life for the better.  i really wouldn't want to miss him in our life now. One thing he still has to learn is not to chew up his toys completely. but i am sure he will get there and become a even better pet for us. Our other dogs are still not really sure what to do with their new friend since he is a lot bigger. They don't play with him but it will be alright.

I took the train because I'm not a big fan of flying anymore. And I figured it would give me a chance to see some beautiful landscape on the way. The train ride itself was pretty comfortable. I was lucky not to have to sit next to anyone, so that helped. But I was definitely happy to get off the train in Denver. The whole ride took about a full day. When I got to Denver, I had to kill a little time before I could check into my hotel, so I decided to walk from the train station. There was a bike/walking path going most of the way there. So it was a nice walk. The only downside was that it was a very hot day. So when I got to the hotel I was pretty sweaty. Once I settled into my hotel room and had a nice shower, I found a dispensary nearby that looked good and bought some edibles. It was my first experience with cannabis, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. The edible was probably too strong for me, and I felt like there was a big heavy blanket around my head. I remember trying to watch the news on TV and not being able to follow what they were talking about. Then I slept like a baby. The rest of the trip was full of typical tourist stuff. Then I took the train back, which was about 5 hours late getting into Chicago (that part sucked.)",3TMFV4NEP90Q8N1TRO5P11EC9X08WI,,0.0,retold

I took the train (because I'm not a big fan of flying) from Chicago to Denver which took about 20 hours. It was by far the longest I've ever spent on a train, and I was super happy to finally get off in Denver, but the ride wasn't so bad. It's way more comfortable than flying because the seats are bigger, with lots of legroom and you can get up to walk around. They even have an observation car with giant windows, although it was usually crowded. Nobody was sitting next to me, so I had tons of room. And there was free wi-fi, so I watched Netflix and did all the normal things on my computer that I would have done if I was at home. All in all it was a pleasant ride. When I got to Denver, I had a few hours to kill before I could check into my hotel room. So I decided I would walk the 5 miles from the train station to the hotel. There just happened to be a nice bike/walking path along a creek that covered most of the distance. It wasn't in a hurry and it was a hot day, so I took my time. I saw lots of breaks to sit and watch the cyclists and joggers pass by. When I finally got to the hotel, I was pretty sweaty and red in the face, and I still had a little more time to kill. So I found a bathroom and freshened up and relaxed in the lounge for a bit. Then I checked in and went to my room. From a quick internet search I saw that there were about 5 dispensaries all within walking distance from my hotel and I could see 3 of them from my room. So I picked the one that had the best reputation and went to buy legal cannabis for the first time. When you first walk into the dispensary, it looks like a boring waiting room. You give your ID to someone and then they buzz you into the main room where everything is for sale. Then you assigned a ""budtender"" who helps you choose what you want to buy.

I immediately accepted the job and headed for the Keys. I arrived in paradise and was amazed at the scenery. I spent a couple of days getting situated and then went to work. It was a mostly outside job and I enjoyed being in the environment and seeing all of the wildlife. I worked directly with guests vacationing in the keys and met many nice people. The lifestyle was so different anything I had ever experienced and was very enjoyable. I made many new friends and have stayed in contact with them. My wife and I would interact with co-workers during and outside of work. We were really able to experience the Keys to the fullest. We interacted with the community, enjoyed the food, experienced the night life and spent a fair amount of time on the water, fishing, boating, and scuba diving.

I accepted the job and began work shortly after arriving. I was impressed with the scenery and the wildlife in the area and I was exposed to this due to the fact that I worked outdoors. I was surrounded by a lot people all of the time. I made many new friends and made a lot of memories. I enjoyed time on the water, under the water and attended many social events. I was able to help with the social events by setting up and working booths, and helping people. I spent a lot of one on one time with new friends who were always good about seeing that I was enjoying myself and the environment. I enjoyed many boat rides and went scuba diving and fishing. Everyday brought new experiences. One day at the boat ramp I spotted a pelican standing in front of a truck that was pulling a boat out of the water. The truck driver seemed annoyed by the bird and was going to force it out of the way with his truck.  I walked right up to the bird and realized something was wrong with it. I carefully pick it up and moved it out of harms way. A couple of us then arranged for the wildlife department to pick the bird up and care for it. It was a very up close and personal experience. I would end most of my days in the Keys by watching the sunset. They were like none I had ever witnessed and I think they are one of the things I will miss them the most.",3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP93PE,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP93PE,0.0,recalled

I would consider an amusement park during a summer day significantly before making that decision again.  But again, it is not a day that I regret. The car ride was nice, no arguing! No trouble parking or being admitted into the park. The wait times for everything was reasonable. We rode everything we possibly could to make the most of the day. We ate well. We laughed, we talked, we just enjoyed everything we could while we were there. But at the end of they day, we were so tired. The feet hurt, had been hot all day, the a/c in the car felt so amazing.

Most in the family love roller coasters and like the thrill of those types of rides. It is just something we don't get to do very often.

There was a water park, but we didn't have time for that. It took the whole entire day, and we still didn't ride everything there. There were games, and though we tried, we did not win, go figure.

The last time I had a miniature dachshund was 5 years ago. My last puppy was 17 when she passed on. My son found the new puppy and paid 100 dollar deposit to hold her. We were so excited to welcome this new puppy.  The day finally came that we were going to drive down to get her. It was over 400 miles away that we were going to drive to get her. We got about 200 miles into our trip when the car broke down. We had to be towed back home. The car ended up being in the shop for over a week. We missed out on getting the puppy. My son had to forfeit his 100. dollar deposit. It was a very disappointing time. Happy news though we have found a new puppy only six miles away that we are getting in October.,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK,0.0,recalled

I never imagined that I would have a child and thought it wouldn't be possible. I was told there was a very small chance due to me having weak swimmers. This stems from the military and exposure I had while deployed. Of course, this would never be acknowledged by the military. So having my first child and thinking I wouldn't be able to have children was a miracle in itself. I guess there was one little strong one in the bunch. To make things even better is that we had a girl. In our family, we have not had a girl born into my family in over 3 generations. When we found out we were pregnant, we never imagined having a girl. Turns out that not only did we get pregnant, but we had a girl. I can't say enough about having a child other than how rewarding these past months have been. There have been many ups and downs, but in the end, it is amazing. I love my daughter so much and my wife just as much. No one can understand the love a parent has until they have a child. There is nothing that compares or comes close in this world. There is so much emotions bundled up and I am just so happy that we have her.

We then took the subway in to the heart of Paris.  As we stepped out in to the sunlight from underneath the ground, the first site we say was Notre Dame Cathedral in all of it's splendor.  My wife started crying and I was overwhelmed at the sites and sounds of Paris.  It is beautiful.  Little did we know that Notre Dame would be burning down a few days later.  The most memorable part of this experience happened inside of Notre Dame.  As we walked in, we realized a mass had just started.  We heard the most beautiful music.  We sat down and experienced the mass.  Since my wife knows French, she told me what the priest was saying.  It was a wonderful experience and we may have been in one of the last services before it burned.",3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS99Y7QCP,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS99Y7QCP,0.0,recalled

I woke my husband up and asked him to take me to the emergency room. Once we got there they ran many tests to find out why I was feeling the way I was. My blood sugar was very high, dangerously so. The doctor was surprised I wasn't in a diabetic coma. I was in the hospital for around 20 hours while they tried to determine if anything else was wrong with me. They were worried I might have had a stroke due to some of my symptoms. I had lots of blood work and a contract MRI done, as well as x-rays and cognitive tests. Once they were sure that I hadn't had a stroke they tried to bring my blood sugar down to a safe level. I was given multiple injections over several hours that failed to bring it down significantly. Finally it came down just barely into safe levels and they sent me home. Since that incident I have changed my life style. I've changed how I eat, started working out and running six days a week and lost forty pounds. I still have anxiety and fear associated with my health that I never experienced before going to the emergency room.",3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9ALWCQB,3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9ALWCQB,0.0,recalled

I can't explain what exactly was wrong, I now believe that I was having a panic attack. When I arrived at the hospital I told them that I was having chest pain and they did tests. They admitted me and did a lot of tests. They came back and told me my blood sugar was dangerously high, enough that I should be in a coma. I was diagnosed with diabetes. They kept me in the hospital the rest of the day and then released me with a lot of information and medications. I was emotionally very stressed out by the diagnosis. My mother has had diabetes most of my life and I have watched her health deteriorate. I visited my personal doctor a couple of days later and he had some recommendations. I completely changed what I ate, cutting out all foods that might have a negative impact on my blood sugar. I started running, six days a week for minimum half an hour, which I later increased to an hour. Over the next six months I lost about fifty pounds and was able to stabilize my blood sugar and stop taking insulin injections. I am healthier, physically, now, than I probably ever have been as an adult. Yet I started having severe panic attacks everyday that left me unable to do anything until they passed. Even when I wasn't having one the fear of having one was nearly as paralyzing. I pulled out of most of my social activities and quit my job. My health scare got me to take better care of myself but it also caused my mental and emotional state to deteriorate.",3TXMY6UCAFAN0TVKWRMOBYS9ALWCQB,,0.0,retold

It was something I thought he maybe didn't intent to happen so I talked to him about it, but he had a really defensive vibe when I brought it up to him.  He just kept going doing what he was doing even though it made me really uncomfortable.  The sex was really good, but he was just wouldn't listen to what I had to say.  After a couple of weeks I had really honestly had enough, he had asked me to go with him to pay off a parking ticket in another city and I was like cool this is lame.  Afterwards, we had dinner and I continued to express my concerns and he was like oh this is a loop and your feelings aren't important.  Prior I had directly told him that I can't do people that don't validate my feelings.  So, I was just like I am going to end this and I was sad.  Later he started messaging me and sending me apology letters and such, but it was like all on his terms and was creepy and controlling.  Like I met him in a coffee shop and he kept trying to lure me away from the coffee shop to see the moon or something.  I don't know, it was weird.

It was our ultimate break up that I am going to write about.  First, I met this guy when I was at a Meetup and he seemed super nice and kind and interested in me.  Well, I ended up reaching out to him and seeing if he wanted to get a cup of coffee.  When I reached out to him, he wanted to and so we met up and started talking.  I was really interested in him at first, but I've been hurt before so I had some guard up.  Well after a while, about 2 weeks of getting to know each other, he started imposing on my boundaries and being what I describe as controlling.  I asked him first for a little physical space, because he was all over me at first and it made me a little confused.  He wasn't super receptive to that and took it kind of like a personal slight.  Another thing I asked him, was when he was talking to ask me some questions and not just dominate the conversation.  Well his reaction to that was that I should just interrupt him if I had something to say and he started to call me stupid.  I was more and more frustrated with him and he began pressuring me more and more to do things his way and without my input.  It made me very upset and I decided that I wanted to end it.  He got really upset and said that I was just labeling him and not being kind enough to him, he didn't mean to push my boundaries, how do you know unless you try he kept saying.  In my head it was confusing, because a lot of my relationships in the past had been unhealthy,  and I am just learning healthy ones.  So, it turns out he wrote to me and tried very hard to get me to get back together with him.  But, I don't want to be with him, he makes me feel stressed out and tired and I am glad I got out of that relationship.",3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862FL3S9B,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862FL3S9B,0.0,recalled

He is stable and a good communicator.  He also happened to be a musician and owns a ginseng farm on the side of doing executive financial work as a day job.  The job explained his aesthetic and I got plants and music and dive bars in his interests too.  I am very lucky that he is quite taken with me as well.  He inspires me to be a better person.

I met him through Tinder and from what I could see from his profile pictures, we seemed to be very different.  But I thought he was good looking so I swiped right, and it turns out he had swiped right on me too.  When he started messaging me I was surprised to see how much we really had in common.  We both play a lot of instruments and had similar conversation style, and he was very intelligent.  When I showed up to meet him for the first time, he was dressed in dress khakis and very clean cut.  I am more of a black nail polish and flannels type of girl.  He has a job as a financial analyst and I am a freelancer.  When I started talking to him it turns out we have the same views about spirituality, had very similar childhoods, had the same passions and interests all around.  I really learned I shouldn't judge a book by it's cover.  I was wrong in my assumption of his personality based on his style of dress.  I brought that up and he mentioned that he has had to adapt to being clean cut for his job.  We had a really good time and I have seen him since.  It was really nice to find someone that I am so in-tune with and I hope it works out.

She was about 14 and was part Lab. She had some of the breathing problems that Labs are prone to have where their lungs can't get the amount of oxygen as they need. She was the third family dog that we had had from a puppy until death. Ghost, our first, lived 17 years. Casper, our 2nd, lasted 15 years. So, after being with them for so many years, we get quite attached to them. Cheebs had been going downhill for several years and there was nothing the vets could really do anymore to relieve her problem. So, it was up to us to decide if the joy of having her around us and her joy of being around us was better for her than suffering thru the medical condition. Finally, it got to the point where we decided it was no longer fair to her, that she was suffering too much. So, my wife and I agreed and our oldest son concurred that it was time. We took her out to the car and helped her get in the back seat. She knew that she was going to the Vets as that was the only time she got to ride. We had called our Vet ahead so they were waiting on us. I got to the vet and my wife went in and told them that we were here. I tearfully walked her through the parking lot and we went in and back to the room. She was very calm, almost like she knew what was up. It only took a few minutes for the drug to act and she calmly and peacefully looked at me until her eyes closed. I loved her and miss her dearly.",3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZX0WW,,0.0,retold

Today was a very emotional day. I had to have our old dog put down. She was a big sweetie. We (my wife and I) have had several dogs over the years. We get quite attached to them and they have always lived a long time. Ghost was 17, Casper was 16, and now Cheeba, who was 13. I will miss Cheebs, as I called her, as I feel this may be the last dog that my wife and I get as we are getting up in years ourselves. Cheeba was having respiratory problems that have been getting worse and worse until some days she could hardly catch her breath. Her appetite was about gone except for special meals that I would fix her. Cheebs was a great dog- lots of intense love went both ways. We had had her since she was a very young puppy. She was very protective of our family, but not mean at all. So, today has been one of the worst days of my life. We agreed that she was suffering and no way to get better and we were just being selfish, so we decided today would be it. We called our Vet who had been expecting this call. He told us to come on and with a heavy leaden heart, we got her into the car. She liked car rides and didn't mind the vet as she'd known the same one all her life. We both got out of the car with tears in our eyes and let her pee on the grass and then took her inside. They were ready for us and  we put her on the table and got her calm and said our good-byes. It was almost like she looked at me with understanding and was okay about it. We stayed with her and the Vet injected her with the drug. After a few seconds, her eyes closed and she went unconscious and died almost immediately. We felt about as bad as one can and I hope she is waiting for me when I have my last journey too.",3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZX0WW,,0.0,recalled

But a note in your birthday card is up there with really bad ways to find out. Especially when it arrives the day before your birthday and you had big plans. A trip out of time, tickets to a concert and nice hotel room suddenly seemed about as appealing as a plate of rotten fish. My Mom has always been there for me through all my mistakes and failures. Always trying to help, although never really having the right words. But just knowing that at least one person was one my side was usually enough to get me through to the next thing. The card and the note hit me like a train. It didn't really say how serious or treatable the cancer might be. So I was left wondering about her health as I  broke the news to my friend going with me that the trip was off. Although I live a short distance from my parents, I don't go over there anymore because of my father being such a jerk. I got tired of the fighting and insults and vowed to never set foot there again. My brother had wisely made the decision 25 years earlier, so I knew he would have no info either. I was filled with dread and fear as I picked up the phone to call.  They say no news is good news, but not so much when it's your Mom's health. Of course my call goes to voicemail, which further increases my anxiety. The next day my Mom calls me back to say that she has a tumor but they think they will be able to operate and remove it. Fortunately they don't find any cancer in the bloodstream or lymph nodes. Having been through a breast cancer scare with my best friend a year early I knew this was a good sign. Yet still I was mostly paralyzed with a foreboding sense of doom and a real trepidation that my biggest supporter in life might not be around too much longer. As each day ticked off until the operation I could barely think of anything else and could barely get any work done. When it was over, the doctors said that they were very successful in getting the tumor out, and they had no concern that it had spread but chemo would still be necessary.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ3U3NRW,0.0,recalled

I knew my family would show up for sure so it wasn't too big of a deal. The big day comes and just a handful of my husband and I's family shows up and no friends of ours. We were crushed.

I think our average age is only 22 years old!  I knew something was happening when my boss asked me to come into his office. Once I got in there he had a big smurk on his face, so I knew then it must be good.  He immediately told me that we exceeded our goal by 25%, and that our salaries would be increasing as a result. I've worked so hard the past year to make this goal happen, I'm thrilled that its finally actually happening. With all the extra money I'll be making, I can now pay off my student loans that much faster. It's been quite a struggle the past 12 months paying my regular bills and my student loans. Now that I'll have this extra income, I may even have a little left for some fun entertainment after work some nights. After I left the office, my other 4 co-workers were watching me.

We waited a bit before we got news that the baby was born, I was so excited to have another nephew. Everyone took turns visiting the baby and the parents. I waited a bit before going to visit because I was going to be staying a little longer than everyone else, so I took a little nap while waiting to see the baby. I remember my mom waking me up and I felt like I had been sleeping for hours but it had only been around 30 minutes or so. So I went to see my sister in law, brother and my new nephew after most people had left. It was really nice to be able to hold him and look at him after waiting for him to be born all of these months. I went home soon after because I was really tired.

While there her she started to go into labor. I was so nervous and didn't know what to do at the time people I had never been present when my sister or her had went into labor. So I drove her to the hospital and on the way was trying to get in contact with my brother. I was with her for about 30 minutes before he showed up at the hospital. I already have several nieces and nephews but this was the first time I had actually had to drive one of them to the hospital, I always used to come after the baby was born. I waited around for a couple of hours waiting for the birth of my new nephew. He was finally born and I was so happy to see him, healthy and see that my sister in law was fine as well. A lot of our family came to the hospital to visit the baby and the parents. It was nice to see some of the family because I hadn't seen some of them in months. I spent some time there talking with family members and sharing stories about what had happened lately in my life. It was just a good experience overall and I was so happy that I was there at the time and was able to drive her to the hospital. I left hours later and was so tired because I had been there for over six hours. When I got home I took a shower and ate something. I then got into bed and went to sleep because I had work the next day.",3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA84FHUXZ,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA84FHUXZ,0.0,recalled

After the wedding we all headed to the reception to enjoy some good food and entertainment. My cousin however wasn't so happy when the caterers brought the food and cake out. It was a disaster. They totally screwed up the menu, it was like they got another wedding order mixed up with my cousins. There wasn't one thing on the menu that she had ordered. The cake was the same way, it wasn't even close to what she wanted and she was obviously upset in the wedding photos. She finally got over it and the fun started, the food turned out to be very tasty so all ended well. We danced until we were bone tired. The band was excellent and everybody said they enjoyed the music. After the night was over and everybody was ready to go home the couple got in the car and left.

I live several hours from my parents and siblings so we only see each other a couple times a year. It was my niece's birthday and also near the 4th of July so it was a good time to take a trip back home to see everyone. I spent the night before my drive taking care of errands around my apartment and then packing for the trip. The next afternoon, I left work a bit early and started the drive back to my parents' place. I arrived a couple hours of driving to find my brother had already arrived. I pulled into the driveway, shut off my car and got my suitcase out of the car and walked up to the front door. The front door was locked so I went around to the garage door and was going to use the keypad to open it when the front door opened and my dad was there. I smiled and gave him a hug as I walked into the house. I saw my mom and brother talking in the kitchen so I dropped my stuff off on the ground and went over to say hi. After a brief round of greetings, I went back to put my stuff into a spare bedroom where I would be spending the next two nights. I put my stuff in the room and headed back downstairs after plugging my phone into the wall to start charging. I got back downstairs and saw my parents and brother were discussing dinner options. We were going to meet my sister and her kids at a local restaurant for dinner and we were trying to figure out a time that worked. My sister mentioned a time she was available and we headed out to the restaurant to see everyone. We showed up a bit early, but after about 5 minutes my sister pulled in with her kids. I said hi to my nieces and nephew before giving my sister a hug and we walked in to get some food. We ordered our food and sat down at a table and had a good time reminiscing about old times and talking about how our lives were currently. We ate some delicious food and had an overall good time. After about an hour my sister needed to put the kids to bed so we went our separate ways. It was great getting to see everyone again and it was a wonderful night.",3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJESFZUT,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJESFZUT,0.0,recalled

The only thing i did was go to a store and ask a question. Not knowing the odds she would answer yes that she will help me. It may have taken weeks for a reply back form her. But when she called we didn't instantly connected the conversation was scattered at times. Then all of sudden she needed my help, that caused a door to be opened for me to gain guidance from her through couponing. She taught me how to shop and how to coupon within different stores. In my helping her she wasn't selfish in her giving and I was accomplishing more in saving then I even have. Also, the friendship we built was even better than ever. I was able get my head above water with her help and she gain a helpful friend.

Now I have a 3 month old.  I went into the doctor because I was having back pain. They decided to keep me overnight just to be cautious. When I woke up in the morning they told me I was in labor. I couldnt believe it. I spent the whole day in mild discomfort and after 26 hours i was ready to deliver. I was surprised to deliver a healthy baby boy at 6 lbs 1 oz. I didnt know my little man was ready to come out. My husband couldnt believe it either. We had to quick buy more baby equipment as we werent quite prepared a month out. Being a mother is hard work but overall rewarding. I am not getting a lot of sleep and feel a bit disjointed but we are doing our best. We will love our son every day of our lives. I still cant believe that his happened so early!,,3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ5SD7A0,0.0,imagined

They were going to check on me via ultrasound.  As they began the ultrasound the nurse noticed that my fluids - the amniotic fluids my son was living in - were looking low.  She took the proper measurements and excused herself to make a call.  For days I had felt I was leaking amniotic fluid but doctors and nurses who I remarked this too just laughed.  They chalked it up to the over imagination of a pregnant woman 5 days past her due date.  Nonetheless, since 5 days had passed and still no baby they brought me in for a routine exam.  When the nurse came back into the room she announced that she had spoken with my midwife and that the news she was going to deliver ""probably isn't going to come as a surprise but the midwife wants to keep you overnight.""  It was a surprise.  I was at the hospital with my daughter and husband and we didn't have anything packed or ready.  Regardless, I was ushered upstairs to a room and put into a hospital gown while my husband and daughter rushed home to grab supplies and our overnight bag - prepared months in advance.  When they returned, the doctors had already started me on the medicines necessary to start induction.  It was time to have this baby!  While this took me completely by surprise, I can't say I wasn't a little bit anxious.  After all, he was supposed to have been born almost a week prior!  A little over 8 hours later at 3:30 in the morning my son came into the world - late, unexpected, and with a little help from several kinds of medicine!",3UXUOQ9OKFJP1WT7GEHR5CLQ5SD7A0,,0.0,retold

The waiting room of the ultrasound department was always busy - lots of women and men waiting to be seen and wait times upwards of an hour and a half.  My appointment had been scheduled for 3 but it was nearly 5 pm when I was finally called in.  They dimmed the lights in the exam room and proceeded to take measurements.  The nurse remarked that my amniotic fluids looked a bit low.  Otherwise, the  baby looked well.  She said she would call my midwives and see what they wanted to do.  She was gone for sometime and when she came back she told me that they wanted to induce me and that I was likely not shocked.  She was wrong.  I was not expecting to be induced and I was not expecting to stay at the hospital that very day.  They whisked my away to another room and began to process the admittance forms.

Now, I was about to send him off into and environment where I would not be. I had to trust that he was adult enough to handle these things on his own. My anxiety and worry began a few months before he even left. Daily I would imagine some horrible scenario he might face. I dreaded moving day. Inevitably, moving day arrived and we packed the car and drove to his new life. As I left him in that strange city on his own for the first time I was filled with sadness and worry. Day after day he persisted on. He rarely called each week even though I reached out daily. Each time I talked to him he confidently exclaimed to me that he was doing just fine and having a great time. He was living his life and doing it on his own. He was fine. I did my job and raised him to function and succeed in a world that was often difficult for him. When summer came, he decided to stay in the city to work and continue to live his independent life.

He was preparing to move to a city that was about 100 miles away from where we live. This was the first time he was to be away from home and on his own. Because my son has Asperger's syndrome, I have spent my whole life advocating for and protecting him. As I prepared him to leave, I realized that I would no longer have any any control over that anymore. As a last ditch effort to be useful, I took him shopping and bought him all that I thought he would need to be prepared to be on his own. I also took a lot of time to explain to him things he would have to remember to do and take care of. I was anxiety ridden and I thought about how he would get along without me. I worried that something bad would happen to him. The night before he left, I could not sleep. That morning, I tried to hold back tears as we packed up all his belongings into my car and prepared for the trip. The whole drive I lectured him on safety. I know that he got tired of listening to me and I worried he tuned out. I reminded him of the importance of keeping clean and respecting his roommates.  When we pulled up to his new apartment, I put on a smile and brave face even though I was torn to pieces on the inside. My stress levels were through the roof even as his excitement was abounding. We moved him in and he was in a hurry to rush me out the door so that he could begin his solo journey. I was totally crushed. I sobbed as I gave him a hug and told him how much I loved him and would miss him. I got back in my car and cried the whole way home. I cried for the next few days. I still worry every single day about him and his safety.",3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCHZD23K,3V5Q80FXIYDIVAXG1NLMMDQCHZD23K,0.0,recalled

They loved it! They each went on a few rides and met LOTS of characters. They were especially starstruck when they met Big Bird and Elmo. My oldest son was pretty afraid of the big characters but that soon turned to delight. He just needed a bit to warm up. The best part was the parade where you get to see all the characters at once. The music is so fun and it's just an incredible experience. To our surprise, Elmo pulled my oldest son out of the parade which was so exciting. I'll never forget when he grabbed his hand! I will always cherish the wonder and awe my kids experienced at this place. A perfect place for their ages!",3VE8AYVF8NJOX1FY1ZVPXDSC4YT8F1,,0.0,retold

We left for the night and had sent several text messages through the evening. Upon waking up on Tuesday I noticed that there were strange posts on her Facebook from other people, but nothing specific. I readied myself for work and made the 45 minute commute. As soon as I got in the office people were giving me weird looks and I knew something was up. I casually asked if she had called in already since her car was not in the lot. My boss, who is a very no nonsense man asked me to come into his office. I thought I was being fired or something. As soon as the door was shut behind me, he simply said xxx is dead, sorry. Those were his exact words. I thought he was kidding, and sat there in shock for several seconds before he asked me if I was ok. No I am not ok. I have to find out from you of all people, and how you tell me is simply she's dead, sorry? He would not let me leave work, so I called my husband to drive up and literally take me home.

We were very close and her death was extremely unexpected. After a vacation was supposed to be back at work on Monday morning. Upon arriving at work, my boss brought me into the office. He told me she had passed away in her sleep the prior night. My heart dropped. How could this have happened to a healthy 42 year old? Why was I hearing about this from my boss? I actually did not believe him, and wondered why he was doing this to me? I had just talked to her yesterday! Losing her rocked my world. I was lost. I could not function at work or home. My kids were upset, she was like an aunt to them. It was honestly one of the worst things I ever went through. One of the worst things for me was how I learned about her passing. I was so hurt that her family did not call me. I just didn't understand how someone who was like a sister to me could just be gone, and I had to find out by my boss. Since she was so young, they did not release her body for burial until 2 weeks later. Her husband held the funeral a week later. It has been a very difficult month since the funeral. I often pick up my phone to call or text her. I have read through our text messages so many times that I have them memorized.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDAD3TOX,3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDAD3TOX,0.0,recalled

This is not our first child but this pregnancy and deliver were definitely some of the most challenging and difficult. My wife had been in and out of the hospital for monitoring over the prior two weeks due to hyper tension and worries of preeclampsia. This last time she was admitted they decided that they needed to keep her for monitoring. While she was having normal contractions it was noted that our babies hear rate would dip dangerously low with each contraction. This, they suspected, was because the umbilical cord was wrapped around the babies neck. The contractions were tightening the cord and cutting off some of her air supply. They decided they needed to induce right away. My wife was trying to push the baby out but was having great difficulty and everything was made even more difficult because of the babies heart rate dropping with every attempt. The doctor was getting frustrated and worried that she would not be able to deliver normally and had them prep the OR for an emergency C-section. My wife was adamant that she didn't want a C-section, but the doctor told her they would have to do what is in her and the babies best interests. He then said she had a few more minutes to try herself, and that she really needed to focus. At this point, my wife really tried and after a couple pushes, and some pulling from the doctor with a suction cup, the babies head was visible. The doctor quickly unwrapped the umbilical cord from around the babies neck and my wife finished the delivery of our little girl. The entire labor and delivery process took 45 minutes from start to finish. This was one of the most exciting, scary, happy, and stressful situations in my entire life. I can only imagine how intense it all must have been for my wife.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,0.0,recalled

I decided to visit my friend who owns a jewelry store and selected the perfect ring. It was a little over 2 carats but worth every cent. When we arrived in Louisville we checked into our hotel room and then had dinner at Jeff Ruby's Steak House. The meal was delicious and the view was even better. We decide to walk next door to the performing arts center and have a few cocktails before the show. We took our seats in a private balcony and when the first half was over the magic began. I got down on my knee and proposed to my future wife. She cried and I let a few tears slip myself. The crowd began clapping when they realized what was happening and it was the perfect moment.

I haven't seen him in about 20 years.  He told me that he was going to be coming back to his hometown.  Hes in the military so he bounces around the world and is never really in one place.  He asked if we could meet up and I agreed.  About a week later he called me again and told me he was in town.  So we scheduled up somewhere to meet.  When we finally got together we really hit it off.  It was great to relive our old memories and tell each other where we were in life now.  I didn't even know he had kids and a family.  We promised to keep in contact with each other from here on out.  He even invited me to come out and visit him sometime, as hes a bit more stable now since hes close to retiring from the military.  I'm really looking forward to going out to visit him.  I'm glad that he reached out to me.

She had had knee surgery in the past and was unable to make it to the top due to her knee pain.  WE were determined we were going to make it this time.  WE started at around 8:00 am that morning.  Although it was very hard because it was up hill the whole way I made it to the top.  Two of our party did not make it to the top but tried their best.  Of the ones who made it, it took us 4 hours to make it all the way to the top.  We were exahausted but elated we had reached our goal!  The way down didn't take nearly as long because it was mostly down hill.  It took about 2 and a half hours to make the journey back to our car.  On our way back down we met up with the two in our party who did not make it to the top although they had made great progress.  They were disappointed and vowed to make it to the top the next time we went.  I really enjoyed our hiking expeirence although it was very taxing.

We had been hiking a lot over the past few months and decided to tackle Mt. Leconte via Alum Trail.  It's an 11 mile round trip hike with a 16.53 trail rating which is considered strenuous.  We started of on our hike with myself, my sister, brother, husband, daughter, niece and brother in law.  My brother in law was the first to stop as it was uphill most of the way.  My daughter who has had knee surgery was next to go down and my husband stayed back with her.  We ended up only going to he top of the Alum Cave trail because it was another 5.5 miles to the top and we couldn't not in good conciense make our hiking companions wait on us to complete the entire hike.  Fast foward two years later.  We have again made a trip to the Smokies and are determined to make it to the top.  My hiking companions this time are the same minus my daughter.  We had not been hiking as much this year and are not in as good a shape as we were on our last attempt.  The path is much more strenuous this time and by the time we make it to Alum cave we are wiped but determined to continue.  We are already down one hiking companion, my brother in law, but he told us to go on without him.  As we continue myself, niece and husband pull away from my sister and brother.  As they continue it becomes to strenous for my brother and he has to abandon the hike.  My sister ends up catching up with us as I have really slowed down as it is a straight up hike now.  We are all struggling but are dertemined to make it to the top.  As we round the last bend in the trail and see the top we are overjoyed!  We made it!  At the top is a lodge and we deicde to go in the gift shop and purchase a shirt to proudly display our accomplishment.  As we head down we meet up with my brother first who was not faring well he had run out of water.  We share our water and continue down.   As we near the bottom we see my brother in law waiting for us.  We have decided to return in a couple years and see if we can all make it to the top.",3WJEQKOXA9OBQAE5RY0I42UD0PBA14,,0.0,retold

It was December of 2018 and it was the year I got married. The time leading up to this event seemed to fly by fast. From the planning stages to the picking out of the venue and all the extras that come along with it. In my mind I figured this would feel like a drawn out process. However, looking back, it seemed like it flew by in the blink of an eye. What seemed like a point where we would have all the time in the world to plan and prep for everything we needed turned into a few last minute wants and needs that were taken care of only days before. I think most people were worried about the weather since it took place on December 15th. Chicago area weather is unpredictable, especially during the winter so it would be a game day decision on how things would go down. The day however, ended up being quite nice and the weather was unseasonably warmer than usual. Everything went off without a hitch and like the previous months of planning, the day seemed to be over in a blink of an eye. No major issues arose and everyone and everything was where it needed to be when needed. I think the biggest issue to arise was that someone twisted their ankle on the dance floor. In my book, if that is the worst thing to happen then that is a positive. The night ended, and all I remember is being exhausted from running around and entertaining guests and other family. I barely even had a chance to take a shot with family and friends to celebrate!",3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RM04VH26,3WLEIWSYHP3XPI4FG8AOQ7RM04VH26,0.0,recalled

I couldn't afford to run my AC constantly at that time (and even if I could afford to I shouldn't have), so sometimes I would just do walking meditation in my house to take my mind off the heat. It certainly didn't help with the whole being hot situation, but at least it was distracting for bit. Anyway, one evening after having dinner I decided to go do some walking up and down the little hallway I have in my house. It's one of the only parts of my house where I can do walking meditation properly. I can't remember if I was listening to a Dhamma talk at the time, but more than likely I was. I had my hands resting in front of me, right hand around left wrist, with my hands just freely hanging/resting around where my dick is. My eyes were gazing down and a few feet in front of me, so I wouldn't get distracted by my surroundings. It was probably 15 minutes or so into the walking meditation that I noticed my mind starting to settle down. There were still thoughts and mental movement here and there, but it was substantially less than usual. Around this time or maybe a little bit after a great sense of calm and peacefulness came over me. My breathing had become more subtle and my thoughts weren't as numerous or enthralling. This sense of calm didn't end with my walking meditation though. I can't entirely remember how long it lasted, but I'd say it was still around at least 15 minutes or so after I had finished walking.  I've had some similar experiences since then, but it doesn't always happen to that extent.",3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC,,0.0,retold

This of course leads to its own types of pain, but they're more manageable. Anyway, recently I had been doing my walking meditation as usual. I like to do an hour a day whenever I can since I work from home and can leave my computer for short times here and there. I usually break this down into 10-15 minute sessions just to make it easier to get the practice in without disturbing my work day too much. One late afternoon/early evening I was doing my walking and reached a very peaceful and tranquil state. My mind was significantly more quiet than it usually is, although there were still thoughts bubbling up here and there. I also realized at the time that the movement in my mind was starting to slow down. My mind was no longer jumping from one thought to another endlessly. This mental state continued for a few minutes as I continued to pace back and forth on my walking path and just observed it. After I finished that feeling of peace and tranquility lingered for a while before fading away. I've had some pretty strange and interesting experiences so far while exploring these different techniques. The stillness I felt during this particular session really stood out to me though.",3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC,3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC,0.0,recalled

Leading up to the appointment, my mother had been getting quite a lot of uncertain information. She started out with a soreness in her throat, but the initial tests she went through didn't find anything. Then some nodes started to develop on her neck, and she went in for a biopsy to find out what they were. They found thyroid cancer. So, she was called in for further scans (I apologize, but I can't remember exactly what kind now) and the diagnosis quickly escalated from a fairly treatable version present in her thyroid and surrounding lymph nodes to a rapidly growing tumor that was threatening her airway. That was when the meeting that I described came in. The scans happened on that Monday, and on Friday we were sitting in a doctors' office with so many specialists there that they couldn't all fit into the room. My father and I went with her to the appointment knowing generally what we were going to hear. We had a little trouble finding the right place to go, but we still got there early. A nurse took some readings first while we waited. Then a doctor came in and started going over the past events with her to make sure that they had everything right. My father and I sat off to the side mostly for moral support but also to take notes and chime in with questions, reminders, or clarifications. There was a knock on the door, and quite a few doctors filed in. They milled about a little trying to find places to stand without crowding anyone. Then they introduced themselves and their specialties explaining how they might be involved in the process ahead. They explained what they had seen and what it meant too. One doctor set up a camera to go into her nasal cavity so they could observe the tumor breaking into her airway in real time. They talked amongst themselves and explained to us what they were seeing. Another doctor did a quick swallow study having my mother do some vocal exercises and swallow water and applesauce to see what would happen. Eventually most of the doctors filed out except the radiologist who introduced herself. She explained that she would be leading the radiation treatment which was the first step, and we learned what that would involve. Finally, a different nurse responsible for coordinating the doctors came in and introduced herself. That was it for that day",3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K3132N6YF,,0.0,retold

My mother has been experiencing difficulty swallowing and shortness of breath for a few weeks now, and from some testing done since then doctors concluded that it was probably thyroid cancer. On Monday, she got an MRI (I think that's what it was) that gave the doctors a much clearer picture of what was going on. Anyway, they called her in for a consultation on Friday, and I went along just to provide support. After a little bit of bouncing around trying to find the right place (it was a new hospital), we were brought to a patient waiting room. A nurse took some preliminary readings and then left. Then a doctor came in to get an overview of events from my mother. I was there to add any details she'd missed, but I ended up not needing to. I mostly just sat in the corner and nodded. Anyway, before she had finished there was a knock on the door, and moments later there were about 10 people coming into the room - mostly doctors and a few nurses. They were all different specialties (radiation, chemotherapy, recovery therapy, etc.) but focused on throat and neck diseases. At this point, the room was fairly crowded so I was definitely aware of my position off in the corner. I was just trying to stay out of the way now. They ran a small camera into her nostril to check out the vocal cords. While it was in there, they asked her to do a few breathing/vocal exercises and to swallow water/applesauce. It was sort of hard to watch. It seemed like they spotted what they thought they'd seen because after a few seconds of recovery they began walking her through what they were thinking. Apparently the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes and lungs and was continuing to grow fast. I won't focus on the details here, but the plan was about two weeks of radiation as soon as possible and chemotherapy from there. The overall outlook looks very poor. Like I said, this was not information thrown at us all at once right then and there. The picture was revealed throughout the week via correspondence and examiner's reactions. Still, this was everything being laid out for sure. It was a moment of clarity I guess you could say. Then the doctors all explained how they would be involved in the process and introduced themselves and left for now - I'll end the story here because I'm getting the warning",3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K3132N6YF,3WYP994K18D7TED5DAQF2K3132N6YF,0.0,recalled

Her older sister and cousin were both running around the splash pad having a great time while the adults sat under an umbrella.  Her uncle was snoozing on the ground and she pushed herself off his chest to a standing position from the ground and looked at me.  She took three deliberate steps toward me and I lost my mind.  My father saw it as well and he was overly excited as well.  We were both laughing happily and making a fuss over her.  We woke up her uncle who was snoozing on the ground and exclaimed how amazing it was to just have witnessed such an amazing thing.  My mom and sister both missed seeing the milestone in her life but were both delighted to have been there when she accomplished something so amazing. At that moment, I was such a proud mommy.  Being a mother and witnessing these beautiful little babies accomplish any milestone is one of the best feelings a person can experience.  I'm so proud of both of my little girls.

She has become an integral part of our family and is becoming a little bit more of a little human every day.  She started crawling at seven months and got her front teeth at eight months.  She's been teething a grumpy recently, but is still as cute as a button no matter how hard she cries.  We typically go out to eat with my parents and sister on Saturdays.  We bring her daughter, Dalyla, and Lily's big sister, Evelyn.  They're typically little terrors as they're age three and four; still adorable though.  I can't imagine life without these little brats.  On this particular Saturday, we chose to go to the park after we ate at a local Italian restaurant.  There is a splash pad at this park and it's a hot day so the cold water is very welcome.  Lilian is wearing her cute little pink, flowery bikini and is standing next to grandpa.  She looks me directly in the face and takes three deliberate steps toward me.  I scream in delight and scare the begeezus out of her uncle, who also came with us to the park today.  My father and I are laughing and declaring our pride.  She took her first steps!  We witnessed her first steps!  No one could be prouder at that moment.  No matter how many children I choose to have, there will never be a prouder moment than when one of them completes a milestone for the first time.

The party was for one of her school friend's that I had never met. Her name is Ashley, and she is really into Disney Princesses. The invitation said that the guests were encouraged to dress as their favorite princess. My daughter has never really been into princesses, but she does enjoy the Disney movies. She selected to dress up as Jasmine from Aladdin because she liked the outfit.  When we got to the party, there were a bunch of girls dressed as princesses playing princess themed yard games. My daughter said hello to the birthday girl and joined in the games. I walked over to the group of parents standing by the refreshment area to introduce myself. The birthday girl's mom, whose name is Sheila, welcomed me and told me that cake would be soon because it was a special surprise cake. About 30 minutes later, Sheila called everyone to come gather around the refreshment area. When everyone was gathered and silently waiting, Sheila yelled, ""Okay, cake, come on out!"" Out walked the most beautiful Princess Belle that I had ever seen. She was gorgeous, and wearing the most stunning yellow dress, just like in the movie. Sheila walked up to her with a knife and stabbed the dress while everyone gasped in horror. Sheila and Belle looked at each other and laughed, the dress was the cake! I had never seen anything like it, not even on the cake making shows on television. It was mind blowing. Belle stood still while Sheila cut everyone a piece of the dress cake. I doubted that it would taste very good, thinking that there must be a trade off for the amazing appearance of the cake. I was wrong, the cake was delicious, probably the best I have ever tasted.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXEAQMTBQ,0.0,imagined

It kind of turns out that it is, more or less, just a desk job. Albeit, a very stinky desk job. The workers come in, have a stack of work in front of them for the day, and pretty much just work on that at their desk. Because of this, it is kind of my least favorite part of the lab. The other departments involve quite a bit more moving around and multitasking. I have worked plenty of desk jobs in the past, and don't have much desire to continue to do so any more. I'd rather have a job that's a little more fast paced and active. Luckily, it looks like the profession that I'm choosing has a little bit of both.

I am enrolled in a Medical Lab Tech program at a college. I have already finished the core class requirements for the program, and am now engaging in clinical rotations. These rotations take place at local hospitals. I essentially go in, as if I am a regular employee, and learn how to do the job with other working employees. Unfortunately, there is no pay for this, but the idea is that the experience will pay for itself. Once of the classes I had to take was Microbiology. The class itself was tough, and a little confusing. It was essentially a long list of organisms, and the media that is used to grow the organisms. So, a lot of memorization. Now, and for the past six weeks or so, I have been doing my clinical rotation in the Microbiology department. The surprising thing that I have found is that the job itself isn't nearly as confusing as the class led me to believe that it would be. Granted, there is a massive amount of knowledge that is required to be known, but there are tons of reference materials at hand, and the use of them is heavily encouraged. The job is basically a desk job. I did not expect that. The employees in the Microbiology department work at one of six stations. The stations determine the type of work that will be performed for that day. The work that they will be doing for the day is laid out in front of them at the beginning of the shift, and once it is completed, they are basically finished working for the day, and just do extra things until the shift ends.

We got a series of cupcakes instead of a large wedding cake. The flavors were orange chiffon, Italian ribbon, chocolate chocolate chip, and milk and cookies. We spent hours socializing before going back home for the night. We stayed up until about one in the morning. It was great snuggling up in bed with him for the first time.

I was given the raise because I had been accountable to two donors at the private school I work at. These donors reached out to administration to offer me a ten percent raise. I was not expecting this and was not only flattered but completely surprised. It made me feel proud of my accomplishment of reaching out to these donors to let them know where and how the money they donated to the library I manage was being spent. I plan on using the money to pay off a car loan I recently got. What I did to get the raise was to write monthly reports. In the reports I put what we spent the money on. I also put what student engagement was happening because of the monetary gift. Student engagement is very important to these donors. They liked hearing that students used their gift appropriately. They also liked seeing images of the students using items bought with the gift. At the end of the year I sent the donors a comprehensive report. In the report were statistics about student engagement. I also had photos in the report. The report also contained information on how we will be using the items bought with the donation. I think the donors were pleased with the way I reported on their monetary gift.,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWAOIL8J,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWAOIL8J,0.0,recalled

I often thought I knew what love was. I had no idea what either were until I looked into my daughter's eyes for the very first time.

When it was nearly time, the doctor told me to look and there she was, my wife was delivering a perfect, beautiful baby girl. As I nervously cut the umbilical cord, my daughter opened her eyes to look at me. In that instance, I knew what happiness and love was. A few moments later, as I sat with my wife and daughter, my heart nearly exploded for both of them. I couldn't believe that my wife had just gone through the most painful event ever to give me this perfect baby. Over the course of the last few months, my love and happiness has grown each day even through sleep deprivation. My wife and I are truly a team when it comes to this child-rearing business but I am not arrogant enough to think we have it all figured out.

It's totally hard to believe that we created this perfect, little human. I am sure there are trials and tribulations to come but. for right now, I am simply enjoying these moments.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HZPMWRG,0.0,imagined

Once we got there we went around and explored the first city. It was pretty, if a bit crowded. We ate some ice cream and then decided on going to see some llamas. We took a bus ride to the llama farm and went in to see them. They were incredibly adorable, though I was expecting that. My friend and his girlfriend ended up buying a couple of shirts for themselves to commemorate the occasion. We headed back into to town to get something to eat before heading to the beach. We ended up getting some extremely good fish and chips at a pretty good restaurant. It was kind of overpriced but what ever. After this we headed over to the beach to get some sun.

I'd been working 50-55 hour weeks for the last three months. It was my fault too. I kept asking for more responsibility. I like the work; there just ended up being too much of it.

His family has a house on the beach and he insisted that I go with him. He knew how stressed I was. It was just what I needed. I essentially did what I planned to do at home. I slept a lot. I drank beer. I ate too much. But I did it surrounded by friends and on the beach. I returned to work recharged and ready for more.,3X87C8JFV7X37AKGTDCOQ3WRM0OSQ5,,0.0,retold

Nonetheless , after working tirelessly to construct everything it all came together with some hard work. The L shaped couch was built , with two air mattresses , solar lights where put up so they could see, projector was set up , tent was put up so she could have a sleep over in the same area. Nonetheless , the say had finally arrived when all my hardwood would pay off. My daughter turned the corner to see all i had done for her , and she immediately began to cry! Tears of joy of course, but she couldn't believe what i had don and how much it looked so wonderful. Later that day her friends arrived and were also astonished. I had popcorn , full size candy bars, pizza, and cooler full of sodas. They had a blast, and i could hear her friends saying how cool i was and couldn't believe your mom did this. It made me feel wonderful that all my hard-work paid off. But the best part was that my daughter will never forget her 14th birthday. Ever child should have memorable moments like this during there childhood and im just so happy i was able to pull it off.  I dont think i will ever forget myself , since it took so much work to put together.

We allowed the girls to purchase two movies to watch , whatever they wanted.  This was of course after the pizza , cake and presents were done. Then they headed outside. I can recall just hearing them laugh and being typical teenage girls. I wont ever forget that night since i was exhausted from preparing everything . But especially since the girls never went to bed! My bedroom was right near the tent so i heard them all night. I specifically recall them at 6 am saying there was donuts inside. As they ran to the front door i jumped out of bed and ran as well . Since a stampede of teenage girls were about to raid my kitchen. Overall , the girls ate there donuts and one by one went home. It was a success and i made it throught the whole ordeal .

While outside we did some work on the fence and otherwise just hung out and talked.  I got to know a couple of the prospects from that chapter as well and we got along great.  Then at one point myself and another prospect were called in front of the members.  We were grilled with questions like asking how many days we had and what we learned in that time.  At one point another member came up behind me and pulled my prospect cut off me.  I struggled a bit but he eventually got it off me and asked if I wanted it back.  If I did I would have to go through him.  My heart was racing and I was about to do it too, but then I heard the snap of a can opening.  As I turned around I saw several brothers walking up to me with open cans and proceeded to dump them on my and my other brothers head.  The feeling was cold but still felt so good knowing what it meant.  I felt a great sense of accomplishment and pride knowing my hard work has paid off.

I had been prospecting for a year at that point.  The greatest thing about it was that it was a surprise I was not expecting.  We were visiting another chapter out of town and as prospects we sat outside during the main meeting.  Partway through I was called in front of the club and they started asking me question after question.  I was nervous and firing answers as fast as I could.  Eventually someone came up behind me and took off my cut and I didnt know what to do.  As I turned around I had a beer dumped over my head and I immediately knew what was going on.  As the others joined in I knew this was one of the greatest days of my life.  It marked the completion of a year plus of hard work and a goal I had been pushing for.  Everything seemed to happen in slow motion after that.  My head was spinning with thoughts.  I couldnt help but smile and almost cry at the same time.  I was handed a set of full patches and told to put them on my cut ASAP.  I had them on in 5 minutes and could not believe the feeling.  I was riding an emotional high the whole way home and for some time after.  It is still one of the greatest days of my life being welcomed into this brotherhood.,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0Y5QRF,3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0Y5QRF,0.0,recalled

When we reached the hospital she had been rushed to the emergency room. we were all worried because we had never seen her in such a situation. we waited for almost 45 minutes without hearing a word from the doctors. After some few more years the doctor came out and told us that our sister was in a very delicate state and she had just died. just hearing that my mum fainted and i don't remember what happened next because when i woke up i was lying on the hospital bed. i started crying because i just watched her die without helping her out.. it was a very disturbing moment for me and my family until now we are still mourning",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV86IRQH,,0.0,retold

I had in mind exactly what I wanted and I knew it would be  very challenging to find one that met those expectations. I saw an add for this one and immediately contacted the owner about him. However, he did not fit perfectly what I had in mind. I decided to sit on it a week and think about it. I could not get him out of my mind and kept looking at his pictures over and over. I decided to make the 3 hour drive to check him out and as soon as I saw him I knew he was the one. I rode him and he was ok, but once again didn't fit exactly what I wanted. I knew in my heart though that he was perfect so I decided to give him a try and purchase him on the agreement that if he didn't work out right he could go back to the original owner. He worked out perfect and there was no looking back. He is my dream and we work wonderful together. My daughter changed his name to Butter from Tucker and it fits him perfectly.  He gets along with my other horses wonderfully, in fact one of them escaped to get in the pasture with him when I first brought him home. They are all best friends now and share their food wonderfully. He is very sweet and loving. He always wants to give hugs and nuzzles. He will talk to you anytime he sees you.",3XLBSAQ9Z5YQ241FS6XQM5CZFGM7ZA,,0.0,retold

He has only had one other owner his whole life so I know his background and training. He has no hidden ghosts in his closet, unlike Bourbon. His name was Tucker but he is being renamed to Butter because he really does look like a stick of butter. My daughter loves him and thinks that he is just the best thing ever.

Moving them into the dorms was a very long day. Their dorm does not have an elevator. No elevator! Not a single one! And of course, my kids are on one of the top floors. We carried mini-fridges, tvs, microwaves, so much stuff up all those stairs. The kids have two of everything because they do not room together. It was a pretty hot day, but it could've been worse so that was good. And at least it wasn't raining. After we move everything in, we helped them get all their stuff put away. My husband fussed that I should leave them alone to put away their clothes and make beds, alone, etc. But I wanted to get them off to a good year and plus, they won't be around all year for me pick up after. Finally at the end of the day, we took and got ready to leave. I did good and held back most of my tears, even though I was a bit choked up.

After all, two college bound kids means two of everything. But after trying a few times, we got the important stuff in the car. The rest of it were items that we could pick up in the town where the kids' college was. So a few laundry baskets microwaves were left behind for me to return to the store later.

I never thought I'd experience the closest thing to spirituality when I agreed to go to the zoo. While I've always enjoyed going I never had such a wonderful opportunity like this.  My mom, brother and I were all there, and I think we all shared this wonder. We all had our hand full of leaves purchased at the kiosk. I assumed I'd drop mine in fear. Giraffes are much bigger up close. Much, much bigger than horses. I was nervous on approach but the one giraffe that came to me looked into my eyes before she bent her head, and by that time I was so mesmerized I let her take the leaves. She knew I had more in the other hand so she waited patiently while I gave her the rest, and my reward was to be allowed to brush through her hair with my fingers. I even touched a velvety horn.  What surprised me was it's tongue. The giraffe's tongue touched my hand once, but I didn't mind. It wasn't too wet. It was a bit like a dog's but also very long and snakelike. And then I did it over and over. I kept running back to the kiosk for more leaves. My mom and brother were ready to move on, but I didn't want to go. I feel like this day changed me and made me want to study animals more. I work with dogs all day, 40-60 medium to large sized dogs, but I'm really thinking I'd like to study bigger animals.",3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2,,0.0,retold

It was a perfect day and it wasn't too crowded but the best part of all was I fed a giraffe for the first time. Actually I spent about an hour and a day's pay feeding giraffes. I couldn't stop, they were so beautiful. I don't know what it was about them, I don't usually like big animals like that but they were so gentle and friendly. I couldn't believe I was standing there face to face with a giraffe. It let me caress it's fuzzy ear antlers or horns or whatever those little nubbins are. I think the most surprising thing was when I felt a long black tongue, smooth like a dog's but not nearly as wet, as I put a leave up to it's mouth. It was like time stood still and nothing else mattered but me and that giraffe! I had fantastical ideas like saddling it and riding away, and wondered if that was even possible. I looked in it's eyes and I felt like we had some sort of cosmic connection. I don't believe in souls but if there were souls I think that giraffe definitely had one! It's really inspired me to work closer with animals. I know I can't train a giraffe like I train the dogs at work but I'd love to work up close with them one day. I will never, ever forget this day. I hope it changes my future.",3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22GDWEP2,0.0,recalled

My sister lives in another country and we had not seen her for 3 years. A week before the party she called to tell me that she was comming home as a surprise. We coordinated everything to meet her at the airport without others knowing, it was very exciting. Keeping the secret was difficult, But it was worth it. It was necessary to say some excuses that justify my absence from home for a few hours, answering hidden calls and asking other people to attend to my things while I was in charge of looking for my sister. My mother always said how much she wanted to see my sister and my sister told my mom that because of her work it was impossible to travel home. However she made the effort and bought the ticket. Not commenting on my mother was complicated because I wanted her to know that she would see her daughter and have that illusion. But the plan to arrive by surprise worked greatWhen the precise moment arrived and all the guests were already at home, my sister came through the door and everyone shouted in excitement, especially my parents. My mother could not believe it. She cried and jumped of joy. My dad was also very excited, so much that he even got a little dizzy. We all cry with joy and agree that we would not give any more surprises to my parents, since they are old people and those strong emotions can hurt them. I cried a lot of joy while recording everything on video.",,3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYRHI5H4,0.0,recalled

We bought a house that was simply beautiful and was pretty similar to what I wanted to have growing up. It was hard to believe that things were falling into place for me. While the house was great and the person I got to spend my life with was greater, something was still missing. We weren't really about kids, but we wanted to care for something. I had wanted a dog for a long time, and she was a dog lover herself. The breed was debated here and there, but we ultimately settled on a Maltese puppy. I believe we made the right decision. The pup has taken well to the household and we think that was what was needed to complete the home. I honestly just look forward to my future unfold before me.

The guy is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure whats gonna happen now, how I'm supposed to feel, and act. Growing up without a dad sucked, but having my uncle there, almost all the time was like having a dad around. The worst part about it is no one expected anything like this. He seemed like he was in just about perfect health, other than coming down with a minor cough. According to my mom, he's had the cough for a few weeks, and since it wasn't really getting better at all he went to the urgent care. They ran some tests, like normal, then called him the next day, and told him he needed to go to the hospital immediately. The hospital obviously ran more tests, and now says that the cancer is literally from his neck to his waist. They suspect it started in his lungs, and are blaming it on his smoking. They said a few days ago that he 3 to 6 months left to live. What really makes me mad about the whole thing is my mom keeping it a secret from me till a few days ago. She knows how close we are/were, and I understand not wanting to upset me. But its just kinda messed up in my opinion.  I'm pretty upset with her at the moment, but I guess thats the least of my worries right now. She should have told me though. Anyways, I'm going up to the hospital to see him in a few days, thankfully my wife is coming with me. I'm not really sure how I'm going to handle this in the moment.

Since my first writing, not much has changed between my mother and myself. We are definitely not as close as we were before any of this, and there has been no real attempt by either of us to repair our relationship. Again, to reiterate points I made in my first writing, my uncle is very important to me. He played a major role in my upbringing, was a massive influence in my life, and a very positive influence to that matter. Thankfully, I have been able to visit him a few times since the last writing, and have been in contact with him via text messaging quite a bit.  Unfortunately, in the last few weeks he has taken a turn for the worse, and is now back in the hospital again after being released for a short period of time. Two days ago we found out that his platelet count has dropped very low after receiving chemo treatment, which he never really wanted to have done in the first place. He says he has made his peace, and whatever happens is whats going to happen, and doesn't think it is worth it to keep racking up such high medical bills when there is no chance the chemo will be able to save his life. I am having a hard time with this, and am finding it very difficult to accept. I know that this how things go when someone is diagnosed with something such as this. But the man is like a father to me, and I'm not really sure where I am at emotionally at the moment. Thankfully I have a good support system in place with my wife, and friends, and they are really helping to keep the negative emotions at bay.  At this point, the doctors have no real expectations of how long he'll survive, as every time something positive happens, it seems like something equally as negative happens. But just like I said in my last entry, I am going to keep doing my best to stay positive, and keep hoping for the best. Maybe in the coming weeks my mother, and will begin to repair our relationship, and maybe not. But, things are what they are now, and there are far more important things on my mind than the way she chose to handle this situation.",3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZDF2DVQ,,0.0,retold

At this point in time I was coming up on being employed with the company for nearly twenty years.  My performance over the years had always met or even exceeded expectations.  However, recently the company gained a new CEO, and he wanted to speak about the program that I managed.  He wanted to schedule an appointment with my manager and myself to discuss the program. After a week or two had passed the meeting that was scheduled with the CEO was abruptly cancelled.  This concerned me, but not overly so.  A few days later my manager advised that she wanted to meet with me.  She let me know at that time that my role was being eliminated, and that I would be losing my job.  I was extremely upset.  I felt betrayed and abandoned by the company that I had worked for for nearly twenty years.  I was making good money and didn't know what I would do to support my family.  I felt depressed, defeated, and like a failure.  My wife and family were supportive and encouraged me through the tough times.

The house was small and wasn't really big enough for that which is why he didn't do it at first. But they wanted to be together and so eventually he did. When they first moved in, their son, my nephew, was a baby, not even a toddler. He couldn't speak or walk. He'd just crawl around the place and play with stuff. But he was there for several years. So I watched him grow up. I saw him every day as he went from a baby to a toddler to a little boy that could speak. I would play with my nephew every morning. He liked video games. Every morning before I went to work I would come down and sit in the living room, relaxing until it was time to go. But he learned that I would be down there, so he would crawl out of bed and come running down there to play. I would play video games with him until it was time for work. After work, I would play with him some more if I wasn't too tired. Though my brother's girlfriend lived with us, she worked in another city. So every day she had work she would have to take a long drive there and back. Her family lived in that other city. So over time she began staying with them for the half of the week she had to work and coming back for the days she didn't. But eventually she would stay away for longer and longer periods of time. One day I noticed that my brother was bringing a different woman home. I thought this was odd because even though his girlfriend spent half the month away, they always seemed to get along and she always told him she loved him every time she left or came back. Eventually, she noticed what was happening but there was no big fight or argument. She just brought her son with her to the city. And so suddenly the little boy that I played with every day was gone.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLEEZ843,,0.0,retold

We live in my mother's house that was left to us. It is big enough for both of us and has no rent or mortgage, so we live here. My brother has a child, my nephew. My nephew spends half his time living her and half living with his mother. The mother lives in a different city (not far, just a 30 or so minute drive) with her parents. I always had fun playing with my nephew but always knew I would only have a limited time to do so because he would have to live elsewhere to go to a decent school. I always thought my brother and the mother of his child had a good relationship. I don't know if they were ever officially married (though there was no wedding) but she uses his last name on her mail. Whenever she visits, she always ended the visit by telling my brother ""I love you"". But recently, I've noticed my brother spending a lot of time with a different woman. I say ""spending a lot of time with"" but it is clear they are dating. I don't really care about the relationship between my brother and the woman who gave birth to his child. However, seeing his relationship with this new woman gave me a bad feeling because I knew it would put my opportunity to see my nephew in Jeopardy. I've lived with my nephew since he was born. I watched him grow up, watched his personality began to develop. I grew very fond of him, though it is easy to grow found of a child. But I felt like I wouldn't be able to see him anymore if things continued. So one day, my nephew's mother found out about my brother's relationship with another woman. She didn't cry or scream like you see people do on tv or hear your neighbors do. She just took her son as usual. But she said she wouldn't bring him back. And so just like that, the little boy I've spent the last 5 years doting on and playing with was taken away. I am not close with his mother or her family, in fact I don't know her number or address, so I cannot go and visit. I just have to accept that my days playing with my nephew have ended.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLEEZ843,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLEEZ843,0.0,recalled

My supervisor had worked quite hard to press for my promotion and to champion me for this. When my supervisor told me of my promotion, he was quite pleased that he had finally managed to make this happen, especially since he was starting a new job in a different department soon and this was one thing he wanted to achieve before he was no longer my supervisor. He came into my office one morning and slid a folded piece of paper on my desk. He had a pleased smile on his face but said nothing, waiting for me to open the paper and see for myself why he was so happy that morning. I opened the paper and saw that it contained information regarding my promotion to a level 3 administrator. The change in levels pleased me since I was already performing level 3 job duties and felt that it was long overdue. The folded paper also held information regarding my pay raise and the percentage increase. This information fell a bit flat to me because it was much less than I had originally anticipated a promotion would bring. I received the same percentage increase for my promotion that I typically do for my annual raise. Seeing that lower number disappointed me, but I felt I couldn't show my supervisor my disappointment because he was so happy. Showing my disappointment would have been a slap in the face to my supervisor. He felt that he had done me a solid and the promotion, as well as the pay increase, was quite fair. It may be that I had the wrong ideas of what pay increase follow promotions. It could also be that my last promotion with the significantly higher increase was a fluke. I don't have much experience with promotions and don't know what is typical in the company.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,,0.0,retold

My boss walked into my office like he typically does and it's usually to chat about work related stuff as well as to chat in general about how things are going. This time, he started off chatting about normal, routine work stuff and then casually threw in that my promotion was finally approved and about to go into effect. He's been pushing for my promotion for over a year and a half at that point and I had almost given up all hope of this happening any time soon. Evidently, the higher up managers approved the promotion as well as Human Resources. A salary was also approved and my manager informed me of what that new, higher salary would be. I felt relieved that this finally happened and I could stop wondering about my upcoming promotion. At the same time, once my supervisor told me the percentage raise I would receive, I was slightly disappointed. The percentage of my increase equaled the usual annual salary increase I received the past couple of years, even without a promotion. I was unsure if this signified that my past annual increases were abnormally high or if my promotion salary increase was abnormally low. I was hoping for a much bigger raise. Ultimately, my supervisor informed me that there is a cap on how high of an increase an employee can receive in any given year and hopefully there will be more of a raise coming up after my annual review in a couple of months. Given that we had just had my annual review, performance reviews, and all that, I was hopeful that perhaps, even with my recent promotion, I would still qualify for a significant raise when the fiscal year was over.

It was an amazing experience for me and everyone who was there. There were hundreds of people at the event who were all there to celebrate him and his wifes love for each and the bond that they have. It felt weird to me, as I was his best man during the wedding, and it was awesome to see him moving on with his life, but hard to think that he was moving on from me and my other brother to create his own family. I love my brother so much, but it really was a bittersweet moment to me. The most memorable thing about the event was basically the wedding ceremony. I remember getting emotional as they were saying their vows, and it just created this weird sensation that I had never really experienced before.  His wife looked so beautiful, and he looked sharper than I had ever seen him. Another memorable part of the event was my best man speech. I remember not being able to think of the right things to say up until the very day they were getting married. I wrote my speech only a few hours before I had to give it. In it I described how if how my brother loved me was how he was going to care for her, than she was in good hands. I knew that they were going to have a happy and awesome marriage. It was an experience that I would not change for anything, and look forward to having one of my own. Still one of the most memorable experiences I have had in a very long time, and I still think about it when I think about my brother and how he is doing.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL84B,,0.0,retold

Coordination was crucial to ensure that everyone's code would integrate together smoothly. We would meet with the clients to determine what their needs were. In a lot of cases that is not always the same as what they think their needs are. Then we would come up with a software solution to those needs as a team. We would present the solution to the client to get their approval before starting work on it. We would also be in regular contact with the client during the development process, because a lot of times their perception of their needs change during development.

Quizzically, she just said my name again.  I greeted her and we embraced.  We hugged for what seemed like 10 minutes and then we finally broke apart and began to catch up.  I tried to keep everything casual but on the inside I felt a bit bad for her and missed her.  She told me about some of the rougher things that were going on and caught me up on what she had been doing.  By the end of it all, I couldn't help but to feel a bit bad but I was happy to have seen her.  We promised to keep in touch and then parted ways again.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,,0.0,retold

I was celebrating in different ways with family and friends for the most of the day but the last place I expected to be by the end of the night was a Target.  There's this girl I've known for about 13 years now.  During those 13 years we would date, break up, date, break up.  Eventually, the last time it happened, we stopped talking for the longest time period and to me it was like we both finally got the point that it wouldn't work out.  This night, someone wanted to stop really quickly at Target because they needed something to drink and another person wanted to grab something for their phone.  I break off alone and walk through the store to find something in particular and this familiar voice calls my name.  I'm terrified and happy at the same time when I hear it because I know it's her.  I think of all of the pain and heartbreak associated with her and how much I despised her after we stopped talking three years before.  Yet, there she was, saying my name in the gentle yet comforting way she always did and smiling at me like I was something to be proud of.  We walked towards each other, stunned, and embraced one another.  For what seemed like ages, we just held each other and didn't say anything.  Finally, after two minutes or so she whispered in my ear, ""I miss you"".  I walked around with her that night and we talked for a while and caught up.  She told me how awful her life had been going and expressed how she wanted to end it all.  By the end of it all, I unblocked her from my phone and saw older texts flood in.  I ended up calling her again.  It would probably turn out to be a mistake but realistically, even through all of the rough patches, she was the only one that really made sense to me.",3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,3YHH42UU5C1SF4KRS6L8ZBREQ3NL02,0.0,recalled

They induced labor and nothing was working correctly. She spent 3 days in the hospital before giving birth.  Me and my mother went to see her and my brother, even though they were exhausted.

I knew I loved her and would be happy to keep dating her, but I more and more felt I really wanted to make the full commitment. Eight years together and we've been through a lot, and nothing to make me think at all about breaking up. But it had to be a special moment when I finally asked her the question, and I just couldn't think how to make it something really memorable. I didn't want to propose when we were out for pizza or something ordinary like that! And then when we talked about going to the beach for a vacation, that just seemed so perfect. I knew I had to do it. The beach vacation was everything I thought it would be, and something so special to her as it was her first time. Walking along the boardwalk, playing the games, and of course the beach itself. She was so happy, having an absolute blast whether we were relaxing on the sand or playing in the water. So finally the perfect opportunity presented itself. We decided on the spur of the moment to go for a walk along the beach and enjoy the sunset, then get dinner afterwards. Thank goodness I had an excuse to wear something with pockets! I had the ring of course, and when we walked around one crop of rocks and saw the sun sparkling across the water, we both just stopped and looked for a few moments. That was it, I knew it'd never be more romantic than that. So of course I did the whole down-on-one-knee thing, which was goofy but it just felt right. As soon as that happened she knew what was coming and she started tearing up, and I don't know what I said but she said yes and it was perfect, absolutely perfect. We hugged, we kissed, we took a bunch of photos so we could share it later - and then went out for pizza! Maybe not the most romantic dinner, I know, but it didn't matter, it was great pizza and she was wearing my ring and we were both overjoyed. I just realized it's been two months! I still get such a kick out of referring to ""my fiancee"", and now we're talking about the wedding plans it's clear I did absolutely the right thing! This will be my wife soon!",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,0.0,imagined

I knew that it had to be now or never because we had been together for so long that people were starting to wonder if we'd ever be engaged. All I knew was that I was finally ready to be committed to her. I had the perfect opportunity when we went on a beach vacation together over the summer. It was the very first time she had ever been to a beach of any kind, so that made it even more special for us. A few weeks prior to the trip, I went to the jeweler that I had been ring shopping at for months and purchased the ring. I made sure that I kept it in the box but also inside another small container so she would never suspect it. I placed it inside one of my bags that I was bringing with me to the beach so I would not forget it. We were at the beach for a few days and when we were walking on the beach at sunset, I decided to propose right then and there. I got down on one knee on the sand and asked her if she would be my wife. She thankfully said yes, and at that moment I was the happiest person on the planet. It was also kind of funny because I recall not seeing anyone too close to us, but after she said yes I heard a couple people start clapping in the distance. I remember it being one of, if not the most, nerve wracking and scary moments of my life. I knew that she would say yes, but at the same time it still made me incredibly nervous. I am so glad that I finally had the courage to propose to my long-time girlfriend because she is the one. I will always cherish this magical moment for the rest of my life.",3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,,0.0,retold

We were on a beach vacation, and it was just the two of us. I had decided that this was the perfect place to propose because this was the first time she had ever been to the beach so it was very special for both of us already. I was slightly apprehensive that she would not like the beach and thus might not make the proposal as special as I wanted it to be, but it turned out that she loved it. I had a feeling that she would not suspect anything leading up to the trip, so my surprise was intact. I had purchased the engagement ring in April, and had it ready to go by the time we went on our trip in June. On our drive down I was feeling very nervous because while I knew I wanted to propose on this trip, I did not have a concrete plan on how to do it. But, we were going to be there for five days and four nights, so I knew I had time to make a decision. I finally decided that I wanted to take her out to a quiet part of the beach at around sunset and propose to her close to the water. This is a little cliche, I know, but she always told me she never cared how or where I proposed. I was wearing shorts that allowed me to easily conceal the ring in my pocket so she would never know. Also, I managed to get a local photographer to take pictures of the moment which I had to coordinate very carefully so my girlfriend would not know. We were walking along the beach and as we were doing so I could feel my heart pounding faster and faster as I knew the moment was coming. It was as if every moment and happy memory in our lives over the past eight years had come down to this. In my mind, I knew with absolute certainty that she would say yes, so I finally took her hand and faced her, with the wind whipping up small waves and the sun setting behind us. I got down on one knee and asked her the words that she was waiting to hear for a long, long time. In all honesty the entire moment seems like a blur to me even two months later. All I know and care about is that the woman I love said yes, it was just as magical a moment as I wanted it to be.",3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,0.0,recalled

We tried to make our parents understand our point of view but you know how South Asian families are when it comes to caste and religion. Only thing Oshan and I knew that very day back in April was that we were going to get married that month and we were going to go ahead with our plans no matter what obstacles we would have to face. See, Asian families have this idea of who a perfect partner for your child is. The thing they don't understand is that they want their child to marry a stranger just because they like that person, not even considering the opinion or the choice of their own child. Our case was similar. He was tall and I was short, I was a bit on the chubby side and I wore glasses. The only issue his family had with me was that I was fat, ugly and a christian. Too bad they didn't realize that I was a warrior. There was this one time when his father actually told my father that I was fat, and my father responded saying, ""I feed my children well and unlike your kids mine aren't malnourished.""! My parents were supportive of our marriage and relationship unlike his parents. Getting back to April, we decided we would get married after witnessing our families fight with each other regarding our relationship for nearly 2 years. On the 28th we went ahead as planned, at my house. Just like that we got married! No big wedding, just us and a few close friends and a good BBQ! I still remember the tiny little details just like yesterday. I was excited and so was he. He got me flowers in the morning to decorate and they were white and yellow. The skies were a bit dark and all of us were worried that it might rain in the evening, and it sure did! He came over with his friends in the pouring rain and was wearing a light grey suit. I was in an emerald green dress with a bouquet of flowers made with yellow, white and green. It was beautiful. Everything went according to plan. The only people missing were his family. They refused to come.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C6F27K3J,0.0,recalled

I had a wonderful day for the most part, and we had a lot of fun with our families. However, there was a couple unexpected events that made the day less than perfect. For starters, my MIL was being mean and said some negative things about me to my own father. She was not the only one that caused some issues during my wedding. My husband's aunt decided to take it upon herself to cut my wedding cake. Not only did she cut the cake without asking, she also destroyed the cake and ruining the top tier that my husband and I were planning to save for later for just the two of us. She made a mess out of our special piece, and offered it to guests. When removing our top layer, she dropped in on it's side on another plate. I will never forgive her for what she did, as the cake cutting was something that I had been looking forward to and planning since we first started planning the wedding. Even though it really upset me, I decided I wasn't going to show my anger or make a big scene. My close family knew that it upset me and helped make me feel better.

He has worked so hard, for so long. It was wonderful to see him recognized for all he's put into scouting. Many of our family and friends came which made it even more of an event to remember. He also had a part in the ceremony where he thanked everyone and told about what he'd learned over the years. As he came to each person, he told a little story about them and even came to tears several times. It was very emotional for me. He's 18 years old now so he's been in that period where he doesn't want to show his emotions to anyone, though he let his guard down at the ceremony. Several times I remember taking a look around to see all the people who were there to support him and it warmed my heart. I could not ask for a better kid. I think that was solidified in the way he presented himself at the ceremony. It will definitely be an event I will remember for the rest of my life. I know the ceremony had the same effect on many others there as well. I talked about it with my parents and they were surprised by how emotional my son was and thought it was a breath of fresh air to see a kid express himself openly like that.  It was the same for my wife and many others I spoke to.",3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYE8DCUW,,0.0,retold

His Eagle Scout ceremony was one that was very emotional and made me very proud. To see him up there, in front of many of our friends and family, giving a speech on what it means to be an Eagle Scout and how the journey to Eagle had made him the person he is brought tears to my eyes. He was very confident in his speaking, yet you could hear the crack of emotion when he mentioned certain people. You could tell that not only did his accomplishment mean a lot to him. But so did all the people who helped him along the way. As I sat there listening to him, I could not help but to think of the entire journey. It started when he was 6 years old as a Cub Scout. I was reminded of how hard he worked and how many fun times we shared on campouts and doing other activities related to Scouting. And I was so happy to have had the opportunity to share such moments with him. I also though of how proud I am that he is my son and also my best friend. He makes me a better person everyday through his behavior and the things that he does. I could not have asked for a better kid and I am so happy he has grown into the man he has. At one point during the ceremony, I looked around at everyone else who was there. I could tell he'd had a similar effect on them as well. They were proud of him and how hard he'd worked. They were also proud to know and that was perhaps the most heartwarming thing of all. To see others crying and sharing in the joy of his accomplishments was pretty amazing. It's something all parents should experience. It's a validation of sorts, and parents needs that, I think. Parenting is such a hard thing. There are so many times when doubt clouds your judgement or perception of things. This was all like a moment of clarity. I wouldn't trade it for the world.",3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYE8DCUW,3YZ8UPK3VU8FSM21D06TLZPYE8DCUW,0.0,recalled

I was walking my dog and stopped to talk to a friend of mine about mundane things.  After talking for a little bit, we both noticed a small furry animal walking up the walk towards us, stopping now and then as if it was lost and looking for home.  My friend called out to it with a series of ""clucks"" and clicking noises, and it immediately ran to us.  It showed absolutely no fear of my dog as it approached, and went directly to my friend.  He picked it up and it nestled into his arms, clearly enjoying the attention.  He then transferred over to me and nestled into my beard, licking it and playing gently with it.  It was a very young ferret, apparently lost or abandoned, and needed a place indoors.  Since he and my dog got along well, I volunteered to take him in until we found out where he belonged.  I searched online and newspaper lost and found resources, but there was no mention of any owners looking for him.  I recalled seeing a small cage in the dumpster earlier on the day we found him, and had my suspicions that he had been abandoned, but checked with our apartment manager just to make sure.  It turned out that the day prior, a family that had owned a ferret had moved out, also abandoning their dog inside the apartment.  I couldn't believe that someone would commit such an act, and promised my new little friend that he would have his forever home with me.  The abandoned dog had already been picked up by animal control, and I later found out it was adopted out too.  This little ferret is now bonded with me and my family and we couldn't imagine life without the little terror.  Always into whatever is left out, but never misses a chance to make me laugh, or at least smile.  All-in-all this was one of the best days in my recent history, and I wouldn't change it for anything.",3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF5AQ3QG,,0.0,retold

He walked with us for a bit, talking about life in general, when we spied a little creature slinking along the sidewalk.  It was curious about us, and showed absolutely no fear of my dog or us.  My friend crouched down and called to it, and it ran right to him and allowed him to pick it up.  It was a young ferret!!  The poor little guy was fully tame and wanted human attention.  We figured that it must be lost, and I agreed to take it in while we asked around and checked the papers and social media to find it's owner.  Later that day, I found a small cage and leftover ferret food in a dumpster near where we found him.  I put two and two together and realized that someone had actually thrown him away.  Such cruelty and careless attitude!  I decided right then that even if we found the ""true"" owner, I wasn't returning him.  Upon further investigation, we found that a person had been recently evicted, and had not only thrown the ferret in the garbage, but had also abandoned their dog in their now vacant apartment.  I now had to make a choice - do I want to keep and raise this adorable little weasel, or hand him over to animal control to be adopted out.  The decision was quite easy for me.  Although I knew nothing about ferrets, he was so cute and loving (as well as a little terrorist to my dog), I would research everything I knew so that this little guy would have the best life possible.  While caring for him has added a lot of additional responsibility, time and financial investment, he's just about the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.  He's now a full-fledged member of our family, and even my aging dog has accepted him, and even goes so far as to ""protect"" him when we play ""too rough"".  Looking back, the day we found him was the best day so far this year.",3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF5AQ3QG,3Z3ZLGNNSJGZNTZ13YBNIVOF5AQ3QG,0.0,recalled

I made him a great big old chocolate cake and when we gave it to him with the single candle to blow out he took his fists and slammed into the cake haha. Thankfully I had two cakes because I knew that he was likely to try and smash this one, he is such a rambunctious little boy. I actually catered out another cake for the adults and older kids to have a slice from, but Jimmy got to really destroy the big one I baked! My best memory of the day was his smile covered with sticky icing as he waved his hands around happily. It was a bit of a mess to clean up but he was so happy.

We tried to take a video of him smashing the cake, but he was too obsessed with the strawberries.  He insisted on picking off and eating each one individually.  Eventually we had to turn off the video and just wait for him to finish eating the strawberries.  When he finally did get to the cake, he jumped right in with both hands and made such a mess.  It was adorable and made for some great pictures. I think I was the only parent who ever wanted their kid to stop eating fruit and eat cake! It was so fun though. He had a great time.

There were a lot of memorable things that made the event special. However, the most memorable was when I realized that I had actually won the election itself. This was significant in that it started a new chapter in my life. I was going to be starting a new job as an elected official, that meant having new things to learn about. I was also going to be in the public eye and needed to do some soul searching regarding behaviors and things I participated in. It was almost like a complete transformation except my mind was the same. This event opened up so many networking doors and now has promoted me to start my MBA (which will be finished in January of 2021) and proceed to take the LSAT and hopefully accomplish my dream of getting my law license. During the event, I learned a lot about myself including my goals and my drive. I challenged myself to disregard negative comments and focus on the goal at hand. This was a deep process for me and I feel that I came out of it stronger and better as a person. To be the first female and republican in 100 years gives me great pride. I value the accomplishment and it fuels me to be better. I am constantly making my father and mother proud with my accomplishments. I look forward to where this road takes me.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLMA41Z12,,0.0,retold

The event that I am describing is my first direct experience being a political candidate in a local election. I experienced all sections of the process from getting my name on the ballot, to fundraising, to strategy, etc. While there were many memorable parts in retrospective thinking, the most memorable part was when we figured out I was the first in my political party to hold the particular office when I was elected, the first female in history and the youngest to ever be elected to the position. This is significant to me because of the struggles to prove myself to my community and my generation. There were a lot of uphill battles to prove my work ethic and my desire to serve. I am reminded daily of this event by going to work and continuing my service to my constituents. I am constantly reminded by the hurdles I overcame by being a single female on the ballot. The reminders of election night, and my father swearing my in and my first day in office will forever be a part of my memory. Daily I am faced with new found struggles.

I am not able to have kids which makes me sad because I really like kids and always wanted to have a big family. My younger brother is married and has two girls. The one is older and is from his wives previous relationship so I did not know her until she was like four years old.  I love her now though as if I have known her forever and no matter what anyone says she is my niece.  The younger one I have been around since she was born. She has had health issues and I have been there for all of them.  For the last five years I have helped to raise her and take care of her and play with her. I have literally been there for everything. Sometimes I think it gets confusing for her and she even calls me mommy sometimes which is funny but super cute.  Well I knew the time was coming. She is old enough now to go to school which means my days are not going to be filled with craziness and hugs and kisses and playing with a small child.  She started kindergarten.  I am sad of course because now I will not have as much time with her but I am also happy because she loves it and is learning things and making friends.  Just the other day I had to help her with some homework, which I find it crazy that she has, but she was so proud of herself for doing it.  It is a big step for all of us. Hopefully it continues to be a wonderful adventure.

There was no fight, there was no argument, she just looks you in the face, tells you she loves you and that you are an ""amazing man"", but she just doesn't feel right and wants to leave. I have never been more confused in all my life, HOW can I be an ""amazing man"" and yet she wants to leave. But there it was, she had been looking at places to move behind my back for months and I guess seeing someone else as well. I bought my first house with this woman, adoped a dog with this woman and swore to take care of this woman (to her father) and now she wants to leave. We bought the house, that house flooded two months later, I busted my butt to rebuild and make it more comfortable for HER, not me HER. And now she's leaving. My purpose for having a house and rebuilding it the way I did was there no longer. One of the hardest things in my life. So what to do? Well, I pack. She didn't want to be there, she was coming to get her stuff (eventually), so I began to pack every-single-thing of hers and shove it away. So I didn't have to see it. Pots, pans, utensils, everything that could be taken down or moved was packed. Anything that reminded me of her. I repainted rooms, redecorated, tried to make what I built for her mine in a few weeks time. I spent time outside and built a patio, I built furniture that would replace the ones that I bought for her. When her dad and uncle came to help her pack they had tears in their eyes, I guess they loved me too (or knew how much pain I was in). They didn't know why I did most of the hard work for them, it was because they were great men and I wanted them to be my family, hell, sometimes I still do... but it just wasn't meant to be. I helped load her up and send her on her way to a new life, and I was left trying to rebuild mine... again.",3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX4H5U05,,0.0,retold

She said it just didn't fell right, after 3 years! We bought a house together (luckily I put that in my name only), adopted a dog together and I was starting to plan out our future. Then that rug was pulled out from underneath me, like Thanos snapping his damn finger. Did I see it coming? Not at all, I thought she was the one. Should I have seen it coming, yup! She would often travel to see her family which lived over an hour away, sometimes I'd go, sometimes not. I found out she was talking to an ex of hers, but sometimes people make mistakes. We found about it, and got on with life. Her friends (who are still my friends which is odd) told me that they warned me, well I guess I was so in love it would have taken a Mack truck to hit me with it. So here I am, heartbroken and just me and the dog (and yes, I told her I was keeping him and there wasn't going to be a discussion about it) so what do I do. I begin to pack all her crap up, YUP, EVERY LAST BIT. Why? Because I loved her, and I loved her family, and why punish her family by making them do it. So there I am, boxing and storing lady's under garments and unmentionables. All plates, pans, cooking utensils, eating utensils, sheets, towels, hell even lightbulbs. She made me keep the furniture because it was too much, she said, but everything else that reminded me of her is gone. I know what a divorce feels like, well except the whole court/lawyer fee thing. Fast forward to now, I'm still without most of the crap she took with her. I bought a stainless steel pot set because I liked the look, but I can't cook on it for crap, so I don't use it much. One set of sheets, 1 towel, paper plates and plastic forks. I kinda wish I wasn't such a smartass and kept some of it, but I wanted her to know I could do it without her. Can I though? MaybeThe dog thinks so anyway",3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX4H5U05,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX4H5U05,0.0,recalled

He was a manager and was very important to the company.  He was being expected to work the jobs of three people and only get underpaid for the job of one person.  He was stressed and fed up with the job so he decided to start his own business.  Literally only a month and a half later, with only a company name and super basic website, his boss found out about the new business and fired him on the spot.  No questions were asked - he assumed my husband was trying to undercut the company and steal work.  My husband had no such desire, he wanted to get away from the work that company did but was planning to stay with the company until his contracts that he had brought in were completed since nobody else in the company was qualified to work on those contracts.  Its also worth mentioning that at least three other employees were doing side work or had side businesses and the boss had no problems with that what so ever.  So now we are still working super hard to get this new business up and running.  It normally takes a long time to get a business off the ground so we are really struggling.  My husband is working long hours and much of it is without pay because its just his efforts towards a blog and another project that does not have funding yet.  We are hopeful for the future but there is a lot that is still unsure in our lives.  I am doing my best to be a supportive and encouraging wife and contribute as I can.  I am cutting our costs as much as possible and doing work on mTurk and selling things to pay for our basic expenses.  This is a huge adjustment for us but hopefully it will pay off in the future.",3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DFOBZCM,,0.0,retold

Many concerns crossed my mind.  How will we afford food?  How will we pay our mortgage?  How will we send our kids to the private school that they love and thrive at?  My husband and I both worked diligently over the next few weeks to get everything set up for the business that we thought we would have a year to accomplish.  We opened a bank account, fixed up the website, created a LinkedIn account, and started emailed companies looking for work.  He also attended a conference to try to make some connections there.  Many people were interested in his capabilities but it takes time to get a contract officially signed.  My husband created his first blog post and it quickly received a significant amount of attention from the tech community.

He passed away four months ago. It was one of the most horrific things I've ever had to deal with. I had been taking care of him for a year prior to his passing. I quit my job and he became my full time job along with parenting my three year old. The day that it happened was sort of unusual. My mom was coming to visit. It was the first time they had been in the same room with me since their divorce. Also, my wife and I were arguing all day. This was probably due to the stress. My mom and I went to the store to pick up a few things and my wife text me. The message said she had called for an ambulance for my dad and I needed to come home immediately. When I pulled into the driveway I saw the EMTs inside my house. This is unusual because he was always able to meet them outside. My dad was nearly unconscious as they wheeled him out on a stretcher. The EMT said I could come in the ambulance. On the way out I slapped my dad's face and he came to long enough for me to tell him I was there and for us to lock eyes. However, I knew it was the end. We had done this at least twice a month for a year. But this time felt different. On the way to the hospital he had a massive heart attack and died for all intents and purposes. They could never get him back at the hospital and I told them to stop chest compressions. It was the worst day of my life.",,3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DPSWCZ2,0.0,recalled

We had made reservations at a new restaurant we all were excited to try out, which turned out to be fantastic. We stuffed ourselves with steak and garlic pork, had a few drinks. We told old stories and laughed about dumb things we used to do when we were younger. The restaurant knew it was my birthday and brought out this enormous piece of dessert with the plate decorated with cocoa powder and the words Happy Birthday in melted chocolate. Even though we were full to the brim, we managed to knock that dessert down! The next couple days passed in a sort of blur. We didn't actually go out and do much of anything special, but we stayed up late every night, talked about every topic under the sun. Just like we used to. When it was finally time to say goodbye, it was a little rough. I didn't want them to go so soon, as it seemed like they had just gotten there. They didn't want to go either, for the same reasons.

We talk and text and email, but we haven't been able to see each other since before she had her son, as she lives several states away now. The day finally came. She was on her way! She texted when she arrived at the airport and then again when she had gathered her things and was on the way. A short while later, I saw the car pull into my driveway and I flew to the door. There she was! Different, but the same. We hugged and maybe we both cried just a little. I got to show her my house that I am very proud to have been able to finally purchase after many years of saving. We got to hang out and just talk, for the first time in forever, face-to-face. She had arranged for us to have a special dinner at a really nice restaurant that we'd had both been wanting to try. My partner was with us too. I think having him there made it even more special, since they're both such important parts of my life. He thought it was so cute to see us together and to finally meet her after all these years.

I thought: Oh, this is that place that Norman Rockwell paints for the Saturday Evening Post. The bus ride to Barre was so long that it seemed I really was headed into Canada, if not the Arctic Circle. There were no interstate highways in Vermont at that time. We motored up Route 14 along the White River Valley out of White River Junction. Finally we got to Barre, and I was picked up at the bus stop by my assigned farmer, Louis Carrier, and taken to his dairy farm on a hill in Williamstown. I was thrilled that he was going to keep me on. I had no money for a bus ticket home. I spent most of my first month’s pay on maple syrup purchased at a general store and mailed home. Why was it so expensive? I wanted to show my family that I was going to be the kind of working man who shared his wealthI made certain I did everything right, but went light on feeding the calves to allow me enough time to sneak in the house and scoop out some ice cream before the family got home.

He said he explained that once he fixed it we would give the discount back. That was never mentioned and just sounds ridiculous. He insisted we heard what we wanted and was very angry.

We hired an air conditioner contractor. This was after much research as well as numerous quotes and checking out many companies. The amount for a new heat/air unit was something we had to take a loan out for. We wanted to get it right because it is a large expense. We chose the company, they came out and we went through our options of different units and chose the best one for our 1,600 sq ft house. We even chose to pay a little more for a brand we trusted. The workers tore out the old unit and put in the new. He did not put in a new thermostat as he forgot to bring the digital one we ordered, he came back 2 days later and asked how the unit was doing, I explained it was very loud and sounded like tennis shoes in a dryer, He checked out the system, made numerous adjustments but could not get the sound to go away. He was confused and asked that I allow him to go and research and call the manufacturer to get ideas on what the problems was. He came back the next day with what we thought was a solution but it still didnt work. In all of his confusion he requested a few more days assuring me it would be taken care of. Another couple of days passes and he comes back with yet another solution from the manufacturer. This again did not work.He then wanted his money but of course, he wasent going to pay him when my brand new air unit sounded like an old dryer. He said because of all of the trouble he would take 10% off of the cost. We agreed and he discounted the price by about $600. He also promised in writing he would take care of the problem or install a brand new unit.A week later he shows up with yet another solution that this time cut the noise down by 75%, we were happy with that and the discount. I paid his worker an additional $150 for other trunkline work done that was not included in the total price. He then said he needed to collect the rest of the money for the air conditioner?? we were shocked what?? you were paid in full. He proceeds to tell us that was a discount just until he got it fixed? What really? I never heard of someone especially a business giving a temporary discount and this was never discussed. He proceeded to become angry that we were not giving the discount back and threatened to sue us for the $600.",3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61QT9W3C,,0.0,retold

I woke up early that day, around 5am. The weather was unseasonably warm as I stepped outside to head to the gym to get a swim in. Baby Cameron, the name my husband and I had picked out soon after I found out I was pregnant, was taking his time being born. The night before, my husband and I had discussed our options for inducing birth if it didn't happen naturally this week. I was scared because I had read that induction can cause complications. That of course didn't need to happen, thankfully. Maybe the shock of the cold water or the mild exercise induced labor, but as soon as I stepped out of the pool I felt my first contraction. I immediately called my husband. He rushed from home where he was getting ready from work to pick me up and take me into the hospital. When we arrived at the hospital I was immediately taken to a delivery room. The doctor I had chosen for my birth was thankfully on duty at the time and was able to come in right away. He checked my cervix and announced that the baby would come soon. The next few hours that followed were a blur of pain and hard work. I opted for a natural birth with no medication, and I'm glad I did. It wasn't fun, but I got to fully experience the wonder of birth. My husband was at my side the entire time while I squeezed his hand. Finally, at 11:01am, Cameron was born. He was a beautiful baby with a thick head of black hair. He has his father's eyes, and my button nose. The nurses all said he was the most handsome baby they had ever seen. After nine months of waiting, I couldn't believe that it only took five hours for my son to arrive. We stayed overnight at the hospital so that his health could be monitored. A breast feeding specialist came in to make sure Cameron was latching that morning. After that, we were able to head home with our new son.",,3ZWFC4W1UVTUF6UU081POUNHDM7FRL,0.0,imagined

Immediately he went over and started chatting with my dad and quickly my dad knew that he wanted me to be with this man. We continued to bounce around and have fun but eventually we headed back to our apartment. At the time we were living together as friends. When we got back we started talking about feelings and what we wanted in the future. Everything seemed to be aligning perfectly. Finally he looked at me and said ""are you in?"" I looked back with a big grin on my face and said ""Yes, I'm in"". Ever since that day we've been nearly inseparable except when he is spending time with my dad. That night had a huge impact on me and I will forever remember it.",,,0.0,recalled

She and her fiance(now husband) had a very simple, beautiful wedding in the mountains. They wanted an intimate, small wedding and that's exactly what it was. There were only about 25 guests invited. Several of us camped for the weekend at a campsite area where they held the ceremony. The grooms uncle officiated the ceremony, which made it even more special for everyone. A simple ceremony was held among the trees, while the guests sat in chairs to witness the vows. She was so beautiful and the ceremony so lovely, it made me cry. This was such a significant event in my life and I think about it very often. We now also have the pictures and video of the wedding to enjoy looking at. After the ceremony was a lunch and reception at their campsite. The traditions of cake and cake cutting, dancing, etc was done. Later that afternoon we all drove up to the top of the mountain and the uncle performed a ""hand ceremony"" for them. Beautiful Mount Rainier was in the background. It was very special.",,,0.0,recalled

I was told that I was going to be promoted to a much higher position in the company. This job would come with a huge pay increase and I would now be in charge of a team of people. It would also come with added responsibilities but I was fine with that. I was extremely happy and felt very proud of myself for finally achieving the job that I wanted. After I immediately accepted the job offer and promotion, I was congratulated by the two other people in the room. I left the meeting and went straight to the phone to message my partner the great news. After work I went out to celebrate with my family.

But i was also glad i got to tell her how much i loved her days before she passed. After her funeral we all celebrated and all of us had amazing stories to tell about our amazing loving grandmother. Her side of the family that was still alive came, also my grandfathers side of the family came. All her friends and all the people she has helped over the years also attendant. She also planned weeks before she passed away. Her and my grandfather had a talk and she also wrote letters to each and everyone of us along with a video. She had also planned her whole funeral and i thought that was amazing. The funeral that she planned for her self was great and hope i could do that when its time for me to go. We all celebrated the whole day. People that we haven't seen in years came and i felt like that brought us a bit closer. Ever since that has happened we plan family Friday  twice a month, we all get together and just have fun. One of the moment of that day i will never forget was when it was time to bury her,  when it was time to go down it started to rain so hard out of no where and it stopped when she was finally cover. I thought that was strange but amazing because it made me feel like she was saying goodbye to us. Even though it was sad it was also a good day because the stories that i heard were great and also learned new things about her that i never knew, I will never forget that day.",,,0.0,recalled

We had been moving boxes and stuff but getting the majority of the last things came all at once. I asked my uncle to help me move my bed. Michele and I were both excited and looking forward to this. We quickly got all of our things moved over and I was setting up my cat a place in a room by herself so she was not overwhelmed. It all went pretty well really. That night we built a fort and played with the cats, she also has two of them. It was really fun, we both enjoyed ourselves. We laughed and had fun all night.

It was not my fault at all, some imbecile ran a stop sign and t-boned me. However, the idiot told the cops I ran a red light, and since there were no witnesses, it was a mess.

They took this footage to the other insurer and I was offered damages for my car. I refused and said I wanted damages and diminished value for my car, since if I try to sell it, it will come up as a car that was in a wreck. Initially they refused, but since I had a tape of what had happened, I was eventually able to get damages plus diminished values. It took way longer than it should have and I was in a rental car for over 2 weeks.  However, on the plus side, the rental car was a really cool Jeep that I would have never driven before. It was brand new, with only a couple hundred miles on it. It was like having an extended test drive. And that test drive happened to be free eventually. I hated having to do this because insurance companies move so slowly. I had to initially pay for the rental without knowing if I would get reimbursed.",,,0.0,recalled
