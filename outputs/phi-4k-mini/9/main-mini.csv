I went to the local appliance store that's near my home. After arriving at the store I looked around a little bit to see what they had. I went to buy a griddle and there was only one left. I reached to put the last one in my cart. There was another lady there that also wanted a griddle. She stole the griddle from my cart. I was really feeling that move from her so I took it right back. I didn't think things would get that serious over a griddle. After getting the griddle back I browsed around the store a little bit more. I did find a few more things that I ended up grabbing to use. Things that would compliment my new griddle. So finally I went to the cashier to check out. I was finally ready to leave the store. I accomplished what I had came to the store for. I am very happy but also a bit conflicted about the woman who tried to take my griddle.,,308XBLVESJQ42PIEV6FT54WWOMSRBE,0.0

He was born with a condition called polydactylism, which means having extra fingers or toes. In my son's case, he was born with an extra pinky toe on his left foot. As a baby it was easier to manage, since babies obviously don't need shoes, but now as a preschooler his extra little toe would often hurt him while wearing tennis shoes. My husband and I always knew that he would need this surgery, but we were still worried when the day actually arrived. Neither he nor I, nor our older son, had ever needed surgery before. This was uncharted waters for us. When we arrived at the hospital Thursday morning, the nurses took his vitals to make sure he was healthy enough for surgery that day. Other than that, a lot of the time was just spent waiting. It made my husband and I feel sad because our son was hungry but he was not allowed to eat prior to the surgery. Thankfully the hospital did have a good amount of toys that helped keep him distracted. Finally around 12:30 in the afternoon he was taken back for his surgery. My husband and I were not allowed to go back with him, but the nurses and doctors made it fun for him by taking him back in a big push car. Once they got to the room, they put a small mask on his face with the strawberry scented gas he had picked out earlier. After he was asleep with the gas, they put the needle in his hand for the other anesthesia. Surgery only lasted about one hour. The nurse came to get my husband and I to take us to where our son was recovering. He's normally a really happy little guy, but unfortunately he was in a lot of pain and very confused coming out of his surgery. He ended up needing three shots of morphine in his IV to manage the discomfort. Thankfully it seemed to work quickly and soon we were on our way home. He seems to be recovering well and we're thankful his surgery was an over-all uneventful, yet memorable, experience.",308Q0PEVB9Z8LX0Y7Z7O060FETEI96,308Q0PEVB9Z8LX0Y7Z7O060FETEI96,0.0

Most of the time, that's not a problem, but every now and then, it is.  I've had to put up with some incredibly obnoxious neighbors there in the past.  Consequently, I always hold my breath when someone's moving out until I know who's going to live there next, always hoping for the best.  This new neighbor moved in as fast as my old neighbors moved out.  I heard her over there the first day she was there and I walked over to introduce myself to her.  She's ten years older than I am, single, and very pleasant.  As it turns out, surprisingly, we know a lot of the same people and have a lot of interests in common.  Our values seem to be the same, and both of us want to be good neighbors, which is a relief to both of us.  (She was concerned about what type of person I was, too.)  My new neighbor and I quickly started becoming friends.  When we see each other outside, we always take a few minutes to exchange pleasantries and talk.  She has trouble doing some things because she has a bad back, so I've been helping her out whenever I can.  She's so grateful for that, she's gone out of her way to do some things for me.  She loves to cook and she's shared meals with me.  She has little dinner parties every other week or so and I'm always invited.  I've really enjoyed getting to know my new neighbor.  I always enjoy seeing her and I know she's there for me.  If I have to go away, I know she'll keep an eye on the place for me, and likewise, I'd do the same for her.  It makes living in such close proximity very comfortable, and that's worth its weight in gold.",30BXRYBRP5JJ1Y2MUSZVEE7BBFDHWQ,,0.0

It was a great way to get away from the family, and I was very thrilled to be doing so. I brought my larger tent, as I felt the 2-man tent was not going to cut it. I had to find a clearing in the woods so that I could place it, and there was a nice spot about 300 feet in from the road. However, it was overshadowed by a 25 foot dead pine tree that was in the process of falling over. I pulled out my axe and helped it, knocking it down in about 10 minutes of work. I had to use my saw in certain parts due to the way the tree was angled. Once I finally got it down, I had plenty of firewood at my disposal, right next to my camp! I proceeded to de-limb the tree for kindling, and then sawed the larger main trunk of the tree for actual firewood. After clearing the area for about an hour, I now had a nice flat place to put my tent. I pitched my tent after sweeping the area with a few branches. When that was done, I decided to scour the area for large stones so that I could build a fire pit. I found about a dozen decent sized stones and carried them back to the campsite. I dug a small pit and arranged the stones around it, a wonderful start to my camping trip. From that point on, it was basically cooking, enjoying the scenery, and being along with my thoughts. I did some scouting around the area and found a very old graveyard, which I estimated to be at least 140 years old! The strange thing is that it was on top of a mountain, so someone had to come up here to build it. I feel it was an appropriate place, as the area was quite beautiful and had a wonderful view. I really enjoyed my camping trip up in the woods and got some much needed relaxation and time to myself, without the chattering of my wife and children to distract me. I plan on doing this again and cannot wait until my next trip.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8SX0M,0.0

We had just seen a movie and were coming back to my house when we were hit out of nowhere.  The driver of the other car got out and was visibly intoxicated.  He seemed very nervous and wanting to get out of there before the cops arrived.  There were some cops right down the street so it didn't take them long to arrive.  They asked a few questions and took a few pictures.  I saw in the distance that they were giving the other driver a field sobriety test.  After that, I just remember seeing them put the other driver in handcuffs and loading him into the back of a cruiser.  It actually ended up being a bit fortuitous, in that we received a decent payout from the other driver's insurance, most likely because he had been intoxicated.  Neither of us have any lasting injuries.  I had a little soreness in my neck for a few days, but the doctor said it was just some minor whiplash.  I actually haven't even thought about it since the last time I did the essay, since there really wasn't any lasting consequences.  The car was totaled out, but still drives fine (in fact, it was already totaled out before that due to some hail damage on the body).  I'm just relieved that nobody was hurt and it wasn't more severe.",30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1WIE0XV,,0.0

He worked at an electronic shop as a sales representative so he did not make enough money yet he spends much more than he earns. It was that bad that i sometimes began to imagine how Jennifer managed to put up with all of his excesses .The most devastating problem about Nathan was that he was a chronic womanizer. In the course of there relationship he has cheated on Jennifer more than seven times, the ones i can still remember or would i say the ones he was caught and could not deny them. Jennifer was sometimes traumatized and always caught in an emotional blackmail. She suffered a lot during the six years of there relationship. I could not understand why she keeps condoling his act of cheating on her. So one day she cried and came to me to complain about how Nathan has just cheated on her i was so mad at her, Nathan and her entire relationship that i screamed at her attempting to give a  piece of my mind. I asked her what she was doing with that good for nothing man, she told me she loved him so much and that she has tried to stop loving him but cannot. the more she tries the more the love increases and how she can not live without him . In frustration i told her to leave my house and that i did not want to hear about Nathan and her relationship with him ever again. both after two years their relationship was still on. Nathan had apologized to her and she forgave him as always and there were back together. Nathan got some religion into his life, he is now a christian. Jennifer told me how everything about Nathan has tremendously changed. I saw the joy i hadn't seen in her for a long time i was happy for her. I was so shocked one morning when she told me that Nathan proposed and she accepted and she would want me to be her maid of honor on her wedding day i was honored to do it and so i was the Maid of Honor in my best friend's wedding. I stood by her and watched her marry her husband.",,30IQTZXKALSNFY1G6POWA5M1W8T0XQ,0.0

My kids are ready going to their college in next a few year. We scheduled for 9 university information sessions and the corresponding campus tours during this trip. We have greatly enjoyed this impressive and informative trip. We directly contacted with the teachers and students from these universities and learned a lot of new information about our interested university. This was a very important visit for my kids to prepare their university applications later on. As their parents, we also felt this visit was very helpful for us to prepare for the coming important events. We learned how to start the preparations for the promising universities earlier. My son has been aiming on his dream school, MIT, because his friends went to this school. I helped him to sort the candidate majors out and went through the admission pages carefully. After talked with the teachers and students there, my son recognized what were his strengths and weaknesses. He said he would start preparations of his standardized tests more earlier. He have made a detail plan for the next 3 years for this endeavor. I thought that it would be better for a family to arrange this kind of campus visit more earlier, i.e. 3 years prior to the university application. This kind of activities obviously encouraged my kids to be more active on their studies. As parents, we also could help them in more specific manors instead of non-focused ways. Through these visits, my kids had their direct experiences with the university campus life. We learned more detail about their interested majors in the candidate universities instead of just numbers such as accept rate and university ranking. We would narrow down the school list and re-visit some of them in the future. In summary, this trip was a very important for us to help the kids to prepare their college application in the coming years.",30JNVC0ORA6EH160IJ0PMPPPOFBQHD,,0.0

We all wanted to get ourselves and our kids together for them. We have always been a close family. We spend most holidays together and always enjoy each others company. The 4th of July is everyone's favorite. It's during the summer. The kids can play and swim together. The adults get to catch up and drink. We always have a really nice barbecue. This is definitely one of my favorite holidays.,,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFG7Z9JS,0.0

The weather looked like it would be hot, but there did not seem to be any chance of thunderstorms until the day before the wedding. I wasn't too worried about it when I first woke up, because it was very sunny and hot out. My bridesmaids and I went to get our hair done, and my family went to the venue to start setting up. The day was already rushed because it is so easy to get behind and we had a strict deadline for when the wedding needed to be over. We finally arrived at the venue around 2pm. We began to take some family photos and some first look photos, and the day was still very sunny. I went inside to freshen up before the ceremony at 5, and I noticed it was starting to get darker and windy. I could hear commotion out in the hall, and finally, a huge crack of thunder. All of the guests had already arrived, so they ran to help my husband get the chairs out of the rain and into the banquet hall. They just made it before a deluge of rain. The storm passed in about 15 minutes, and then we had to set everything up outside again. However, the wedding really came together with all of our friends and family helping out. We only start the ceremony about 20 minutes late, and there was a rainbow there as we said our vows. It ended up being perfect!",30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFOOU9JT,,0.0

It was my sister, her boyfriend, and myself getting ready to enjoy a very American vacation. The next day was the 4th of July fireworks on the lake. The town had a special event every year where people would take their families out on the boats and huddle up in a cove near the town fairgrounds. From the fairgrounds they would launch off tons and tons of fireworks. All in perfect view for the huddled up boats. It was incredible to watch and such a unique experience. There were more boats than I ever remembered there being in the past. Boats blast off their own choice of song as the nearly 45 minute show continued, much to the enjoyment of everyone after a 10 minute disappointing show the previous year. Many people would bring foods to snack on and some would even have grills aboard their boats. It was such an American smell. The smell of fireworks, delicious food and a summer breeze. Seeing the fireworks reflect off the water is truly something else. You could also relax in the water on a raft during the show with the pitch black water below. It's truly a one of a kind experience unique to the area and something I'd gladly do again next year. We spent the rest of the time at the lake enjoying warm weather and family time as well as travelling in town for some antique stores.",30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFG7Z9JS,,0.0

This home had 4 acres and a 6 car garage which we fell in love with.  After a visit to a bank for a pre approval we have decided to list our home as for sale by owner on zillow make me move to make the offer seem better contingent on sale of our home. The evening of us making an offer on the house we liked they have accepted an offer overbidding the asking price. Being that our home was still on the market on zillow I had a realtor reach out to me to show the house to his client. A few days later a lady came with her realtor and spent about an hour touring the home.  By the end of the tour she deicded to buy the house for full asking price for a cash deal. I was really surprised and thrown off by this especially since there was no other lined up home for us to purchase. I could not say no to an offer that was presented even with circumstances of us not having anywhere to go at the moment. Because the deal was a cash sale there was not much but a home inpection and closing date was chosen 3 weeks from signing the sale agreement. In the span of 3 weeks we found a rental with only a week left to closing. In a manner of 1 day we moved the entire home into a very nice rental while we shop for a new home. The whole course of the three weeks before closing were extremely stressful and chaotic in midst of trying to find a rental that quickly and hoping things would not fall through with inspection or the sale after signing a lease and moving all our belongings.  Overall it was a very unique experience and I could not be happier. We are still searching for the right house btw.,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFI8P9JM,,0.0

I am pretty wiped out after all of the activity. I had to wake up early this morning to get onto a plane to fly across the country where I met Celia, my girlfriend. The moving truck was there waiting for me so we went straight to the apartment and got to work unloading boxes. As we worked to unpack and put things away, Celia gave me an unofficial tour of the place. It was the least of my concerns of course but I have to say, it was nice to see that the apartment is cute and comfy. I am honestly looking forward to living here full time, its a really nice place. Celia is the best, too. She made space for all of my belongings and has been being so kind and welcoming. We luckily got finished moving things in pretty fast so after a shower and a little bit of time to relax, Celia offered to take me out around the neighborhood. It was so new and different but I love how everything felt. We stopped in at some cool shops and then went for an early dinner at a nice restaurant that's just down the street from our place. I can't believe that its really ""our place"" now! Its so exciting. I just can't wait to see where our future is headed from here. After such a busy day though right now its just time to get some rest.",,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFR889JE,0.0

I mean, what is the world coming to? I digress and probably should explain what I am even thinking. So, it started about 5 months ago. There was an incident in the parking lot of my apartment complex. A young girl was murdered and it was shocking to the entire community. The police investigated the incident and managed to find two suspects that seemed to fit the events of what happened. It seems that the suspects were also accused of murdering a 17 year old girl in the same fashion about a couple of months before this one. Everyone was at ease learning that the perpetrators have been caught. However, a few months after the incident, the suspects were released. The police did not mention why or if they had any additional leads on the situation. To say the least, our community was up in arms about it. There were complaints to the police department, detective in charge and even to the mayor! It was all very confusing. Not only that, the released suspects weren't even charged in the previous incident before this one. We are all still in a state of shock over it. We are not sure what we are going to do. People are acting a little on edge now, hoping the situation doesn't happen again. Sigh...I may think about moving. I'm not sure yet. I guess I will see how the next few months unfold.",,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFR7C9JG,0.0

I came home from the movies to find my mother sitting on the sofa with a glass of wine on the coffee table, watching TV. She asked me how the gym was, as if that's something that she'd understand since she's the laziest person I know when it comes to exercise, and she sounded a little drunk. I could also smell wine from 10 feet away in the kitchen, and noticed an empty bottle on the counter. She'd drank the entire thing during the time before I left and while I was gone. She tried to ask me about my day when I realized she was totally drunk. Despite feeling great about having just worked out, my mood immediately shifted from being slightly annoyed about her having happy hour while I was away to livid about her being wasted for no apparent reason. I told her not to talk to me and she asked why; I briefly considered walking away from the situation. The anger welled up in me and I knew I had to give her a piece o my mind about what had become a disturbing habit of alcohol abuse. I raised my voice and told her it didn't matter how my day was, because she ruined it by getting excessively intoxicated when she knew it was something that greatly upset. She looked at me with an expression of confusion and sloppily said she was sorry. I yelled at her that she wasn't sorry because she kept behaving that way even though she knew how much it upset me, and it was better not to lie. I told her she was a selfish person and she had a problem, and if she was going to be a liar, she should learn to do a better job of it or just not talk to me at all. I grabbed my laptop and stormed out of the room, exiting to my bedroom. I went into my adjoining bathroom, slamming the door open so hard that it knocked the towel rack through the drywall. I looked at my angry face in the mirror and wondered why I allowed such a pathetic person to upset me so greatly. She wasn't worth it.",,30MVJZJNHNZ4G8K4PHSOC7FFQ5ZJ98,0.0

It was our first family home and we purchased it when we were newlyweds.  Now that our children are growing up, we needed more bedrooms.  We tried to make the current situation work as we are very attached to this first house.  It was a difficult decision, but after much deliberation we decided to sell it.  This happened about four months ago.  We are excited about the new house we are moving into but miss the nostalgic touches of where we reared our children in their younger days.  We miss the apple tree outside that we planted ourselves when we first moved in.  We miss the marks on the wall where we recorded their height as they grew up.  But we try and look forward to the new memories we will be creating in this new home and set our sights on the future.  This house has a dining nook where we can imagine many family pizza and movie nights going forward.  It also has a fire pit that we can imagine the kids will enjoy having their friends over at as they grow older.  It is important to never grow to attached to worldly things as nothing lasts.  It is also important to remember that although nothing lasts, nothing is lost.  The older I grow the more I realize what this truly means to me.",,30OG32W0SVXHUU26CQ02XSX70N5ENE,0.0

I've also seen the numerous depictions in film of McMurtry's stories. I first discovered the adventures of Call and McCrae in my freshman year of high school. My new girlfriend at the time (who considered herself a bit of a cowgirl) was obsessed with the series. She wasn't exaggerating to say she'd tried her hand at being a cowboy; she once joined an old fashioned cattle drive that took a herd of livestock from idaho to montana by horse. She was so taken by the series and it's characters that she even had her bicep tattooed with a full half-sleeve of McCrae rearing back on a horse. It was quite good work and I was quite jealous. I wouldn't mind going back to visit some of the timeless characters in those novels, they really do hold up in their unflinching depiction of the old american west, blemishes and all. Some of the most profound things I took from the stories were the details surrounding the cultures of the various native american tribes the cowboys encounter along the journeys. It's very interesting to know how the comanches and apaches were so desperately feared, and some other tribes simply were not as their way of life was much different. It also doesn't surprise me that plains native americans would be so tough and willing to fight to defend themselves given the overall harsh environment of north and west texas. One of the most striking moments in the series is when the long time adversary of Call and McCrae, the former chief of the comanches, is on his death-bed and seeks a personal journey to die alone and apart from his tribe. The cowboys have fought him for decades and want nothing but vengeance but they never get it. Instead the reader is treated to a profound moment of acceptance from an incredibly strong-willed man as he ushers himself from his world. It is truly one of my favorite books and having grown up in Texas, I some sense of pride imagining that events as romantic if at time brutal  probably took place. It makes me feel at the very least that Texas is as unique a state as we Texans would like to believe and often proclaim.",,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,0.0

It is difficult to even come up with a single favorite book but I did in this case. I liked it so much , maybe because at 59, I am aging and related well to the characters.  I am also a Texan.  Lonesome Dove is about two aging ex-Texas Rangers that feel the need to have one last great adventure.  This last adventure takes the form of a cattle drive from south Texas north to Montana (if memory serves me well).  There are many other characters involved with different backgrounds that could very well have books of their own.  The adventures abound and there really isn't a dull moment in the entire book.  Larry McMurtry excels at character development to the point that I felt as though I knew them.  He also excels at plots and sub-plots that are very compelling. While it isn't ""War and Peace"" long, it is a rather long book but I wished it was longer when I finished it.  I was very sad when I finished reading Lonesome Dove.  It was like losing a playmate, maybe even a friend.  I wondered what I was going to do for reading next.  I ended up researching similar books written by Larry McMurtry.  I did find other similar books that were written about the western United State at around the same time period but it just didn't match the colorful characters in Lonesome Dove. Maybe it was because I was born in the panhandle of Texas, my dad was a real cowboy and I could relate better to many of the things mentioned in the book.  As such the others paled in comparison.",30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,30X31N5D64CBKUDZ4HF203HMQFJASZ,0.0

The first family vacation we'd taken as a family of four (plus the in-laws).  We'd invited my in-laws to join us an extra set of eyes to help keep an eye on the girls while we went to the beach (you never know when one of them is going to want to run off and we didn't want anyone alone in or near the water). Not only was this our first family vacation as a family of four, but it was to the beach. The girls had never been to the beach before. We went to The Outer Banks, or OBX as the locals and annual visitors call it. We were so excited to see the expression on our 1 yr old and 2 yr old faces; would it be joy or even possibly fear that they'd express . Shockingly the girls aren't as much of a fan of the beach as their mother is. The response of our 2 yr old as she first stepped into the sand "" ew, yuck so dirty!"" was a laugh for all of us but it should have also been a sign as to how they would like or dislike the beach. What kid doesn't enjoy getting a little dirty or at least one would normally think. But not our girls. We didn't last more than 30 minutes building sand castles and standing on the sand as the waves washed over our feet. They'd talk about going to the beach but as soon as we'd get there, they'd be bored or tired of walking on the sand. Although the beach itself didn't go over as well as we'd anticipated, at least the girls enjoyed getting away and ""seeing"" the beach from a distance. And at least we got pictures we can look back at...however short the time was. And the memories....oh the memories we created were priceless. Our first family vacation may not have gone over as well as we anticipated, but we all had a great time relaxing and enjoying time together. That's what matters anyway.",,317HQ483I8ETAZ4S89QTI7VZSBNINS,0.0

Randy, one of my coworkers has been having a really hard time. There had always been rumors that he was a heavy drinker, but I never payed much attention to them. Then he came into work looking destroyed and being extra quiet. I asked him what's up and he just broke down. He said his family had asked him to move out because he had lost control of his drinking. He didn't know what to do. I talked to him a bit and calmed him down, then gave his a number of a rehab clinic that my brother went to. He checked in himself and our boss gave him some time off to get sorted. The rehab program was less than a month and I'm not sure exactly what the program is, but it seemed to help. He came back like a different person. He went back to his wife and apologized and told them he wanted to change. She said she wanted to help him and welcomed him back.

My bladder was irritated and just stopped working. I couldn’t pee no matter how hard I tried. I was truly the most miserable I’ve ever been. I finally couldn’t stand it anymore so my mom and boyfriend took me back to the hospital and I FINALLY got admitted!! :D I guess all those crazy contractions worked because I finally dilated to 3cm and they admitted me! (After threatening their lives if they didn’t lol) so here I am, on my due date, CRAZY happy with my epidural, and waiting to progress. Right now I’m about 5-6cm. Can’t wait to meet my little boy!

It was an open-handed, angry slap on the face. Followed by frozen shared-shock. It all started when we were arguing over who should be doing what tasks around the apartment. I was living with her for a few months until I could get on my feet, because I was new to the city. And at a distance, with enough time between interactions- the bossy, assured nature she would dictate our time together in, was almost a comfort. I really liked having her be that for us, and I think she really enjoyed having me being compliant and helpful. But when a few times a month became everyday, the tension began to build. Perhaps I would offer to take the dogs out a few days she was busy getting ready in the morning. Then the next week she would ask me every day to take her dogs out and to also feed them. When the clothes sitting in the washer were blocking me from doing my laundry, I would go ahead and finish out her loads of laundry. Then the next week she would ask me to do her laundry for her. It would even be things that weren't house care related. If she didn't want to be alone doing something, she would ask me to accompany her to do it-perhaps watching her hang up her clothes, or sit with her while she studied. Well one particular night it came to a head when she asked me to come help her clean up the kitchen. I had not dirtied up the kitchen, and I didn't want to clean it up. And when she would ask for help doing something-you can bet that meant I was just going to do most if not all of it, and she absolutely used that to her advantage. But this night, I said no. She was so taken aback by this that she got angry with me. I was so offended that she would get mad that I declined to help on this ONE thing that it escalated quickly over the next 40 minutes. We started kitchen-sinking, mudslinging, slandering, defaming each other just specifically calling out every minuscule problem we had with each other over the past month. Until eventually we got up in each other's faces and she slapped me across the face. It's been about 4 months since then, and we still haven't spoken. I just hope that one day we can get past this, because it breaks my heart that such a stupid beginning of a fight has ended in more serious sadness.",,3180JW2OT5YLFLISMRF70RADE7HJ5O,0.0

They decided to focus on unnecessary drama.  I have apologized to my son. He said that it is all right, but I do not agree.

I haven't written here in a while because I've been preoccupied with my illness, but it seems like it's completely gone!  And it's all thanks to cheese! About 2 months ago I was suffering from chronic migraines.  I had one almost every day.  Then I read about a certain kind of fungus in a special kind of cheese that was reported to have medicinal effects.  This fungus supposedly could reduce--even eliminate--the occurrence of migraine headaches.  Luckily I love cheese.  And the only place that carried this strange cheese was Costco.  So I got a trial membership and bought pounds of the stuff.  I ate some everyday.  Actually, a lot.  Because it was delicious.  It seemed to work almost immediately.  The first week of eating the cheese daily I had only 2 short migraines.  The second through fourth week, one a week.  The fifth to eighth week I had only 2 migraines.

In my eulogy I spoke how the day that I find out I would be a father would be one of the toughest days for me.  That would be because I wouldn't be able to call him and see his excitement.  I wouldn't be able to call him for advice.  My wife is now about 6 months pregnant.  Still to this day I have highs and lows because of these two things.  Highs because I am so excited to be a dad.  Lows because I don't have my dad here to help me.  We found out we are having a girl!  I always thought I wanted a boy first, but when I found out we were having a girl I was so ecstatic.  I immediately went into papa bear mode.  I began looking into how to be the best dad to a girl.  What I needed to know about having a girl.

The cats look out it and look a birds or other things going on there. When I asked him about parking there he kind of shrugged it off and let me know he had no intention of not parking there anymore. So I made a decision to go buy a birdbath and put it in front of that window on my area of property. I purchased the birdbath. It was huge. Weighed about 100lbs. I killed my back lifting it into the cart. I hurt my back so badly I could not get it out of the cart and into my car. I had to have someone from the store do it for me. I asked my neighbor to please move his truck sometime that week so that I could install the birdbath. He got furious, started going off about property lines and blah blah blah.  I remained calmed and I showed him the property line and said nicely, didnt mean to upset you, I just want to install a birdbath on my property in front of my cat window. So with the help of my roommates walker with a seat on it, I was able to move the heavy birdbath from car to where I was putting it in. I was suprised at how smoothly that went.

My journey started with the abdominal pain and has now lead me to treatment for infertility with some amazing doctors.  I had been having abdominal pain for years and was told by three different doctors that I just had scar tissue from a previous surgery and it would probably get better. Needless to say,  it only got worse.  I had to go for surgery for an infection in my abdominal wall which ended up being not infection, just inflammation from the endometriosis.  They did a biopsy of a ""mass"" as the doctor called it, which ended up being endometriosis.  With this new diagnosis, I then knew why I have been unable to have kids and that was for sure the reason I hurt almost constantly for the past several years. Finally in May I was able to start the fertility treatments. I was so excited and overwhelmed. That now give me the hope that one day I will possibly be having my own little baby.  It has been a trying time and for sure a very emotional one. The hormones make me feel, at times, that I am going to go crazy,  but in the long run I know it will be well worth the wait. I have an enormous support system. My doctors, friends, family and my boyfriend have been by my side the whole time since I have started with the fertility specialists.  The pills I take are usually not that bad on me,  however the shot that I have to take is what really gets me.  I have to stick myself in the belly with a NEEDLE!! I never saw myself being able to do that. The shot leaves a small red spot around where I take it and it is a little sore for several days. We have already finished three rounds of the medication and shots only.  I think we are going to try and start IUI/IVF in the next few months to give us a greater chance of having a baby.  I know that it will help me to increase my chances of pregnancy. Hopefully in the next year we will be welcoming our own little baby into this world.

After the test we had a chat with the doctor. The doctor said he could not really tell us what was going on and we were directed to see a specialist. We met with the specialist and he said he would have to run some test. After the test came the news, the doctor said he suspect it might be cancer.

We drove for about six and a half hours to drop her off.  It was a big day for everyone.  I was so happy and excited for her.  Of course, I was a little sad at the same time.  I know I will miss her a whole lot.  Once at the university, we were just so proud.  We saw many parents with their children on campus.  It was a little chaotic, but still well organized.  The upper classmates helped with the moving of the freshmen.  We tried to decorate her dorm room with the stuff that reminded her of home.  My daughter and her new roommate were happy to finally meet each other.  The whole day went by so fast.  When it was time to say goodbye, I tried to put on a happy face.  In the end, I could not help being emotional. What I remembered the most about that day is what my daughter did for us.  She had parting gifts for all of us.  She wrote each of us a letter.

We had friends over and some more family over as well. The bwat part of the day is when they brung out the liquor and we drank and talked more crap about our childhood. Me and my cousin was together all the time but as we gotten older we did not spend as much time together. But now that we had this party it made us a lot closer. My girlfriend had a great dinner set up as well. She made pasta garlic bread and brought chips and dip. We were crushing all of that foos. When they brung out thw cake we were so happy.

I got a new nintendo switch that day and so did my cousin, with the same game. The new pokemon game that came out that year. It was trully special because I have been wanting it for years and I finally gotten it. We played for hours and even had to take a break.  I will never forget those moments as me and my cousin played side by side for hours on a day between our birthdays. We trully felt like we shared those moments. We caught pokemon that was different then eachothers and we battled them as we caught new ones. We just simply linked our gameboys and played agianst eachother. People at the party were watching us and even rooting for me and my cousin as we had intense matches that day. All lower level pokemons. Me and my cousins are some big time fans of pokemon.

In total, we visited 5 parks and 3 major cities. We were supposed to visit 6 parks, but one day got rained out and we had to skip it. Our trip started in Ohio. The first park was called holiday world and was in Santa Clause Indiana. Next, we went to Kentucky Kingdom in Louisville, Kentucky. After this, we were supposed to go to Dollywood, but the rain canceled it. Our next park was Carowinds, just outside Charlotte North Carolina. We were there long enough for a day in the park and the city. After this, we went to Kings Dominion in Doswell Virginia. They have a coaster that pulls so many G's everyone blacks out or gets close to it. After a day here, we visited Philadelphia. We spent a night and day in the city. We toured around the sites and ate plenty of Cheesesteaks and Dinic's roasted pork sandwiches. Our final stop was Toronto and Canada's Wonderland just outside the city. We spent three days. This was we made sure to take in as much as the city had to offer. We also stopped on the way there to see Niagara Falls. I had never seen it from the Canadian side.

Three weeks ago I took a trip to Budapest, Hungary with one of my childhood best friends. I was already in Europe because I had been working in Madrid, Spain. I took a short flight, and met met my friend in Hungary. She was pretty jet lagged since she came from the United States but we went out for dinner that night. We were absolutely blown away with how delicious Hungarian food is. We had delicious stew and soup. I was worried initially about how the food would be. I do not eat meat, and I read prior that Hungarians love their meat, but I had no trouble finding vegetarian options. The next day on our trip, we saw the beautiful Parliament building, and a beautiful castle. I remember walking up many stairs and getting tired in the hot, summer sun. Suddenly though, we reached an archway that took us to the end of the tunnel. There was sunlight peaking through and some of the most beautiful architecture I had ever seen. I saw beautiful mosaics, and a cobblestone square that overlooked the entire city of Budapest. Perfectly situated was a bar where we could sit down and look out at the view of the city and parliament building on the other side of the water. It was absolutely breathtaking and my favorite part of the trip. A close second for my favorite part of the trip was a sunset boat ride we took that allowed us to later see the lit up buildings at night. We finished our last day of the trip with going to the famous baths. It was perfect timing to relax after having walked many miles the days before. The baths are said to have healing qualities, but regardless, I found them very relaxing.  This trip was amazing overall, I really enjoyed sharing an international experience with one of my best friends. I hadn't seen her for almost a year so it was really great to catch up and kind of share with her a little bit of my chaotic life of when I was working in Europe.",326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD37FED1,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLD37FED1,0.0

I wanted to go somewhere less touristy and with more culture, but Tom has wanted to visit the Bahamas ever since his best friend Alex went with her husband. I acquiesced, of course, because I'll do anything to make Tom happy. And he was. He was in Heaven for that entire week. And so, I was pleasantly surprised to find out, was I.The resort was the most luxurious accommodation I have ever experienced. We didn't have to lift a finger for the whole week. New drinks were brought to us at the moment our glasses had become dry. The beach and the water were so beautiful. The water was a vivid turquoise color, just like you see in the commercials. The weather was perfect except for one day, when it rained hard. Tom and I used that time to go to a local cultural museum, which I felt right at home at. I enjoyed learning about the history of the Bahamian people. There were several events that we enjoyed participating in during our stay. Every night there was a dinner where you could eat with other couples. We made these wonderful friends, Jim and Sue, who were our companions throughout the trip. My favorite events were the late night parties. There was dancing under the light of the fire from the tiki torches. The DJ was talented and played a great mix of music, including hits and deep cuts. Everyone was in a cheerful mood, and I found it contagious. My favorite event was the carnival that we attended a few miles away from the resort. There were so many elaborate costumes, amazing food, and live music. Coming home from the trip, I felt utterly relaxed and rejuvenated. I will cherish the memories from this trip forever.",,326O153BMJK88IBTNWMZ1NLDA1CDES,0.0

We found some huge rocks we could swim around and look at all the colorful fish.  We also rented four wheeler and got to ride them all around the island. While riding up very high we could look down on all the boats surrounding the island. We got great tans and had some delicious meals. A lot of great seafood! The shopping was unique as we found some great gifts to bring back and my husband found some nice shirts he liked. We did the town and shops their with gold, silver, rings necklaces just about anything you would be looking for.  We took a lot of pictures and video and have enjoy watching them. They have brought back fond memories. We have enjoyed showing them to our friends and family! We can't wait to go back. There is so much to see and do!

I was really going though during that time in my life. drugs and alcohol were something that I used everyday to try and feel something or feel better in my life. I eventually realized that taking these things weren't really helping me at all. They were making things worse for me in my body and in my mind. I had to get help so I signed up for alcoholic and narcotics meetings. I attended them everyday once I had gotten together. I never missed a day for about two years. One day there was a meeting for me in which to celebrate my success of not missing any days and being cleaned up. I was finally sober for a good little while now and it felt good. I had recieved a two year token for doing just that. The people had a mini party for me to celebrate. I really enjoyed be able to have fun without being intoxicated.

When I attended her funeral, I immediately broke down. The room was fill not only with many family members, but all of her friends, old teachers, and sports buddies.

Six of the longest months of my life. It’s taken a long time for me to come to grips with what’s transpired, but I feel I am finally ready to put it into words. I remember it was beautiful that day. I was at work wishing I wasn’t. Imagine my surprise when the line shut down and they sent us all home. I thought I’d surprise Linda by showing up home early. I was the one with the surprise of my life. I knew something was up when I walked in. Linda was sitting on the couch and shed obviously been crying. I asked, and she told me she’d been having an affair with our friend Steve. I left on the spot. In hindsight, I should’ve taken Ralphie with me. But I just wanted to get out of there. Instead, she went down to the courts the next day and filed for custody. It took five months to settle this stupid custody mess. And in the meanwhile, I’ve spent my entire savings. $23,000 cash. I think the lawyer might have done me dirtier than my ex in some ways. I’m not sure if I’ll ever recover financially. Thought about ending it a couple times too. I’m glad I talked myself down. Funny how things work in the end. I may be broke, but at least I have my kiddo. Here’s to a fresh start!",,32AT8R96GMVVZ3RXAMWT04TG9C2SUK,0.0

As we had never been there before, we were both very excited about the vacation. We packed up the car with our camping gear, put the dog in a kennel and we were off. We arrived in Washington after about 15 hours of non-stop driving. When we arrived in Seattle, the first thing we saw was Mt. Rainier. My wife and I laughed because it reminded us of our first date together in college. We ended up going to a frat party, where they were drinking Rainier beer. It had a drawing of Rainier on the logo. Anyway, when we arrived at the campground, we were absolutely struck by how beautiful the national park was. We were going to be hiking a very long trail the next day, so we quickly set up the tent and got our campsite squared away. My wife, who hadn't been camping very often, was a little bit skittish about the signs we had seen warning of bears. Every time a twig snapped or the wind blew our tent flaps against the tent walls, she started in fright. Eventually, we both drifted off to sleep after the long drive. The next morning, we secured our campsite and headed off to begin our 5 mile hike. We packed food and water and started up the trail. There were dark clouds in the horizon, and I commented that we might be in for rain. But my wife thought it'd be okay to continue. It never did rain and we had a wonderful hike. Overall, our first vacation to Washington state was a huge success and we look forward to returning some day.",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WK1U9MW,0.0

We weren't going to stay in Seattle, but really get out in the wilderness for this vacation. So we drove out to Washington and made our way out into the back country. We wanted to first go hiking and camping at Olympic National park. We were hoping the weather would be nice and that we wouldn't have any trouble. The weather did turn out nice and we made our way hiking into the park. There were many interesting paths around the park and we got to see many amazing sites. The mountains, forests, streams and odd bit of wildlife all added to how awed we were by it all. We were having such a good time, instead of moving off toward other parks, we spent an extra day at the park. Once we had packed up our camping gear we went on with the rest of the trip. We left to do the other half of our trip plan, which was mostly driving and exploring. We drive around the state seeing all that we could see and remaining floored by the beauty. Unfortunately the weather turned to rain during this part of our trip, but we powered through. We wish that we could have had more time out there, but we had to come home. It ended up being one of our best trips.",,32KTQ2V7RE1UHGQPSE5GSZ7WK1U9MW,0.0

Once we checked in we decided to go to the lobby bar for a drink. We then took our drinks into the van and the van took us to our rooms. After leaving our bags in our hotel rooms we then went to eat lunch at the buffet. It was the first time that my wife went to an all you can eat buffet. At first she was skeptical but then she said she enjoyed the food and how it was set up. We then went to to the pool area where there was a snack and drink bar with all you can eat snacks as well. We enjoyed our time there and swimming there was a blast. Afterwards we went to the night entertainment. It was there that we saw the different shows for kids and grown ups. I was able to get more drinks from that bar and bring it to her and the family. The next day we had alot of fun doing all the other activities.,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM275AGIJ,,0.0

It was a Sandals resort and everything was included such as drinks, food, and sleeping arrangements. We went for her birthday because she had never been out of the country and always wanted to. On the first day, we decided to just relax a bit and drink on the beach. It was a lot of fun because we could just talk together. I have never been able to spend that much alone time with my wife because we are constantly hanging out with our children. It was very nice to be able to get away. As the vacation went on we decided we wanted to do some sort of physical activity. We did a high ropes course right off the beach that made me a bit nervous, but that my wife loved it. I don't like heights that much and many objects were swinging at a high height. I was able to jump from space to space, but often would fall and dangle from the top. We also decided to go on a quick cruise that took us out at sunset to watch some dolphins swimming in the ocean. The sunset was absolutely beautiful and we didn't see many dolphins, but the company from being next to my wife was the best. Almost every night we would go dancing too. There was a bar that had a huge dance floor and lots of people would come out and we would all just dance together and chill. It was great to be with my wife, but also be surrounded by other people. We didn't want this vacation to end, but eventually we had to leave and return to our kids so we had to. I wouldn't trade this trip for the world.",,32M8BPYGAU8N07N6L5DYSNM275AGIJ,0.0

The team was late for the game as our bus was stuck in the busy Long Beach traffic of the early summer. The weather was light and gray and it was the kind of day where you wake up sleepy no matter the amount of hours that you slept the night before. The team had been thrilled to be here in the first place. We were subpar team the year before and all of a sudden we were at the top of our game being able to compete with the best teams in the district. I had spent the night before just watching old dodger games trying to get pitching tips from the great Hideo Nomo. I was raised watching him and wanted to pitch just like him. My coaches told me otherwise though and let me know it is not a good thing because it hurts your back in the long run. We had arrived at Milikan Park. I didn't want to get off the bus as I was nervous as can be. We went in the locker rooms and I dressed up and was ready to pitch. We got on the field and surprisingly the stands were half empty. I was told that the fans weren't being let in because of a riot that happened there. Once the stands filled up I was up to pitch at the top of the 1st inning. I got on the mound. Surprisingly I was ready. I struck out the side in the first inning. I feel like overall my past history of failures lead me this inning and the rest of the game. I was tired of failing at all I tried and I wanted something new for a change. At the bottom of the ninth we were down 3-2 as the relief pitcher had let in 3 runs at the top of the inning. We managed to battle back and win it off a two run blast by my childhood friend Jim. It was what we used to dream of as kids. Winning anything together. It didn't happen in the pros but it felt like it did. We never made it to the majors, so this is the best memory I have of the game of baseball and it happened 3 months ago.",32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3MTFEK6,32Q90QCQ1T7GMOH3FD8M50G3MTFEK6,0.0

It's not often that I completely embarrass myself in front of all my coworkers, but I definitely succeeded in doing that this past holiday season. About 6 weeks ago I went to a backyard cookout hosted by Mike. When I got there, Mike surprised me by asking me to watch his son during the cookout. I was pretty surprised because I didn't think Mike trusted me that much, but I guess he felt comfortable asking me because he knew I was a parent too. As the cookout started, I began talking to Mike's son and trying to entertain him. It was difficult to keep up with his energy, because he was 7 years old. Kids at that age seem to just have endless amounts of energy and always talk so fast it's hard to get a word in. After about a half hour of talking to his son, I was starting to get a bit bored and stressed. I decided to sneak a beer from the cooler without telling Mike. When I was finished drinking, I felt a lot more at ease and I wasn't getting stressed as much at the task of being responsible for Mike's son. I said to myself, what the heck, and decided to have a few more beers. By the third beer, things were getting a bit out of control. I don't remember doing this exactly, but according to my other co-workers, I took my shirt off and was running around the backyard pretending to be a unicorn by sticking the can of beer to my forehead and pretending it was my horn I guess. While my coworkers were not amused, Mike's son and all the other kids at the cookout were laughing hysterically at my crazy antics. Unfortunately, I didn't get to taste the burgers that Mike was cooking up the whole time as he unsurprisingly kicked me out. At least I didn't lose my job.",,32SCWG5HIIQDK0L4MNUWPTAP7C5P6R,0.0

It was the first time that my husband and I had taken our little ones on a long trip. We only went about four hours from home, but it felt like we were a world away! The car ride went more smoothly than I thought it would with a baby in the car. Granted, we did leave in the early hours of the morning, so the kids slept for a little while. We stayed in a community of rental homes in a very nice neighborhood. The house was beautiful and it met all of our needs for the trip. There was also a huge lagoon style pool on the property that we made use of during our stay. The kids had a blast swimming in it. I think the most exciting part of our trip was seeing our little girl (3) at the beach for the first time. She was just in awe of everything. She kept running down to the water and running back across the sand, and her excitement was just infectious. It means a lot to me that we are able to take our kids to do things like this and have fun experiences, because I know a lot of people are not so lucky. We are not rich by any means, but as long as we can give our kids love and a taste of life, I am happy. It filled my heart to see her so enjoying herself. On the whole, it was a great trip full of fun experiences. It was hard to deal with the toddlers, but all of the frustrations were worth it.",32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,,0.0

My husband and I went with my brother, sister-in-law, their nineteen month old, and our two kids, who are 15 months and 3. It was QUITE an experience. We stayed in a lovely rental house in Rosemary Beach, about an hour from Destin. The drive was not too bad, about five hours from our home, but it was long enough with small children in the car. I was nervous about this trip because it was our first family vacation and I have a hard time managing my two strong-willed children, especially when they are together. Sure enough, by Day 2 I was exhausted. I had to carry my youngest on my hip probably ninety percent of the time, even including when we were at home. He woke up at 5:30 AM every morning, so I was forced to do so as well. We engaged in a variety of activities including souvenir shopping, visiting the community pool, going to the beach, and watching a bottlenose dolphin show at an aquarium. Probably my favorite thing we did was go to a natural spring that wasn't far from where we were staying. The water was a beautiful aquamarine and clear as it could be. The only problem was it was COLD! We had a blast wading and swimming a bit, and just enjoying the beautiful scenery. Although it was hard to keep both kids organized and happy, it was a memorable experience and one that I'll not soon forget. It was wonderful to have time to spend with them and also with my brother and his family. They are very dear to us.",32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,32SVAV9L3GV70DSKE2E1SV9AZ393AY,0.0

It had the number of rooms that I wanted and it was in a condition (aesthetically) that I loved. By this I mean that certain rooms like the kitchen and bathroom were up-to-date and I didn't have to do much to fix these places to be more to my liking. Because the house was so beautiful, I decided to get the works with it - I invested in a gate, a few security cameras and have a subscription to ADT to make sure that everything is protected. To be honest, all of these things make em feel very safe. It is in a great neighborhood where I know all of the people who live in the community and even the association people are friendly and nice to all of us that live here. The most memorable thing that I recall in this house is finding it to begin with. Before getting this house, there was a period of time in my life where I was deeply into the movies that centered around beautiful natural phenomena, like red tide or the aurora borealis. After praying that I could find someplace good to live with all the bells and whistles I wanted, I went onto Zillow to find my prefect place. I found a place, someplace gorgeous that had all the amenities I was looking for at a price I loved. In a good area, I deigned to look at what the street was called and lo and behold the house was on Aurora Lane. I knew this house was meant for me and it showed that my religion always comes though for me. I do believe there is a God up there and this experience has shown me that it is indeed the case, the way things matched up so surprisingly nicely and personally to me. I wish someone else could have an experience like mine because I loved how it all went about. Fast forward to today and I have worked on many areas to improve the way the house looks and it is even more to how I prefer it.",,32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQ507R47,0.0

She was a sweet, gentle soul; could almost pass for an angel. Chatting with her felt like a bliss, we could almost relate on anything. There were lots of topics to talk about, chit chats about our past memories in school; it really gave us things to smile and laugh about. Our discussions at the early stages were a bit friendly nothing intimate, but as days passed it got more intimate and romantic. We got to know our favorite colors, food, hobbies, future plans and basically everything about us. We never saw physically but emotionally we were very close to each other. Video calls helped a lot, in terms of reducing our tension, nervous nature and early shyness that happens in almost all relationships. After about a month, we decided to fix a date when we could see. We chose an nice restaurant to meet, which was not quite far from us both. Finally, we met and all I can say is, she was the most beautiful girl my eyes has ever seen. Never knew one could be so perfect, her smiles were genuine and flawless. There was just something about the way she carried herself, you could tell she was very confident in her skin. Our conversation never changed, it was as if we were old friends who just met after a long time. The attraction was there, none of us could even deny it; there and then, I told her my intentions. From that day till now, the relationship has been a bliss; we match well in almost all aspects and would love to spend the rest of my life with her.",,32VNZTT0A8QKHQX5GR56XQQQOR9R4A,0.0

He had never planned a vacation without me so I was very shocked but excited.  Neither of us had ever been to Disney world before so it would be a first for both of us.  The day started out hitting up some of the rides.  Mid day we were both a little tired so we went back to the hotel to rest up and shower.  He had made dinner plans for us that evening.  We both rested and got cleaned up and then headed back to the park.  He had made reservations near Cinderella's castle so that we could watch the fireworks as we ate.  It was so beautiful and romantic to see the fireworks light up the castle.  As dinner was wrapping up the waiter came out with two glasses of champagne.  I was so caught up in watching the fireworks that I failed to notice that my boyfriend was now down on one knee.  I couldn't believe what was happening!  My mind was whirling as I screamed out yes!  I jumped up to hug my boyfriend.  The next thing I know I hear some familiar voices calling out congratulations behind me.  I turned around to see my two best friends behind me.  My boyfriend had flown in my two sisters so they could be hear to celebrate with us.  That had to be the most memorable part of the evening seeing them.  I couldn't believe that he planned this whole romantic evening himself.  I also couldn't believe that my sister's kept this secret from me.  I just thought I was taking a simple weekend getaway with my boyfriend.  I never had a clue that I would head home two days later engaged to be married. This was definitely the most romantic thing my boyfriend has ever done for me.,,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTNM2Q,0.0

I'm 50 years old and have the 3 most amazing children in the world. Their ages are 25, 19 and 20 ( almost 21). Two boys and a girl (the youngest). I spent the vast majority of  the last half of my life caring for my children. Now that they are older, I was excited to explore and excel in my professional career. My professional background is Healthcare Operations/Revenue Cycle Management. I Have managed Doctor offices, Hospital departments, taught Medical Billing and Coding, etc. This career path began in 1996. However, I needed a change in my career path therefore I started working for a behavioral health software company in about three years ago. Little did I know how this job would impact my life. At first, it was very exciting as I was travelling a lot. This was the  most memorable and exciting aspect of the job. I was able to go to states that I would've never dreamed of traveling to. Unfortunately, to my greatest surprise, there were more projects then the staff to handle. everyone on my team were overloaded with work. The standard was 4 projects at a time. But due to the overload, I was given 6-8 projects back to back. I started overworking myself to meet project deadline. The more I did that the more my health declined. I keep pushing myself more and more because I really liked the implementation and project management aspect of my career path. unfortunately, I became more and more ill and I could no longer meet deadlines. Therefore, I was laid off and had to find another career path with less stress. While recovering from my illness, my financial struggle was real. I nearly lost my home, my car, etc, so thank God for my amazing family and friends that I am able to bounce back.",,32XVDSJFP0JJHW5Q75Q1ICZIOTI2M1,0.0

This was very exciting for me because this is my first close friend to have a child while I have two already and another that is due soon. Because we have been so busy since adulthood, her with work, and me being a mom, working, and going to school, it was a great opportunity to get together. My daughter was especially excited because she was really wanting the new baby to be a girl, but it is not. She has that opportunity to spend time with a baby girl. Even though they are not actually family, me and my friend have always been so close that the kids will be raised more like cousins than friends. I also got to see her family for the first time in a while which was nice. It felt like 'coming home.' This family is one that I have spent many holidays with over the years, including major holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas that you typically spend with family. There were no other friends of the family at the party, it was only family members and that made me feel quite warm. It also was the first time I got to see my friends new house. She had been living with her spouse and baby at her mom's house since she was pregnant and it was very exciting to see them moving out and being more independent. While I love her family, it is always good to have your own space as an adult. I really look forward to our kids growing up together and couldn't be happier still.

I noticed if I was in the center of the lane.  I noticed if I was too far right or too far left.  I tried to stay in the middle of the traveling lane as much as possible.

I would have written about it sooner, but I needed time to process my thoughts about the event, because it was somewhat traumatic.  Now that some time has passed, I think I have enough perspective to talk about it and express how I feel. Three months ago, I wrecked my beautiful truck.  I was coming home from work after the late shift, and it was raining.  I was going down New Road  about 11pm.  I rounded a corner, and there were four deer in the road.  I know right, my greatest fear when driving home at night.  I swerved to miss the deer, which I did successfully, but I went into a spin on the slick wet road.  I slid completely off the roadway and ran into a tree.   Fortunately, I had my seat belt on, because I hit the tree head on.  The airbags deployed and the seat belt did it's job, and I was only shaken up.  The truck was completely totaled and I was so upset about this.  I worked so hard for that truck and I just couldn't believe that God would let this happen to me.   I was upset for weeks.  The insurance did replace the truck, but it just wasn't the same. Now, after several weeks have passed, I realized how ungrateful I was in being upset about the truck.  The important thing is that I walked away completely unhurt.  Not even a scratch.   Trucks you can replace, but I was really fortunate that night. I am going to make a huge effort in the future to be grateful for the important things in life, and care less about the material things.",,32Z9ZLUT1M6BWPTK368LXKUP9EPHOS,0.0

My brother looked at him and told him that he knows when it's okay to quit drinking.  I know he didn't mean anything by it, but the waiter was horrified.

My parents saw to it that I had a lot of great times to look back on and cherish. In the spirit of that, I wanted to pass on experiences like this to my daughter. This weekend, I decided to take a step forward to do that and bought a projector for my daughter. This projector will enable us to watch movies using a large screen or an empty wall. So, this weekend, I decided to set up a backyard movie night. I took the deck furniture and arranged it on the lawn to look like a living room. Then, I spread a moving blanket down to give us a clean area to walk. I set up a card table with the projector and DVD player along with the appropriate cords. I then put the screen together and anchored it to the ground using stakes. The screen was up against the side of the house to protect it from the wind. I tested the projector on the screen and it looked amazing. The sound quality was even good as well. Once I had everything set up, we popped some popcorn and got snacks. Finally, we told our daughter and she was super excited. She ran out to the yard and her face lit up as we all gathered around and watched Secret Life of Pets 2. It was an amazing night and I'm so glad I did it.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U95QM58,0.0

Everyone at work was sad to see me go and I knew it was going to be tough leaving work because I had developed special bonds with many coworkers since I had a couple of decades working there. I thought it was going to be tough spending more time at home than at work and that eventually I would get bored and want to go back to work, so I left my position with the option of coming back if I had ever decided to. As five months have passed since my retirement I never thought I would be enjoying living my life without the pressures of the job I loved doing for so many years. I am truly enjoying every moment of my retirement and I don't plan on doing any work for the time present. I love that I am able to see my granddaughter grow up and give her the time I always wanted to but previously was so busy to do. We have the greatest time together because she such a sweet little girl and I have had the opportunity to care for her four days out of the week while her parents work. I am also able to do that for my daughter so she could go to work knowing that her daughter is in the best hands. I love my life right now and I would not trade it for nothing. I also was able to pick up my old hobby of painting and this all happened just one afternoon when I was cleaning out my attic and I found all of my old paintings. I relived the joy I had as I painted them as an adolescent and I decided I would pick up the hobby once more. It was tough to get back into it but once I had started painting again, I rediscovered why I loved it so much. I am even teaching my granddaughter to paint and she loves it also. It is a great bonding time with her that I would not have had if I had not retired. I truly feel as if I am living my life as I should at this moment and I do not regret my decision to retire as difficult as it was in the beginning since I am so used to be active. I like the moments I am living with my family, I like that I am able to slow down, I like to know that I have the world as my oyster and most importantly I like to know that I am developing so many memories with all of my loved ones.",,336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U839M5M,0.0

I retired from full time employment at the end march; my sources of income now are my pension , my social security, and my m-turk work.  i am living a life now that i have never lived before.  i compare my situation, although not totally comparable, but to a prisoner who gets out of jail.  for forty years i worked at jobs that i didn't enjoy and/or were low paying, i was doing work that was too difficult for me; was unstable, etc.  so when i retired, it was like starting a new life. i thought i'd like my ""new life,"" but the fact is i love it; things are too good to be true.  not only don't i have to work anymore, but i get to spend four full days a week with my wonderful 2 year old granddaughter, Kinsley.  this is because my wife runs a small day care center right here in our house so Kinsley spends eight full hours here four days a week.  I can not express in words how much i love Kinsley.  I have one daughter but when she was young i was very distracted with a few problems that involved my job as well as some personal issues.  i didn't spend nearly as much time with my daughter as i wish i had when she was very young.  Spending all this time with my granddaughter, therefore, is a whole new experience.  watching her grow; being amazed as she does new things almost every day...amazing.  every grandparent brags about how smart their grandchildren are so i'll do the same...Kinsley is so intelligent that it almost scares me.  and she is so happy! and no wonder with loving relatives around her all the time.  besides all this, as a person who had suffered from insomnia for many years, the fact that i can now sleep when i want, with no pressure of alarm clocks or whether i got adequate sleep, it is amazing that i have no more of those pressures.  i hardly even need an alarm clock.  i don't have to worry about whether a job can provide coverage if i  want to call in sick.  i don't have to worry about driving in bad weather as i had to so often in the winter here in central new york state where we sometimes get pounded with snow storms.  i also love listening to my CDs and i recently became a frank sinatra fan; better late than never.  and i enjoy the company of my wonderful, supportive wife.  so all in all, things are great.  i paid 40 years worth of dues and i earned my freedom.",336YQZE83W0BGTODPOSZGJ2U839M5M,,0.0

We loaded up both of our cars with all of his things and headed to his college which was 3 hours away.  This is our first child leaving for college so it is stressful, expensive and just sad.  It was even worse for me as my car's check engine light came on while we were driving him down. I had to say my goodbyes in a gas station parking lot which was less than ideal.  We managed to fit all of his stuff except his bike into one car and I drove back home in case something major was wrong with the car.  My wife finished driving him to school to unload all of his stuff.  My oldest daughter went with them to help but we didn't have room in that car for my younger daughter who I drove home.  I didn't even get to see his dorm room or campus or anything.  I miss him a lot as everything just seems different now that he is gone.  I text him regularly but it certainly isn't the same as seeing him all of the time.  He is coming back to visit on labor day so at least we have that going for us.  The car had some sort of electrical problem causing it to misfire, $800 later it is fixed.  My wife drove his bike down a week later.  The entire reason we took him to college early was for band camp.  He got accepted to the band but decided he didn't want to do it so turned them down.  Wish we had just waited 2 more weeks to move him in.",338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKH5LAHZ,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKH5LAHZ,0.0

At first, the symptoms were easy to miss. She would forget where her purse was or where the remote was. Then they became more obvious.  Making the same thing for dinner two days in a row having forgotten she made that meal yesterday and then the sadness in her face when she is shown the leftovers from the previous day.  I think Mom was realizing it and trying so hard to fight the symptoms.  We went to the doctor who referred us to a specialist. The specialist prescribed medication and occupational therapy. While her symptoms are mild for the moment, she fixates on losing her quality of life. She worries about becoming a burden to us and also of being alone.  For me, I spend my time reassuring her while also researching the details of the disease. My kids do not know yet, and I stress about when and what to tell them.  My brother has found support groups that can help navigate the progression of the illness. For the time being, Mom is still living with Dad, and he is also scared. He is scared that he won't be able to help her in the ways she needs help.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKKXWHA4,0.0

We both have a lot of similar interests and she even likes basket weaving. Definitely have to show her my collection of baskets one day. Another person I met was Byron. He was Jewish and recently converted. Apparently he's also a famous DJ and has the same music taste as me. I'm planning on going to one of his shows next week! I'm not really a fan of clubs but hopefully it will be a fun time. Anyways, brunch was pretty good. We went to a Greek restaurant that I've never been to and had the best gyros.

When I was younger, I really didn't understand religion, God, or faith. I would go through the motions of going to church, but I found that I didn't connect to it. I do believe that there is a God, but I never knew how involved He was in my life. As far as I was concerned, He wasn't in my life. One day, I had an epiphany.  I was trapped in the middle of the woods after crashing my ATV. Somehow, someway, a flashlight from my ATV fell out, turned on, and pointed in my direction. It allowed someone to find me, and I was able to make a full recovery from my injuries in a few short months. I cannot imagine an event like that taking place in a world without the existence of God. A few Sundays ago, our RCIA class did an introduction ceremony during Mass. Although there were a few mistakes, all went well. I constantly was reminded of my experience of being lost in the woods left for dead, then found due to a series of blessed events. As a result, I was very moved by this introduction ceremony. When I went home, I fell on my knees and prayed to God. I told him, ""Thank you for all you have done for me."" In reality, without God, I am nothing.",,338JKRMM27LMULZJTN33WPAKJVAHAD,0.0

I was quite miserable, comparable to a sinus infection for years with no real relief. Multiple doctors, many rounds of steroids and antibiotics with no relief. At one point I was offered depression medications.  I was also scared to have someone cutting and cleaning right next to my brain and eyes with only a couple thin bones in between. But at this point I felt desperate. My quality of life was rather low so I was determined to go through with the surgery. And I'm glad I did and I'm grateful I found my ENT doctor when I did. My husband's mother took care of our toddler while my mother and husband accompanied me. I'm grateful for my husband for distracting me with talk of anything other than what was happening that day and rubbing my cold feet before surgery. It really is the little things in life that are most memorable. Breathing through one's nose is definitely something a lot of people take for granted. I remember laying on the freezing cold operating table with nurses, techs, doctor and all the machines as a nurse injected the drug to put me under which felt like cold fire in my veins. I remember waking up in recovery with my nose packed full of gauze and such, wondering where my family was.

I didn't expect to feel anything like this, I never really had an interest in children and getting pregnant was a mistake.

I was out doing my usual grocery shopping at Raley's; picking up some items for a weekend of watching sports. While in the snack aisle I caught a glimpse of a familiar looking woman walk by. We awkwardly looked at each other for a moment trying to figure out if we were correct about each other. It was Jessica, a woman that I had dated years ago until she had to move out of the state for work. We hadn't seen each other since then so it was a shock to find her in my neighborhood. We had a quick conversation in the store and we got caught up on our lives a bit and she said she moved back to help care for her sick father. When I found out she was single I took a chance and invited her out on a date the next night and she agreed. We went to a movie and saw a new romantic comedy that she heard was good and we enjoyed it. Afterwards we stopped at an Italian restaurant and had a great conversation and things felt like she had never left. We went back to my apartment after dinner for a couple of drinks. We got comfortable on the couch and I put on The Boys since she mentioned that she wanted to see it during dinner. We were both asleep before the first episode ended though. She woke me up early and said she had to go but we made plans for another date soon. It was the best evening I have had since the last one I spent with her and I am looking forward to many more like it.",,33F859I567ZRDV4BZ13ZR0UQ2IKBH2,0.0

We use to date when we lived in the same city but now there is a a few hundred miles in between us. I've missed him so I wanted to take a quick weekend trip just to hang out. I ended up staying at his place on the beach which was amazing. Each morning we had breakfast at the local diner and then we would head to the beach to relax a bit. It was so nice just to be in his arms again and smell his cologne. The last night I was there was the best. He surprised me with dinner on the beach and the meal did not disappoint. He made fresh seafood pasta with Alfredo sauce, salad, and homemade rolls. We sipped on our favorite craft beer while we set at the little table he had set up. The most memorable part was the walk we took after supper along the shoreline. The tide was starting to come ashore and he stopped and gave me a gentle kiss. I was stunned when he pulled out a small box with a necklace inside. I was blown away by his kindness. I can't wait until we see each other again but I know it will be a few months.  I just hope we can both wait this distance out and one day be together. If it's meant to be then it will all work out.",,33FBRBDW6PLHUPVOAX5OP779EY28CO,0.0

My friends and I had tickets to ultra music fest and decided that a road trip would be the most fun way to go. The ride should have lasted about 9/10 hours give or take. We left the hotel in Germany at around 6 in the morning, we didnt want to drive to late at night because we would have been tired. We were on the road for about 5 hours when the car we were in experienced a flat tire. Luckily for my friends and I we all know how to change a tire so we got out the car and went to change the tire but there was no extra tire. We were stuck with no service in the middle of no where. We tried calling the rental car company and tried calling for help but there was no connection. My friends and I decided to walk back about 4 miles to where we saw a gas station to call for help. About an hour later we were at the gas station but there was no one there, and we still had no phone service. We decided to stay at the gas station for some time hoping that someone would show up. 4 hours later with no service and still waiting for help we decided to walk back to the car. 30 minutes after walking towards the car we saw a huge van start to head towards us, we jumped up and down for help and the van stopped and a musician who was playing at the same venue we were going to got out the van with his security. My friends and I explained the situation and they gave us a ride to the venue and backstage passes it was amazing. Before we got to the venue we were able to call the rental car company and they tracked the car to pick it up and return it to us. The celebrity and my friends and i ended up hanging out all weekend, and becoming great friends.

I got there early, and found out that Kevin Harvick was going to be at his merchandise hauler signing autographs.  It was very hot that day. After buying a program for Kevin to sign, I got in line. Standing next to me is a man and his son, who appears to be at most 10 years old. They had Harvick shirts on.  The two of them are getting their stuff ready to be signed, as the dad pulls out a die-cast car and hands the kid a picture. As Kevin comes towards us, the kid holds the picture out for Kevin to sign. It is as this point that I see the picture in all of its glory. Kevin takes the picture, sees what’s on it, and starts laughing. He says in between laughs, “I was wondering when I was going to sign this picture.” He signs the picture, then takes off his hat, signs it, and puts on the kid’s head. Kevin tells the kid to “keep being awesome”, gives him a fist bump, and then continues signing autographs. That kid walked away with the biggest smile on his face, and so did his dad.

Having grown up in small city in Texas, the heart of football country, I was familiar with boys like him. It was just my luck to have moved over a thousand miles away and still fall for someone who would have been at ease growing up in my hometown. I enjoy a good football game, but I'm not the type to go out to the stadium every Sunday. And with our home team spending the last several seasons, guarding the bottom of the standings, I made it clear that I would only go to games on a special occasions.  Having lived with my boyfriend for over a year and half, I could feel when something in our routine seemed to shift. I noticed he was on the phone more with his best friend. He normally took his calls in his little office/man cave, rarely closing the door. In fact, I'm more likely to close it when he gets too noisy. Sometimes, you just can't help yourself. So many times I walked by his office and would be completely oblivious to what he was talking about. But this time a few weeks ago, I heard him say, ""That ring is going to be perfect."" And that stopped me right in my tracks. Unfortunately those words were at the end of his conversation.  I back tracked to his office and tried to get some more information from him, but he would only say that he was ""just"" talking to his best friend. Sensing I was going to get anything else out of him with letting on that I may know something, I retreated from his office. I really didn't know how to feel at that moment. We both love each other and there were no real issues between the two us. It was just marriage was not something we'd spoke about yet. A little while later, I was in the kitchen making a smoothie for lunch, when he came strolling in. He seemed a bit nervous (or excited, still really can't figure which it was). He asked me if we had any plans the following Sunday. After confirming on our day-planner that we were free, he said to block the day for a football game. I readily agreed. Fast forward to the game and me watching his best friend propose to his girlfriend of 3 months at half-time.",,33IZTU6J82NNG7LSFR7GKBSKS6UXS5,0.0

I've had this session for a while (it was a gift) but it took me almost 3 years post-death to scrape up the courage to actually do it. I was skeptical, absolutely—I do believe in spirits and that our energy has to go somewhere after death, but that's a far leap to actually communicating with a dead person. So, going into it, I was honestly more scared that it was going to work than that it wouldn't. The first few questions he asked me were basic—said that he was seeing a father figure and asked me if a grandfather of mine had died. Being my age, it's fairly reasonable to assume that at least one of my grandfathers are dead (both are) and as I wasn't particularly close to mine, as he was talking about him, I was starting to write the psychic off as a phony. However, then he asked me if there was someone specific I wanted to contact, and of course, there was; I asked him to bring my friend forward by repeating her name multiple times. Immediately, things felt different. He started pulling out details about her death that were 100% accurate, and while I was definitely getting closer to believing him, I still wondered if he had researched my social media in depth or taken the time to do a deep search on people in my life. But as we went on, he started recalling things that there were absolutely no way he could have known. He pulled memories out, he described the streets I walk on on my way to work (where apparently, my friend walks alongside me sometimes). He talked about her parents, about how she feels now that she's in a different place, and asked about our other mutual friends. At this point, I was pretty convinced (and emotional, of course). It wasn't until he pulled out a very specific detail—something that had only taken place in a private setting after my friend had already died—that I absolutely lost it and started sobbing; I knew it was real. I was somewhat in shock; I was essentially communicating with someone that I was sure I would never have the chance to again. The session was only 45 minutes long, and I wish I could have had longer, but it provided me with a sense of closure that I hadn't felt in years. It made me sad, for sure, but it also made me happier, and it felt like I was relieving a burden. It was one of the things that have affected me most in my recent life.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QMMNU,33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0QMMNU,0.0

I usually wake up for work around 7 AM but today I was awoken by the sound of someone sobbing hysterically. It was my brother. My  brother suffers from chronic depression and is believed to  be bipolar. I could already tell  my brother was going  to have a  manic episode that day. So i thought i would take a shower early before he was able to lock me  into  a conversation and i  would have to speak to my  brother and look into the eyes of a brother i had lost years ago. In order to understand my situation, as the reader you have to understand that his manic episodes come in packages; Anger, Sadness and euphoria. I wasnt sure what emotion was  going to come out tooday so i decided to get in the  shower. As im getting  in the shower the dooor knob starts to rattle. I immediately know its my  brother but i act like i dont know who  it is. ""hello!?"" i call out. The doorknob begins to rattle even more viciously than before. i call out once more and bang the door ""HELLO!?"". As i open the door because the rattling wont stop its my brother, or is a shell of what he once was. He is unshaven, 100 lbs overweight and smells and looks like he hasnt showered in a week. I tell him  ""dude what the fuck?"" but he just stares at me and doesnt say a word. after about 10 seconds of awkward silence he says  ""im going to work today fucker"" and leaves me with an manical smille. My parents left that day for vegas for vacation. The next couple of days are some of the most horrifying days of my life.",33JKGHPFYDGF6IUJTOOLA02G0RENMP,,0.0

Least i expected was that the movie turned out to be a murder thriller where some guy is killed and the search for the murderer seemed to be the plot.  When the movie was over & we got up to go to bed, my dad looked at us, especially towards me. He then said that he too had faced a similar situation before. I couldn't get what that was about. That's when he told us the story which left us completely shocked. My dad started to tell a story about how he murdered a guy. I was completely horrified. A lot was running through my mind like - who when how and why, what must have happened and who the guy was. And then suddenly my dad looking at my face, started laughing hysterically and kept saying that he couldn't believe i fell for his lie & that how could i even think that he killed someone. Obviously he was right, but i must say he's a pro and was completely convincing with his lie. What finally punched me was when he called me - April Fool.",,33L7PJKHCHKYG6XZWJ0EEH7DEYJ8TS,0.0

We had never been very close to begin with.  We also hadn't talked since mid-2011, either.  My mother had always told me that my father was from Ireland, but he had died by suicide when I was very young, and I never knew him. As a response to the grief I felt over my mom, I did a DNA test, and started to discover my Irish heritage and making contact with 400+ relatives in and around Ireland and the EU. Due to the fact that he was from there, I had automatic citizenship, but needed an Irish passport to ""prove"" it and obtain full dual citizenship. I spent a few months gathering all of my documentation. This included my dad's birth records from 1933 in Ireland, his military records from his service in the Korean war after moving to America years later.  I have never felt more connected to someone I never knew. I have never felt more complete and confident of who I am and where I am going.  Planning to visit and ideally move to Ireland has been the greatest gift, and one that I never expected as a result of such a massive loss of my mother to suicide. I literally cried for a week after I found out, and was convinced that I would never feel happy or whole again. Luckily, the universe had different plans for me than I had for myself.  The universe understands we are placed here to be happy and healthy and to thrive.  And I am finally catching up with the Universe, and boy, does it feel good.",,33LKR6A5KF6G56DEXYRZZ7K50WG1TC,0.0

It was a big get together with a bunch of friends. We met at one of their houses and had the party in their backyard. It was a standard barbecue in the afternoon next to their pool. One person cooked on the grill, cooking hamburgers, sausage and hot dogs. Then the rest of us brought something, macaroni salad potato salad. Some people brought chips and others brought soda, water, beer and wine coolers. There were a few bottles of vodka and rum as well. One friend wanted to experiment and brought a lot of different things so that they could make mix drinks. They mainly made mojitos since that is what they like the most.  I made a few desserts a cheesecake and a strawberry short cake. We mainly spent most of the time talking and catching up and playing card games or a board game. A few people went swimming. It was most memorable because it was the first time in a while that we were all together. All of our schedules are a bit all over so it is very rare that everyone can be together at the same time.",33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NOZS9RXE,33M4IA01QHNBFSLF027BU1NOZS9RXE,0.0

This has been one of the hardest days of my life.   I lost my little friend, Prance.   I should start by saying that Prance was a rescue dog.  Prance came from a local shelter.  Prance was 3 years old when I got him.   The day, April 17,  that I got Prance was exactly a year to the day that I had lost another dog, Butch.   Like Butch, Prance was a Schnauzer.   I woke up that morning and just had a strong desire to go to the animal shelter. And there was Prance.     From the first moment, we bonded, and he was like my little grey shadow. April 17th 2019, I treated  the day like it was Prance's birthday, since he actual birth date was unknown.    He had turned 12.   Prance had always been a very picky eater and he had started refusing his food.   On the 4th day of not eating, I took Prance to the vet.   Prance had pancreatitis and had to be hospitalized.   When Prance came home, he was refusing to eat again.    Prance began to get very weak and had difficulty standing up.     He was now at a point where he could not walk at all.   Prance was laying next to me, as he always was, while I watched TV.    Prance suddenly reached out his paw to me 3 times, like he would do when he wanted to get some attention.   I picked Prance up and held him.   Prance began to tremble and shake.   He took a couple of deep breathes and went limp in my arms.      I  feel like Prance reached out to me to say goodbye, and e I am happy that I was there  for him in his last moment of life.",,33PPO7FECW1KONDFJFCQM2J54BVIDI,0.0

I was going through many things such as my mother being in a comatose state, me losing my job, and falling in love with someone who didn't deserve me.  During this time I fell back deeply in love with something other than myself or another person. I felt back on something that was dependable and reliant. I fell back on drugs. I knew that it would happen to someone, but never that it would happen to me. I couldn't bring my self to believe that I would someday need Naloxone to be revived from the point of death twice. The effects of the drugs started to happen around 7:00 pm est when I started to go into a heavy sleep. My friend pulled the car over to assist me in waking up  and start CPR on myself until the ambulance arrived. I took the ambulance about 15 minutes to get there, and to administer the Naloxone. At this point I was unconscious with no pulse until the Naloxone was administered. Once inside of the ambulance I died once more with no pulse until the EMT attendants started CPR and resuscitated me. I ended up going to the nearest hospital which was about 25 minutes away. I was kept in isolation for about six hours while the nurses and doctors ran test on me. I ended up having side effects from the situation. I was diagnosed with pneumonia, collapsed lungs, and bruised lungs. I was released from the hospital that night, but had to return for a two day stay at the commonwealth hospital. I had never felt so drained in my life before until this moment were i felt like i could just rest, and finally be safe.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZGRXRZ8,0.0

It started with us starting to say hateful stuff towards each other. I would tell her that i hated i never got too see her, and that I it felt like i was not even in a relationship. She told me that she's sorry i felt that way, but I needed to get over myself. This of course, hurt me very much. We had been friends for years before we even considered dating, and the relationship was starting to fade. I could not bring myself to end it at the time, so we continued. The situation worsened as time went on. We went from remarks, to full on hating each other. She would come over and i would tell her that i did not want to see her. I started having anxiety attacks thinking about what the relationship was coming too. When my birthday came around, I sat her down and told her that I was seriously not happy with the relationship, and it needed to end. She agreed and i have not talked to her since.

One of the drivers came to the last car, the bar car, where we were. He said, ""we missed a flag stop, there is a trapper and his dog out there. We cannot leave him in this cold (-33 C)."" If you want to know about cold read Jack London, ""To build a fire"" book. We could see a very faint light about 2km behind the train. Then  we backed up until we came to where we saw the trapper, his baggage and his dog. A couple of attendants jumped off the train tended to his baggage. The train, 13 cars and about 500m long, continued to back up. The trapper's big black dog was taken into the heated luggage car, the first car after two locomotives, wrapped in blankets and placed near and electric heater. Our resident chef was arousen and went to the kitchen at a very late hour to prepare a warming meal for the cold man. A bit of ""Canada"" for you, He had been there, outside by the track, for over five hours. No Cellphone service and he had no idea when the train  would arrive. When it came, it drove by him at 120km/h. Imagine his horror.",,33PPUNGG39R0KNLU1KVWRM3ZPSSRZE,0.0

The health condition became a major concern in her day to day life. She had to adjust her lifestyle in order to manage her condition. Each day was a challenge to keep her blood sugar level under control and at the correct level. Previous to the diagnosis, my sister-in-law was a chef and thoroughly enjoyed preparing food for others and entertaining. As time went on her condition became worse as she was unable to make the appropriate changes for controlling her diabetes. She began to suffer consequences from the condition including having body parts amputated. She became more depressed as the condition became more and more debilitating. One day she was having dinner in a restaurant and began to have stroke like symptoms. She was rushed to the hospital and was diagnosed with two brain tumors. This news was devastating to me and to all of her family members. She only lived a short time after the diagnosis of the tumors. She died within six months of the diagnosis. This was a very emotional event for her two daughters, her husband and her extended family. We all continue to struggle with the fact that she is no longer with us and that she died at such a young age.",33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYJZKWEO,33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYJZKWEO,0.0

I woke up on a bright sunny day feeling like the world was mine for the taking. I had an important meeting for work later on that afternoon, but did not have any other obligations until then. My parents had recently just divorced and my father had moved into his own little apartment in town. He was never the best at making meals for himself so I had started the habit of dropping him off some casseroles that I had prepared for him. I feared that he was lonely and heartbroken after my mother's infidelity. So, on that beautiful summer morning I decided that I would use my extra spare time to lend him a visit, and bring him some delicious lasagna that I had baked the night before. I drove there with the roof of my convertible down and the wind in my hair blasting some old favorite rock songs from days past. When I arrived to his residence, I saw that the cat was out on the porch. This struck me as unusual as my father had always been adamant that we watch the doors and not let our feline friends risk being run over by traffic. I picked fluffy up in my my arms and proceeded through the half opened door. I called out for my father with no response. I noticed a note on the counter that was addressed to me, it read: ""Honey, I love you, please do not go in the bedroom"". My heart started pounding out of my chest as I ran over to the bedroom. To my horror, I found my father laying on the floor, his head covered in blood with a revolver by his side. He had taken his own life and left me to find him. He had left me behind to face his horrific death. He felt as though life was no loner worth is for him, that I was no longer worth living for. I wish I could have known, I wish I could have saved him.",,33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,0.0

My life will be forever changed. My dad had been sick with what everyone thought was the flu. He was throwing up and complaining of being very tired and hot. He didn't even have a fever. He had been sick for a few days, but on a Tuesday in the early evening everything quickly spiraled out of control. My mom called my husband and asked him to hurry over to the house because she thought something was wrong with my dad. He went over there and my dad was not doing well at all. He didn't know his name, where he was at and who my mom or my husband were. My mom immediately called 9-1-1. When the ambulance got there they immediately checked my dads vitals and got him loaded to rush to the hospital. They took him to the intensive care unit and got him hooked up to a million different machines to see if they could figure out what was going on with him. By this time it was late into the night on Tuesday. We were all sitting in the waiting room until more information was known. It was a very long night of millions of tests and no answers. Finally early in the morning on Wednesday a doctor came out and told my mom that my dad was suffering of kidney failure. We were all in shock because he hadn't been sick long at all. We asked what we could do and the doctor said it was too late too do anything and that if they even tried to operate he would die. The doctor could not give us a timeline of how long he would live, but that it wouldn't be more than six weeks. Well, it turns out it would be even sooner than that. By early the next morning my dad had passed away. We were all in shock because there hadn't been any warning signs and just a week ago he had been happy and hanging out with us. We were devastated and from that moment on our lives had changed forever.",33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,33SA9F9TRYG7HOBK4RRPTBAYK21WEC,0.0

I was thinking about a MBA for years but never went through with the application process. I took many classes and received many certifications in fields such as project management, leadership, etc. I had no other choice. So, I applied and was accepted. I was very happy. I told my manager and he agreed that other people on my team need to step up and share my workload and I cannot be the only spokesperson for the company when regulatory bodies audit.

First, I was named to be among the most successful students in my class!  I ran into and old friend from childhood that I haven't seen in 2 years and my brother who has been missing for 6 months finally came home and was knocking at the door!   This of course was the most shocking event of the past 2 weeks.  When I heard a knock at the door one afternoon after school I pretty much opened the door without even so much as looking to see who it was, which was my habit.  You can imagine my shock and surprise to see my brother that no one has seen in 6 months, and thought the worst, standing there before me!  It took a few seconds before I was able to scream out, you're back!  Thinking back now, my brother wasn't even the least bit excited to see me or to be home for that matter. It was almost as if he just went out for a few minutes and was back being greeted by a hysterical brother. He finally walks inside and I am still at the door holding it open when I hear another excited scream come from a distant part of the house.  It was my poor mother  who has been besides herself with worry these past couple of months. I slowly close the door and walk back inside to find my mother and brother.   My mother is asking rapid fire questions to my mostly emotionless brother who seemed to look like maybe this was a bad idea.  Where had he been, what was he doing and why had he not contacted any of us in all that time? The more I thought about this, the more agitated I started to become.

I had no choice but to live out of my car with my family for about two months.  Being homeless and living out of a car is not something I would want anybody to go through. It hard and embarassing and crushing to your self-esteem. I felt like I had no control over my life and that I did not do enough to keep a roof over my head. And the cats hated being stuck in a car, can you imagine that added stress. Finally my fiancee's parents said we could stay with them until we got back on our feet again. Although I was grateful for this it was uncomfortable living with people who have such hateful opinions of gays/lesbians. I dont have these feelings so I did my best to ignore that because like I said I was grateful for a place to stay. We are slowly getting back on our feet and I hope that it continues. Its not fun being homeless. I only faced this issue for a small amount of time compared to others. I am hopeful for the future.",,34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,0.0

My fiancee and I have been living together for three years roughly. We were never well off, but our bills always got paid and we usually had plenty of groceries. Our two cats never had to go without and some might say they were spoiled. It knocked my self confidence and my belief in myself down to nothing. I second guessed every decision we made that could have possibly prevented us getting evicted. I think about it constantly because I'm still recovering and dealing with the aftermath. I often get depressed that I don't feel self sufficient and I have constant flashbacks to living in my PT Cruiser with my fiancee and my two cats over the summer. I felt like such a failure and hated seeing the woman I love be so hopeless and sad. I still have days where the feeling of failure overwhelms me. I've basically had to go back to square one. All the progress I made and was making in my adult life got set back to zero. All of the plans and goals we had set had to be pushed into the back of my mind. I couldn't focus on saving up money for my wedding, my health, a second car, etc. Those goals are now wishful thinking. I have to muster up the energy to just get out of bed and will myself to accomplish anything. I have to get a new job again, look for a smaller cheaper apartment again, struggle, and worry that I may not be able to afford the necessities. I might not be able to pay for any medical emergencies, or taking one of my cats to the vet, or a surprise car repair. It's humbling on the bright side, but wears you down as a person on the realistic side. That's how I'm dealing with the aftermath of my eviction currently.",34BBWHLWHBXJXTD60AHGEQ8QCT0WI9,,0.0

My doctor initially told me it would be a good idea to help ease my symptoms, but I'm starting to really enjoy being out and about. About three months ago I was especially restless one morning and opted to take myself out for a day of fun. I hit the local mall and walked all through my favorite stores. I probably spent a full hour in Macy's alone. I bought a pair of new sandals and a really cute beach hat too, which are things that coincidentally help reinforce this new lifestyle I'm trying out. After shopping I stopped into a new restaurant that opened near the mall. It felt odd to eat by myself, but after a few minutes I really started to enjoy it. I almost felt like some important business person. My steak was perfectly cooked and I even had a margarita to drink. By this point I really started to feel my legs getting achy, and the 100 degree temperatures outside didn't exactly help things too much. Against my better judgement I ended up deciding to see a movie to cool down, but found myself frustrated when I realized the theater's air conditioning was turned off. Who turns off AC in 100 degree heat?!? I ended up finishing the movie, but my legs were not in great shape and I was feeling quite dehydrated. After sitting on a bench for a bit to gather my thoughts, I determined that I should not try to get home in this shape. Thankfully my good friend Judith answered her phone and was willing to come get me and take me home.

However, more recently, I was published in a more established magazine. My friends threw me a congratulatory party, and it blew me away. My party was hosted at a beach house. They had decorated it all pink, and with my initials everywhere. They even cut out and framed my poem and pasted it everywhere. Bits of my writing were adorned throughout the house and the yard. It was also themed! They had it themed around tea parties, which I love. They purchased all sorts of unique teas, including blooming tea. I had never seen blooming tea before, and was amazed, as I love flowers as well. Overall, I had a blast at this party where we all celebrated something very meaningful to me. I am so proud of myself, and I just have the best friends ever.

We had practiced a lot online and in lan tournaments to prepare for the finale. Sometimes we would have time out members when some of us get tired and unfocused.

We all were looking forward to this moment and what way to make it even better than to figure out it was for real money! Someone had hosted our match and put up $500 for the winners, split evenly of course. You can say there was more pressure but for sure it was nice to see our video game endeavors were finally paying off! My pro buddy didn't like how my other friend was brand new. He barely had any experience and he said he was going to cost us the match. I asked my pro buddy to give him a chance and to represent us! He said it was all up to me because I was the one who created the hosting. Fast forward game day, we had practiced for a while and were ready to play. Game starts and we are up a heavy lead (3 vs 6). We start choking and we lose the lead big time (6 vs 12). We start grinding and it of course becomes overtime for both the teams (15 vs 15). It ultimately goes to 1 vs 1 with my new friend being the last alive. He magically clutches it and we win the round and the prizepool of $500!",,34PGFRQONPXFS4XCIS2GQRNQFVFWJB,0.0

Many types of people who in some ways affect both our lives positively and negatively, as long as we decide that it affects us. In my short life of 28 years I have become a rampant traveler because of the search for wealth that is not exactly monetary but rather the wealth that provides a good memory of someone or somewhere. I have known many parts of the world, many people, cultures and have heard their stories, legends and the wisdom they have. But two years ago I decided to take a trip but not one to another place but I gave myself the task of knowing the people around me thoroughly, to give them my confidence, to know that world they have inside their mind. Because as I say each person is a world, some are full of goodness, wisdom and much love but others are rotten by deception and evil. A few weeks ago on my trip to meet people I came across an old woman who gave me the first impression of being a kind, honest and honest person. I managed to talk to her, meet her and it was so good that I had fallen that I started a few days to give her an extremely good confidence. I could tell her everything and she, until one day I made a request, and this was to lend him $ 2,500 to pay his mortgage, when he told me this I was a little surprised by his request and after thinking a little I decided to give him the money. After a few days of lending him the money, that nice old lady who had met and liked me so much, began to change his way of being with me. It became more closed, when I visited her home she didn't attend me or sometimes she didn't even open the door to greet me, at that moment I started to see that something was very wrong. Although as a kind old lady I thought, ""Surely she must be busy or sick and doesn't want to help me.""But one day I met her at the walmart and she saw me when she was surprised and greeted me with a lot of hypocrisy and left, it was no place to talk about the loan. So days and days went by until I took on the task of inquiring if she really had used that for her mortgage, the truth was that no, I spend it on something I still don't know. Seeing this, I went to her house and argued with her I was so upset that I could not even think, I felt so deceived, and I told her that I was going to report her to pay me the money. It was a very tense moment. Until she confezo me it was my grandmother, that grandmother who had believed missing since long ago, that grandmother since childhood so much wanted to have and now hate her for having deceived, that grandmother tricky and very unethical. In the end, I decided to forgive her, she wanted to maintain the relationship after the lack of respect she made, I just decided to get away from her and continue with my life.",,34Q075JO1YZFPXGNZW3PFWI03G2018,0.0

I greet him with all the affection in the world as he had been gone for three months already. The man who owns the house hears the fuss and comes outside. I thank him for finding my dog and taking good care of him but he insists that he had the dog for years and that I can't have him. I tell him that this is none other than my dog and all we have to do is check the chip to verify. He is having none of it and calls the police. I tell him that he is more than welcome and that will help solve the situation sooner. The police arrive and hear the story for themselves.

It all started about 3 months ago when I took my doggo Pips to the local dog park. After running around with her for about 15  minutes, I noticed that Pips slowing down. She took a couple of breaks before quitting and sat down for a rest. Now this was a little odd because Pips has been an active dog since a pup. I call Pips up and tell her to fetch me her favorite toy bunny. After looking at me and the her toy she gets up slowly, I notice that she's arching her back in a weird way and limps to the toy. At that moment, I could have kicked myself because that wasn't my dog. Pips was hurting and my guilt rose quickly because being her momma, I should have noticed it as soon as she sat down the first time. But Pips being the people pleaser she was, obeyed my command. It was that moment when I made a call to our Vet where I was told to bring Pips first thing in the morning. When we arrived at the vet, the Doctor did the usual checks and vitals. The doctor claimed it was some kind of back injury and prescribed Pips some pain meds and suggested some weird exercises and stretches to do with her. I was told that the I would be called for a follow up soon.  It's been 4 weeks and no calls or answers from the doctor. Pips has lost weight and the pain meds have ran out. I tried the exercises and Pips howls out in pain! We can't sleep and I cannot bare to see Pips in pain anymore! I have to carry her everywhere and I have already missed too many days at work! I am currently looking for another vet I can trust. If I don't, I have no clue what will happen to Pips. I just want her to be okay so I can have my silly, hyper puppy back.",,34S6N1K2ZW53Q4QNQEST53QVEBLHLG,0.0

All of our neighbors also take part in this as there really is a fireworks show right above our house.  We took her outside and at first she acted a bit scared because of all the noise. After a little bit though she relaxed and began to enjoy seeing all of the lights in the sky and hearing the noise. She was really having a great time seeing all of these things for the very first time and it reminded me how much something like this can mean. It took me back and made me enjoy the 4th more than I have in a long time. I really enjoyed watching how she reacted to each huge firework that exploded in the sky above her head. She was throwing her hands in the air and screaming in joy about how much fun she was having with all of this. We really had a great time on this 4th showing this little girl what this holiday was all about. She had a great experience with the entire thing and really enjoyed her first one. She couldn't stop smiling as she was having the time of her life during this event.,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YLNY1,,0.0

She comes over and spends each weekend with me and my family here. My daughter that had her is only 19 and I had her young as well so I am a young grand mother. I really enjoy bonding with this little girl as it lets me almost in a way relive being a mom because I'm not even 40 yet and I have a grandchild. Well this summer I decided that she should come over to our house to have some fun on the 4th of July. My daughter agreed so we had a nice family get together at my house for the holiday. During this day we spent some time feeding her some grilled food and just playing with her having a really great time on her first 4th of July. Then the night started to roll in upon us and where I love we can still shoot fireworks. We had bought a lot of ones to be done at night because I'm a big fan of the pretty shiny style of fireworks. So we took this little girl outside so she could get a good look at all of the fireworks. We slowly began to shoot them off one after another. I watched the look on this child's face as she just got so excited, hearing the noises and watching all of the pretty colors. It really touched me to remember what it could have been like for me or even my children when they got that excited for something like this. It really made me feel good that we could make this child so happy by doing something so simple for her. We continued shooting off all of these awesome fireworks we had bought including some really huge ones that lit up the entire sky. We did this until we were done and the baby never lost her excitement and continued to smile and scream out during the entire process. It really was a great night and time for the baby's first 4th of July Party.",34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YLNY1,34S9DKFK74BF0ZJXCRCW4VPN8YLNY1,0.0

I was inspired by the new coach at our gym to compete much more frequently. I had also lost fairly decisively at a tournament in February - I needed redemption. I prepared in several different ways. First, I needed to lose about 5 pounds. This takes a good amount of self-discipline, as your body has a hard time readjusting to a caloric deficit. I removed carbs and also just ate less in general, eating a minimum of protein and veggies necessary. I lost about 7 pounds total and was in great shape. My cardio was another issue. I needed to boost my stamina, as in my previous competition I had biked vigorously but still fatigued. My new strategy was to spar at other gyms as often as I could. Fighting someone unfamiliar to you will make you more competitive and more uneasy, which is exactly what a tournament is. The tournament itself was almost disappointing, as it seemed my opponents did not provide enough of a challenge. Who you fight on the day of will always be random. But the lessons I learned in preparation were eye-opening. I came out of this experience a stronger person.",34X6J5FLPUKA871Q6J3AY254ZIGJQW,,0.0

We agreed to let him stay. Things started out ok, but went downhill quickly. He began to withdraw from the drugs. He felt ill, was irritable and cranky. He wanted my husband to help him get drugs, just enough to ease him through the worst of it, but I didn't want him to.

It was the day before my birthday and I was eagerly in anticipation of the fun party that I would have with my friends, and all the gifts that I would receive. Unfortunately, along with the excitement I started feeling sick and had a massive pain in my stomach. The pain was unbearable and I was taken to hospital. After days of having tests conducted on me, the doctor concluded that I was suffering from Crones Disease. The doctor told me that this was a severe disease that would impact my life in many ways. The doctor also told me that I had to change many of established lifestyle choices in order to combat this new ordeal. I was shocked, I had never gotten such bad news before. I had always felt that I was strong and that nothing could affect me. I was wrong, I was now in pain and if I did not change my life my future would be in doubt. Instead of being happy and getting a chance to celebrate my birthday, I had to change my diet, my weight management, and my eating habit because of this disease. I had always struggled to eat healthy, but now I had no choice, eating healthy was essential. The whole change process was difficult and mentally challenging for me, but I preserved and continued because I was determined to get better. A couple of months later, the changes started to feel easier and I was starting to feel less pain. I was glad everything was working and this motivated me to work harder. Now a days, I eat much cleaner and the whole process is way easier. To be totally honest with myself, I'm glad something like this happened to me. I'm now living a better life, have a healthier life, and a better value and outlook on life. This disease really enabled and pushed me to change my life for the better, I'm happy with the way things have turned out.",,351SEKWQS136K6364UAIEVQMKXMMDY,0.0

But now I'm convinced that it wasn't quite like that. They told me that they had been avoiding people and trying to just live, that they had been tired and busy all of the time. This makes sense, but I don't know when you stop being busy, or when you're too busy for someone you care about. I always figure it takes just a minute, even less, to answer someone's texts or to say, ""Hey, I'm sorry, I'm a little busy, I'll let you know what's going on later."" It's bothering me so much.

I was surprised at the end of the ceremony that I was given an award for my leadership study I had done while attending the school. I did not know I was even in the running for this award. I got a medal as well as a nice certificate. I have the medal in my office to remind me of my hard work.

We threw our luggage and bikes into the bed of the truck, and hit the road. The trip was long, but fairly uneventful. About 12 hours later, we arrived at the lake house. Although the weather wasn't the best the whole time, we had a ton of fun. The rainy or cold days, we sat around the cabin and read books and put together puzzles. On the sunny and warm days, the kids spend the whole day in the lake. We particularly enjoyed riding the jet-ski, and the younger children had a blast getting to drive it for the first time. We took them out on trails on 4-wheelers, and as always, they loved it. We also took the truck to gather firewood, but damaged the tailgate in the process! It was pretty entertaining when our youngest got stuck on the wrong side of the fence at the border crossing, but that was quickly resolved. After a week, we packed everything back up, and began the long trek back home. We chose to make the return trip at night, in order to minimize stops. After driving all night, I was EXHAUSTED when we arrived home at 4am! We're all counting down the weeks until we go again!",354GIDR5ZCSFI8V53DZP1RZQPUA00M,,0.0

It's made me question my perspective on everything from my self concept to my understanding of love and the impermanence of life. Mom had a rare form of cancer that was hard to diagnose and radically aggressive. We only found out about it when she had a body MRI and the tumor was discovered in her kidney. She was given three months to live and a very high certainty of mortality in that time frame, no matter the treatment. Mom's a fighter, so she decided to live those three months as honestly and fully as possible. She moved in with us so she could spend more time with my wife, my daughter and I. It was controversial but she decided against chemo or other treatment so she could enjoy her time. In the first month we traveled to Kauai and Peru, two places she had always wanted to go, but most importantly we walked to daycare to drop off my daughter after laughing through breakfast, watched crappy gameshows and silly movies, and played games. By month two she had lost her ability to really move around, and 60 days later, she passed in her sleep. The honest and tender moments we spent together in her last days have shown me the most important words in life are, ""I love you."" I will never forget the time we spent together. My daughter will always have cherished memories of grandma, her last picture taken was at Pfeiffer park in Big Sur, snuggling with her. Sometimes life puts crises in your path to learn a hard lesson. This lesson for me is about grief. Grief is a hard emotion, but a necessary one. Without grief you cannot know love.",,354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFW1XCS7H,0.0

He had a hard time walking, he didn't have much energy, and overall he just wasn't doing good. Some days were better than others, but for the most part he was having more good days (at the time). He was 16 at the start of 2019, he would have been 17 in July 2019. I noticed around February 2019 that he wasn't eating his normal dog food, so I began looking for alternatives so he would be able to eat. I purchased various dog foods, from wet and dry and anything else I could find. Tried different meats like fish, chicken, beef and lamb. He would eat the new dog food that I purchased him for a few days and then all of a sudden stop eating it. It got to the point where I started making his own dog food in a desperate attempt to maintain his weight. But, as much as I tried, he just wouldn't eat as much as he needed to, or wouldn't eat at all. His eyesight was getting worse, to the point where he was almost completely blind. He went deaf when he was 14 years old, so it was breaking my heart watching him lose all of his senses. It was to the point where I was considering putting him down because his quality of life just wasn't there, but then he would have a good day and it would make me question myself. Not only that, I didn't want to put down my baby. He had been my best friend for 16 years and I wasn't ready to let him go. Just writing this now is making me cry. Anyway, he wasn't doing very well but he was still having a few good days here and there, but I noticed around March he was having more bad days at this point. Then, something worse happened. I don't remember if I went into detail my last diary entry, but it was bad. Blood was coming out places it shouldn't, and I knew it was time. My husband and I made an appointment and we put him down together, we stayed in the room the entire time. And yeah, I don't really have anything else to say. This was difficult to write, I'm sorry if this was all over the place.",354P56DE9LPT1SF1XE3IQCFWPHI7SU,,0.0

I have been in front of a group of people and I have acted as the resident expert on the subject of writing.  Even though they were seventh graders and willing to accept my authority without question, I know what it has cost me to put myself before them.  It cost me the protection that I have always had from ever letting anyone know how much I knew, or what I was capable of.  I have been insulated by Amy's perceptions of my ability from confronting my actual ability.  At every recurrence of the event in my memory my stomach drops and I choke back the urge to tell someone what an impostor I am.  Amy's words of affirmation soothe this urge but even then I question her sincerity and her likely desire to protect my ego.  Whether Amy is a liar or not, it happened and I think that the main victory lies there.  I have claimed victory over my pride enough to allow myself to stand and be judged.  The fact that I am being praised instead of rejected is a delightful surprise but one that also comes with the responsibility of repetition.  My failure would have at least meant the end of this foray into teaching.  Instead, my success means that I will have to continue to work in humility to teach others what I know and be willing to accept a position of authority.  Nothing is more contrary to my inclinations than to be in charge, to be responsible.  This is a charge I have to accept with humility and possibly even gratitude.

I've lived here 16 years, not the longest by far in this little area, but established. I own my home. I have planted many flowers, repainted it myself and reroofed a formerly run-down rental. The new neighbors put up a religious sign, from the local hate church. You know, the kind of church that goes to gay pride with signs that say, 'god hates fags,' or picket planned parenthood with fetus photos and angry shouting. The new neighbors' son also practice with weapons on the lawn with his buddies, some kind of asian battle sticks, numchucks, that kind of thing. It's a bunch of white men in their early 20's dressed in black almost every evening, using weapons. I am lesbian and not the only gay on the street. I felt more than a little threatened. Some neighbors stopped by to check in with me and let me know I could come by if I felt unsafe.  Two houses left phone numbers. After the new folks put up their sign from the hate church, new signs started popping up all over the neighborhood. It is a sign based on a US flag with lines of colored print. One line says, 'all are welcome here.' Another line says, ""diversity makes us strong. ' Another says, 'black lives matter.' Basically liberal, loving and inclusive statements and rally cries as befits most residents in this liberal university town. I felt very supported,  as an individual,  as a member of the neighborhood and as a member of a group often targeted for the way we were born.  When the church sign went up, I wasn't sure my neighbors would know the type of church it is- a divisive church, a judgemental church. But they did know, and responded. Now the new neighbors have taken down their sign. But the diversity signs have remained and multiplied. It reminds me of why I have felt so comfortable and welcome here.",358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8BVXR,358010RM5FF38Z2W9MCLVYCRR8BVXR,0.0

I am having a difficult time writing this because I felt as if Dad and I were starting to get close again after such a long time apart.  Until Dad's cancer, I hadn't seen or talked to him in over 10 years.  The bitterness that I held inside was very taxing on me and I'm sure on him as well.  When he left Mom for another woman, he destroyed our lives.  As a little girl, I always looked to Dad as my hero.  I truly looked up to him and thought of him as the greatest man on earth.  I always felt that if I ever got married, I wanted my husband to have the same characteristics as Dad.  After Dad left, I began a downward spiral and didn't want anything to do with any man.  Through prayer and guidance, I have been able to get past these feelings and realize that I can't put every man in the same category.  After Dad was diagnosed with Cancer, he asked to see me and we talked many times and began to heal our relationship.  Dad regretted the horrible mistakes he made and asked forgiveness from God, Mom and me.    Just saying ""I forgive you"" began the healing process for both of us.  Sadly, it wasn't long after that the Lord decided to take Dad.  I believe that knowing he was forgiven allowed him to die peacefully and with the love of God and family.",,35BLDD71I7JSDU2BA406SJS2AVNZVR,0.0

Then a day after, I and my boyfriend went out to see our friend to catch up on old time. We all had fun and they also show us around. Denver is one of the most beautiful place have ever been to. It has the most beautiful stores, mall, eateries one can visit. Denver also have different varieties of food one will want to taste. I and my boyfriend also tasted all the delicacy there. We and our friends also went for shopping, we had a small get together party, where we talked about our Jobs, families and some places we would all love to visit. Later that day we had to say our goodbye because that was the last day of our stay at Denver. It's a trip I and my boyfriend will always remember. This is one kind of trip that I will never forget.

I did that, and was cycling home, when suddenly I heard a weird noise, and noticed some pain in my back. I didn't realize what was going on, and just then I saw a car driving next to me, and some ugly dark-skinned subhuman face looking at me. It was then that I realized that I had been shot, with something, and saw that this hideous mongrel chick was trying to shoot me again. I yelled at her, and reached for my own gun, and the cowardly spawn of liberals drove off because they don't fight with people who are able to defend themselves. They got away before I could defend myself. I then went to the liquor store for beer, and was able to verify that it was a paintball gun I'd been shot with. My backpack and clothes were covered with the junk. My back hurt pretty good, and when I left the liquor store I cycled around for a bit to see if I might run into those beautiful brown skinned children of Obama again, but there was no such luck. I went back to my place, and looked in the mirror, and there was a nice golf-ball sized dent in my back where I'd been hit, surrounded by a big red welt. Liberal social justice had been served tonight. Cheered up by this realization, I had my beers and iced up my back, and tried to get over the whole thing, realizing it was inevitable as part of the progress that modern society needs to march forward bravely into the beautiful new era of liberalism.  Despite this, I resolved to be more ready to get my gun out in the future. I also decided to save up money for a longer range firearm in case preventive measures become necessary at some later date. Then I went to bed.",35DR22AR5E6JWQ0DPC6FC3K8ZUY3XT,,0.0

I was midway through my pregnancy, which is a difficult time as the visits to the doctor are still spaced four weeks apart. This means that for four agonizing weeks, we do not know for sure how the baby is doing. Once we visit the doctor, we can get confirmation that her heart is beating and that she is growing on track, but until then, we do not know for sure. Once the baby starting kicking, however, it was almost a lifeline back to sanity and away from anxiety, as I at least knew that she was alive and moving. That said, it was easy to start wondering if it was really her I felt kicking, as she was still so small and the kicks were fairly light. At times of worry, I would start to wonder if I was imagining it, or if it was digestion, or something akin. One night, though, the kicks felt quite strong, and I asked my husband to touch my belly and see if he could feel them. His eyes lit up, and he said he felt them. He lifted his finger each time he felt a kick, to see if it corresponded with what I felt. Sure enough, the kicks were at exactly the same time I felt them. This confirmation of my experience, and the chance to share it with my partner, was incredibly moving for both of us. It felt like our connection deepened and grew, and we were both filled with awe and excitement. Since then, we have had our baby. There have been many more meaningful moments, but this first shared touch still holds a special place in my heart.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J8OFZ3U,,0.0

I recently went through an unexpected divorce.  I thought I was in a happy marriage until my husband ran off with a younger woman, totally unexpected. I spent the next few months alone but was very unhappy and lonely so I decided to get a companion dog. I didn't want a puppy as I was not interested in training him/her. I started looking into a rescue greyhound from a local rescue. The rescue seem to take the process very seriously and I liked what they stood for. I paid a visit to them with my girlfriend and since it was 50 miles away I was expecting to see a few dogs to choose from. They had two. The first had a lot of medical issues that was a bit much for me  to handle so I did not meet her. The second was a couple of years older than I was anticipating but thought it would be nice to meet her. She was black with while socks and white tip on her tail, very pretty dog. I walked her around the yard and she was so sweet. She did everything I wanted to and seem to have the saddest eyes when she looked up at me. She is 7 years old and seemed to be healthy. She was born in Australia and was raced in China for many years. They closed the race track there and she was kept as one of 600 dogs with no where to go. The rescue group close to me heard of these dogs and was able to get 20 of them out of China. Of the 600 dogs, only 300 were made healthy enough to be rescued out of the country. I couldn't resist, I brought her home. That was 5 months ago. Since then she has become my constant companion. No matter what room I am in, she finds a spot to sit and watch me. Her physical went well and has no known medical issues. Love my dear dog.",35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J7UW3ZQ,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0J7UW3ZQ,0.0

My younger brother was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Since it had spread, he was only given one month left to live. He was only 50 years old at the time. I received a call early in the morning from my nephew. He was in tears saying that his father was in the hospital over a diagnosis of lung cancer. I was in shock to hear this since I had only recently spoke to him a few months ago over the phone and he seemed fine. After arriving to the hospital, the doctor shared the news that he didn't have much longer to live. We cried and shared funny stories of our past. I made sure he was feeling comfortable. Since his chances of survival were so low, he refused chemotherapy. It just didn't make since given his prognosis. I helped him ensure his will was in order. He wanted to make sure I kept a close eye on his wife and son since he knew they would have a difficult time coping without him. And in the last weeks of his life, we made sure to spend as much time together as we possibly could - just enjoying ourselves like we used to when we were younger.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0JAD9Z34,0.0

I'm not a conspiracy theorist or anything, but the things that happened today really makes me wonder about it now. So when I got back to my room at the hotel I wrote to my friend about it all. I just wanted to hear their opinion on the matter. Then the strangest thing happened. My laptop froze up. Yeah, I know most people would write it off as a minor technical issue and reboot it, but it's literally a brand new laptop I bought just before the trip. Like I said, I'm not a conspiracy theorist but this happening to a brand new laptop right after I wrote an email to a buddy and tried to send it out of the country. I really wonder now if people really are that suppressed here. I never took the great firewall seriously. But it is defiantly real now I think.

I went out walking the night before but I went in the direction of the Forbidden City to see how far it was. In the morning I turned east, in the opposite direction. I wanted to see what lay down that direction. The traffic was already loud on the road, a six-laner crowded with trucks and cars. Bicycles too filled the bike lane and some riders came up on the sidewalk so I had to avoid them. I passed a lot of upscale businesses, western clothiers and jewelers. Then I came to an intersection with another wide road. It actually passed overhead in a raised highway. In the shadow of the over pass, at one corner, a police van was parked and some officers were watching the traffic. Quite randomly they waved certain bike riders over to the curb and began questioning them. The police made the riders produce papers, which they examined. They made the bike riders wait quite a while. One older man just sat on the curb and threw up his hands and started smoking a cigarette. I watched this go on quite a while. There seemed no rationale for the riders who were pulled over and those allowed to go past. I walked back to the hotel and began an email to a friend, telling about what I had seen. I also mentioned some other things I had observed. Within 30 seconds of pressing Send, my email program froze. Within another minute, my laptop locked up completely. There was nothing I could do. Even the mouse was stalled. I shut it down and tried later in the day and everything was fine. But now I knew just how closely I was being monitored.",,35GCEFQ6I6A81L0SQUU09O0JJAW3ZY,0.0

She had cancerous cells found in her ovary and it was a relatively simple and minor surgery. They had taken her back for her pre-op checks and everything seemed to be fine.

He said it happens sometimes with patients and that they were going to postpone the surgery to do more tests and see how she does. They ran tests and it seemed to be a fluke that it happened since everything came back normal and healthy. A week later she had the surgery without any complications.

She read online about the train going down to California.  It was highly romanticized but it did look nice.  We got a sleeper car and looked at the scenery.  It surprised me that the food was so good.  However, one of the really suprising thing was the people we met.  When they seat you at dinner they put you with strangers so there is a formality of introducing yourself and telling your travel story.  The stories were so interesting and my daughter and I could not stop talking about them.  In our divided country, meeting all these people from different areas of the country, politics was not mentioned once.  It was really amazing.  One person was nearly 94 but he appeared to be in his seventies.  One couple was from the phillipines.  One man was laid off and took a low end job and he admitted that his parents were supporting him.  There was such a raw emotional quality to the dinner stories that my daughter and i kept talking about them and how emotional it felt about our story.  Because with each story we heard, we had to tell the person our story.  We had to tell our hopes and dreams and failures and it became very raw and personal.  Previous to this trip, my daughter and I had been not very close.  This was making me a little sad because we used to be very close.  But through the rawness and honesty of the stories we heard, she began telling me things that she had been hiding from me.  What's more, she really wanted to know things that I don't tell her or tell my husband.  It was so suprising, because normally if you found out you had to eat dinner with a stranger, you would not be happy.  Yet through the stories of strangers I feel closer and more focused than ever.   When she was little we were so close.  However, as she became a teenager we have a more strained relationship.  But after this trip we are as close as ever.",35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCE6POEO,35GMH2SV3F3ZCF2ID50FCHXCE6POEO,0.0

I worked so hard to get my degree, struggling while working a job, taking care of two kids, my ex husband and my elderly mother in law. It was such a triumph when I got my degree. About six months ago, I lost my job due to the negligence of another nurse, and because of the belligerent new nurse manager who has had it in for me from day one. His firing of me was, I believe, retaliation for having gone to the union to report him last year. Allow me to explain what happened that caused me to lose my job. I worked in the psychiatric ward. I work, or worked rather, nights, and I am the charge nurse. This means of course that I am in charge. On the job I have my Assistant, or Nurse's Aide, and one other nurse. On slow nights, the hours drag and it can be very boring. On nights such as the full moon, it is pure chaos. The night in question happened to be a slow night, as we had only three patients and all of them were in bed asleep. During the course of the night, a fourth patient was admitted. This woman, in my informed opinion, was not so much having a mental episode, but was high on drugs. She did have some signs of mental illness. She was quiet and sweet, and just sat on the floor near our station counter, drawing artwork. On this particular night my Nurse's Aide wasn't there, and it was only me and the other nurse. I got sick during the night and had to go to the bathroom for an extended stay. The other nurse's job was to cover our station and maintain order. However while I was gone, the patient escaped. The other nurse did not even notice her get up, steal her keys from off the counter, unlock the door and leave. Nothing bad happened to the patient; she called someone from home and they came and picked her up. The next day she called to say that she wanted her cellphone back as she had left it when she escaped. Still because I am the charge nurse, both I and the other nurse were fired.",35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58J5A65H,35H6S234SBM9RQ3L28LIRN58J5A65H,0.0

I saw a very small dog being chased by a larger dog. The larger dog was really fast and off leash so by the time the owner of the large dog realized what was happening, it was too late. The small dog was also off leash as well and I think it might have been a run away. I don't think the small dog realized what was happening and that it was in danger. I was very close to the small dog when I was watching this situation unfold. I was a little afraid that if I intervene that, I might get bit by the large dog. I chose to take the chance of getting bitten by the large dog to help save the smaller dog. I turned my back to the large dog to kind of create a blockade between it and the small dog. I scooped up the small dog and held it close to me. By this time, the large dog had reached me and it's owner was right behind it. The large dog barked loudly at the smaller dog in my arms. The owner of the large dog finally grabbed him and pulled him away from me and the small dog. I was pretty angry at the owner of the large dog for being careless. I raised my voice slightly as I told the owner of the large dog that his dog could have killed the small dog in one bite. The owner apologized profusely and finally snapped a leash onto the large dog's collar. After a few minutes, the large dog and it's owner were gone and I was left holding the small dog not knowing what to do with it. It had no tags on it and there was no one in site that it could possibly belong to. I took the little dog to a place where they checked for microchips, and I got lucky. Much to my happiness, the small dog had a microchip and I was able to reunite it with it's owner.",,35L9RVQFCP469UDHZSKUWQME0XNUHV,0.0

I’m planning to surprise her with maternity dresses and baby stuff. As a soon to be “dad” I did a research about healthy pregnancy and parenting. After that day, we decided to tell our families that we are having a baby soon. Me and my wife started to think of baby names. Just because it’s our first baby, I made a design plan for our baby’s room. That is like the last piece of the puzzle I think because that little bundle of joy just completed not only me but our family.

We met on a dating app and spoke nearly everyday for about one month before we had our first date. It had been a while since I had been on a date. So, I thought I would feel very nervous. But surprisingly, I stayed calm. There was a lot of good, fun, and lighthearted conversation. He made me laugh throughout the night, which I liked. He seemed to be a bit nervous throughout dinner. So, I wasn't completely surprised when he spilled some of his water onto the table. It was a memorable moment, but we both laughed it off. I think the fact that we laughed it off made him feel less nervous. We talked about work, hobbies, and random topics that were popular in the news. In the end, it was a good date. I had a good time. And, before I even made it home, he texted me to tell me that he had had a good time as well. I was happy about that.",35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45UZD16NX,35USIKEBNS2DHF9R68H4L45UZD16NX,0.0

I didn't know it at the time but I was one of the very few thay got the best view of both crashes. I was just in the right place at the right time. After the event I quickly uploaded both videos and in a week I got a combined 20k views from them on facebook. This was a major accomplishment for me because my channel is small. This launched my media page from 400 to 530 likes practically in 2 days. This was a big confidence boost for me. I wasn't ready to give up but with all the obstacles that I face this year i felt like I was gonna be left behind.  Ironically this videos lead to me getting into tracks for free. Something that's helped me financially and makes me want to work harder. Its made me more confident  to book more races next year. This is because I'm beginning to build a reputation. I've been very fortunate to have something like that happen to me and want to do it again. This is not the ending but only the beginning. And hopefully this doesn't become a one hit wonder.,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQHQXFIH,3634BBTX0PGHM7RBAL7GA2MQHQXFIH,0.0

All sort of interesting things to climb were scattered  about on the lowest level, including a big spiderweb of ropes to climb. This merriment has a backdrop of giant hills, a few peaked by interesting art sculptures. Our family played and played, we climbed those hills with joy. I was so surprised when I found there was a super fun zip line that had me whooping with happiness. My husband had a blast on it too. My kid that was old enough did one slow easy turn, with great encouragement. We picnicked after we had played and played for a while. We had yummy chicken salad sandwiches and cookies. My husband always gets excited when we use his way too pricey YETI cooler and was bragging about how cold it kept the sandwiches.  After a few more trips up and down the hills we grew tired.

There wasn't much time in the day that I was taking to relax or reflect, and it was really starting to wear on me. I had just piled on more and more deadlines at work, thinking that I could do it all, but I was wrong. I was starting to get fatigued, and my work was suffering because of it. I was having an especially bad night, and I wanted to just give up, but I had a friend over who wouldn't let me. She told me that I needed to keep going, and basically that she believed in me, and in my ability to finish what I started. She told me that I was the hardest worker she knew, and that I was inspiring to her. She said that if I gave up, it would let her down, and that she knew I wouldn't let her down. That really helped, and it really touched me that she felt that way about me. It wasn't quite enough, though, as I was still very burned out. She told me to take the night off, and while I was relaxing, she went out and bought some things. She bought us some good food for dinner, as well as some nice wine to enjoy after.  Then, she cooked me dinner, which was really good. After that, we just relaxed, listening to music and drinking wine, not having any care about work or deadlines. It was only one night, and it didn't solve the issue of being burned out, but it did give me some more fuel to keep on going and finish my projects. I am really thankful that she did that for me, and I am lucky to have her as a friend.",,36AHBNMV1SY6ENSKNXYT8QDT4UMYD7,0.0

I was excited and looking forward to the event. I was with my niece, my sister and my significant other. We took a car going in the city and the car ride in itself was fun. We got to see a lot of people, shops and interesting city life along the way. When we got to Times Square, we took a lot of pictures. There were again, we were surprised at the sea of of people. People from all over the world. I could hear different languages spoken everywhere. We also get to see a group of Eagle Scouts from Germany chanting the Eagle Scout pledge in German. I could hear faint whispers of Japanese. And on the other side of the street you can hear a group of friends talking in Korean. We started trekking the whole street of Times Square. There were a lot of tourist-y shops around. We went inside a shop that was filled with a lot of young tourists. We were curious so we went in and checked it out. It was a shop called BTS21. They was a lot of cute stuffed toys, apparel and cute knick knacks that appeal to young people. My niece was so excited that she bought a lot of stuffed toys. I tried to calm myself down in order not to spend a lot in the store. When we have filled ourselves with cuteness overload, we stopped by a hotdog stand and got ourselves hotdogs. New York natives call this dirty dogs. I was curious as to how it got it's nickname. It turns out the hotdogs are cooked in a vat of hot water with some seasonings and stays in there until a customer buys one. It gets scooped up from the hot vat of water, put in a bun and gets added with either ketchup or mustard. It was a fun experience for me,",,36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4V1VJO0,0.0

This event was almost two months ago to the day when I went back to Michigan for my friends wedding and it changed the way I saw our relationship. To give some context we have had some tough times and ups/downs as friends and kind of lost the original closeness we had which was sad. There were some times where we had this big fights and our relationship had changed. When I went back for the wedding we spend a lot of time together and it felt like old times again. At one point he called me his best friend when we were in a group and I almost wanted to get teary because I had not heard him say something like that in a handful of years. It was really meaningful for me as an individual and I also think for us as a couple of friends as stupid as it sounds. One night we stayed up until about four am just sitting outside looking at the stars and telling dumb stories of things we used to do when we were younger. While we can never go back to that time exactly, it was really great feeling good again and knowing that we were friends without having to feel uncomfortable like we sometimes used to. We played ping pong and jammed on instruments, to be honest we also had some drinks while we were doing all of this! If we would have had more time we probably would have watched a movie but the guy had a wedding the next day! And then the day of the wedding it was just so great to see him happy and married. It was like everything bad that happened before didn't matter and we could go back to being best friends. Nothing else mattered, all of the fights and stupid things we got mad about.

We met family that still live in the country. We ate a lot of good food. Some of it was spicy!! I really enjoyed staying with relatives. I don't speak the language well, but it was good to practice. My relatives were very patient. We visitied a lot of different places. Since they live there, we were able to visit places off the beaten path. We didn't just go to the touristy places. We enjoyed the nightlife of Seoul. I wish I could live there. It is very expensive though. I could never afford to live there.",,36DSNE9QZ6K7NVOAR6B69XA4BTQJOV,0.0

Today my big brother would be starting his senior year or high school and I my freshman year. Earlier this year he was involved in a car accident after his junior prom. Why do people drink and drive? I should be getting my drivers permit pretty soon but my parents aren't exactly thrilled for me to be driving soon. I can understand, it has been a traumatizing experience for me as well. But I know they could use the help with running errands and taking my little sister to school. My brother was always so helpful, he was like superman. Captain of the basketball team, on the honor roll, popular and still made time to help us with homework and getting where we needed to be when mom and dad were working long hours. Ever since he died things have been quiet at home. We try not to being him up much and when we do, we smile and then immediately get saddened that we can't hear just one more joke. He and a few friends had been involved in an accident with a drunk driver who is now in prison, this wasn't his first DUI but we are praying it is his last. I hope they put him away for a long time. My brother's life wasn't the only one that was lost that night. Two other individuals from his basketball team were in the car with him, twins to a single mom who lives just down the street. I see her from time to time when I ride my bike around the neighborhood. She looks sad, lonely. I know just the feeling. My brother was the only one who didn't make me feel invisible. I miss him so much and hope I make him proud throughout these next few years in high school.",,36NEMU28XGZ5TC3XLPF86JF7QJ9MWZ,0.0

My Wife and I just arrived in Portland, Oregon. It is our first time to the city. The airport was older, but still OK, we did not spend much time there. We took a lyft to our hotel, and the driver informed us about a protest that was scheduled for that day. We were unaware of that protest. The driver told us that the proud boys, anti-fa, and the pride rally were all meeting to protest one another. The protests started peaceful, until the protesters began to interact. At the time, the proud boy group was mostly tame, which is out of character for the group. Surprisingly, anti-fa began attacking the pride rally. I was not expecting this, i thought both groups were aligned on the same side of the political spectrum. Anti-fa attacked pride members with ""concrete milkshakes"" which were milkshakes make with quick dry concrete. This attack happened a block from our hotel. A few hours into the ""protest"" homeland security dressed in full tactical gear were dispatched and took control of the square where the protests were happening. This was a shock to my wife and I. We were not expecting this when we arrived to Portland! Turns out, this is fairly common in Portland. The hotel only told us to avoid the protests, and they did not seem surprised by the officers in tactical gear. One of the most odd experiences we had was the next morning. We ate breakfast at a food truck that was parked in the square where the protests happened. We ate breakfast in a peaceful square on a beautiful morning, like nothing had happened just a few hours before. It was truly an interesting start to our trip and something i will not soon forget.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QT3XJF3,,0.0

This year we managed to convince a new friend to go with us on top of our usual group. We traveled there during the middle of the day and were lucky enough to not have to deal with any snow this year. The previous year was quite snowy when we were driving up. We also managed to get lucky and get a room with a balcony again. We try our best to get one every year but since so many people are going it's often tricky to not find them all booked already. The balcony adds a really nice relaxing place to hang out where you can still see some of the event while taking a break up at your room, it really adds to the experience. The event has a 24-hour arcade that runs every day and we have found over the years that it's best to be up and night and sleep during the day. That way you get to enjoy the arcade with less people and can sleep when everything is super crowded. This year especially I mostly focused on the arcade so I was asleep a lot during the day and just stayed up all night. You also have to be careful about where you get food and when because of how busy everything is. Typically we get a bunch of snacks and things for our room to have something as filler since we aren't sure when we might manage to eat. We also try to make at least one trip to a nearby steak place every year we go, as well as a trip to the local Chinese food place. We did our best to teach our new attending friend our tricks but we mostly let him enjoy whatever he wanted to do and he ended up liking the event a lot which is good. I believe he managed to get something signed by a composer he likes. I hope he comes again next year and we can have another addition to our yearly crew. Overall it was a great time and I look forward to going again early next year. This is so far the main thing I do reliably every year so I hope we get to keep doing it. Hopefully we get lucky with the balcony room again and manage to not have it be too cold or snowy during the event itself.",36H9ULYP63GDHIBHS3SGM31QM0DJF6,,0.0

My wife, 2 daughters and I traveled from coastal San Diego to the Palomar Mountain area where we camped outdoors for several nights in April of 2019.  While it was Spring time, the elevation of the campsite atop the mountain made for a very cold camping experience.  We arrived on the first afternoon to the campsite.  We were one of a total of 4 families camping at a campsite that could accommodate 50 campers, so that should have been our first clue that we might have picked a bad time to go camping.  We were very organized in that all of our camping gear was packed  well in our car such that we were easily able to extract things like the tent first.  After we had the tent erected, we placed the air mattresses inside of it and prepared the sleeping bags, and organized our clothing.  Once all of that was set-up, I decided to take a nap in the car (since I was still fighting off a lingering head cold) so my wife took our daughters to go for a short hike.  About at hour later my wife returned and we began to make preparations for dinner by setting up the fire.  While I had no experience camping, by wife had a reasonable amount of experience, so she was able to get the fire going without too much difficulty.  However, as we were warming dinner and the sun began to set, the temperature began to plummet.  My daughters and I began throwing on more and more layers of clothing in order to keep ourselves warm.  My wife, who was hovering over the fire while tending to the food, was not overly cold but she was stunned at how chilly it was getting so quickly.  I sat by the fire, eagerly awaiting dinner, with my two daughters crammed onto my lap as I sat in one of our folding camping chairs.  We ate dinner and the girls happily made smoores afterwards, but that didn't last long as the temperatures dipped into the 30's!  We put out the fire and retired to our tent in order to get some sleep.  We rearranged all of the sleeping bags and air mattresses so that we had 2 people in each one: myself and my smallest daughter in one, and my wife and older daughter in the other.  I was wearing 3 sweatshirts and had 2 extra blankets over me, but that was just barely enough to keep me from shivering all night long.  When the sun arose, we quickly started another fire, but quickly ran through the remainder of our firewood just to keep from shivering constantly all morning long.  After the sun was fully up, we were able to hike and bird watch, then enjoy a filling lunch.  However, as the sun began to drop in the sky the second day, the temperatures plunged too much.  We opted to take down the tent, re-pack the car, and head home so that we wouldn't have to endure another frigid (by San Diego standards) night on the mountain.  In spite of the cold, this was a fun first camping adventure with my wife and kids and I look forwards to doing it again.",,36TFCYNS45WYQY7C4XVHGXLIASUXHM,0.0

My parents told me that I couldn't have one for years and years, but getting my pet bunny in a magic show two months ago was so cool! The magician made a rabbit disappear and then reappear under my seat, and they let me adopt it after the show! My mom originally gave me a dirty look, but she couldn't say no to that cuddly little face. They even let me and my mom meet the magician and other assistants backstage. They did a pretty cool trick for me with a red ball that they didn't do during the show. My mom was blown away! When we got home my dad wasn't exactly thrilled about the bunny, especially since the little guy pooped on the kitchen floor right when we walked in. I had to clean it up, which was pretty gross. My parents told me they were happy that I was being responsible. The next morning we went shopping for supplies at the local pet store. Mom and dad were pretty cool about it too, and let me pick out a nice cage, a bunch of specific food, and some toys. The cage I got is massive and has multiple spots for food trays, which is perfect. It's just so funny how my parents always said I wasn't responsible enough to have a dog or a cat, and now I have a bunny. I'm just glad they came to their senses!",,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38JE3PYKG,0.0

I was in a 5 year relationship with a woman who lived in another country. When we decided to be together, I remember like it was yesterday. Getting my passport, and buying the plane ticket seemed small in the entire thing. What was really the big deal was getting on an airplane for the very first time. Being afraid of flying made this hard enough, but the excitement of going to another country on the other side of the world to meet the woman I loved overcame all of it. Her and I made plans to meet up at the airport when I arrived, and what we where going to do. When I got there, departed the plane, went through immigration,  and got my belongings she was no where to be seen. I waited for several hours outside the airport, trying to call her phone. When she finally answered, she told me she could not come to the airport. She asked me to just get a hotel and she would see me the next day. I was left in a foreign country alone I had no idea about, holding flowers and chocolates I brought for her. Looking foolish, I then decided to just get a taxi to a nice hotel for the night to relax from the jet lag, and decide what to do from there.  The next morning, she called me. She said she could not meet me that day either, maybe the next day she could. Her family called me, randomly, and said out of respect for me going all the way there they felt it was the right thing to do to tell me my girlfriend of 5 years had another boyfriend, and was pregnant. That she had been scamming me the entire time.",36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J707KY7,36U2A8VAG2LESTYUFEKGC38J707KY7,0.0

We had been dating for 7 months at the time, but had known each other for nearly a year.  This particular friend is probably my closest female friend.  We share a lot about our love lives, even though we don't see each other super often.  She knows that I'd been really happy in my relationship and was eager to meet him.  It finally so happened that schedules aligned and we were able to meet up.  I was a little nervous at first.  I wasn't worried that she wouldn't approve or anything, but it's always a little bit of an unsure situation introducing people you're dating to old friends. We met at the restaurant, a local burger joint/bar.  The three of us had a great time! Conversation was easy, and as expected, they got along wonderfully.  Some mutual friends showed up at the restaurant, and we had a brief conversation with them before heading to her house.  Once there, we spent a while playing with my friend's dog.  My boyfriend made fast friends, and it was really sweet seeing him interact with her dog.  Overall, we had a wonderful time, and I'm sure that my significant other made a good lasting impression on a very important friend of mine.",36WLNQG780WFTLD990VT6XXD11KEB6,,0.0

They weren't allowing the newer people to the construction site until they all took tests and safety courses. Alex had done these before with the company and instead of giving the refresher, they went ahead and let him do the jobs. Well, he had forgotten about a helmet and went he bent down to pick up a tool, he got smashed in the front of his face with a steel beam. The beam was being rose from the ground to the next floor and someone had given the ""all clear"" despite Alex being there. The beam smashed him in the chin and jaw and did some damage.

During this time, I have gotten to know my practicum supervisor and have had the opportunity to learn a lot about the students who attend the school. In particular, I have gotten to know the Kindergarteners and first graders very well. There is one particular kindergartener, a blonde-haired little boy with none of his front teeth and a long braid down his back, that I have come to enjoy seeing around school. About two weeks ago, he came up to me and was crying. He grabbed me in an embrace and told me how much he wanted ""Picture Day"" to last all day. His mother had dressed him up and styled his braid with extra care that morning. He clearly was very excited about how nice he looked but was having a hard morning. He looked very precious and it put a smile on my face. He shared with me that he was feeling sad and really needed a friend that morning. We got him his breakfast and made our way into my office. After opening up his chocolate milk and juice cartons, he started to cry and leaned his head against the wall. He doubted that he could make it through the whole day without getting his picture taken at least twice. I felt sad to see him so upset. He jumped up from his chair and hugged me around my waist, still crying. I talked to him about how hard school can be and how brave he was. He told me that he felt better. The other day, he picked up his school pictures and I found a portrait signed by him sitting on my desk. It made me feel very happy and loved by this little boy I had come to know so well.",,374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSN9FYQG,0.0

This was a big event for our household, as our child has always been in my care exclusively.  It felt painful to send her away for a 6 hour school day. I wondered if she was happy, listened to, understood,  if she was hungry for a snack that she was accustomed to having, if she made friends, who she played with at recess, etc. I kept busy at home with my younger daughter,  but our routine was fractured. My daughter was missing her big sister,  and I was missing my big girl who helped me with her little sister.  During the first week of school, I reminded myself that this was my big girl's new chapter in life, her journey to growing into a big kid. This right of passage was to be expected,  and that we all have survived without our parents watchful eyes. I found it interesting that we spend so much of our child's early years carefully watching over them, only to have to release that nurturing grip to a stranger. As funny as it sounds, I had think back to my years in elementary school. I considered what my parents had to do, releasing my care to strangers, and it helped me bridge this new chapter that I was on the other end with my child. I was able to better prepare my child and myself for this new schedule. The daily pep talks calmed my inner mama bear. I no longer fought with anticipation to camp out at her school, just a good joke to remind myself that she was fine and I would be as well. Now that she is 3 months into this new routine, we are satisfied, she is in love with her school, and I feel like the competent mama bear that I knew I would be.",374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSD98QYR,,0.0

I got my start in a great company but like many others say appreciate what you have now because on day it can be gone. In this case though I have to say don't always look back at memories and be prepared for whats to come. The company that I loved to work for got bought out by a major conglomerate in the business. We all were worried about losing our jobs which they assured was not the case. Sometimes somethings are better left unsaid. My entire department was let go in one swoop but were picked up by another service company in the same industry. We all knew we were just buying time at that point and i noticed one by one several of my coworkers were going there own way. Luckily for me i was headhunted by my former manager to another job which i didn't think was a great opportunity at the time. IN the mean time of all this moving I was keen becoming part of this company I've always been fond of, some of my coworkers even started working there. For 2 years i applied and most of the time did not receive a response. Then one day the call came, I was so excited i ran around my block with joy. The salary they promised was so outstanding and just the fact i would work with familiar faces made me so excited. To this day i love where i work, and I even intend on going to college to further pursue my career within the company. How my life changed since that day is something i will never forget. I will always never forget the path it took to get here and most importantly how God was able to guide me.",374TNBHA8CH03WWPSJ4D8PKSCMPQYX,,0.0

Mike, along with several other co-workers, and I went to this restaurant because I suggested it would be a great place to have lunch. As usual, everything was going great. The employees were friendly, the food was delicious and the atmosphere was very pleasant. Towards the end of our lunch, it started getting really busy. We were almost done eating and wanted to get our sopapillas and our check so we could get back to work. There was a busboy running around trying to keep ahead of all the customers so Mike decides to get the busboy's attention. He yells out, ""Hey, Pedro!"" to this young kid. I was absolutely mortified. I asked what the hell he was doing and he said he calls all Hisphanic guys, Pedro. He didn't see anything wrong with it. I did tell him how insensitive his remark was but he thought I was being overly-sensitive. I wanted to crawl under a rock.

The candidate at the event was in Downtown Los Angeles at a park. I had seen many interviews with him online before I attended the rally. I started to believe in his vision when I heard him on podcasts. I had never gone to a political event in my life but was really encouraged to attend this one. A big reason that motivated me was the fact that he was spreading a message that was so profound but no one else knew about. He had no political background so his name recognition was next to nothing. I didn't want to tell too much people about it because I didn't think that they would care enough to come with me. I only told one friend who I knew would be interested. The scene at the rally was amazing. It included so many people from different backgrounds. I'm not religious at all but it felt like we were listening to the words of our savior. Everything he said made so much sense. As the event ended, the crowd cheered ""ANDREW YANG"". There was so much energy on the train ride back home. I never knew that politics could be that impactful.",379J5II41P2R6UZL0DKNK0TIB3SLE8,,0.0

It was hard to believe that i would cross paths with them out of the blue like this. I hadn't seen them in person since our time together at work. They had moved out of town to take a job in a different city but we still tied to keep contact over social media. Eventually we ended up losing touch with each other and so I hadn't heard from them in quite some time. We were quite excited to see bump into each other and immediately embraced. It felt super awesome to be able to talk to Bobby after so long a time. We talked a bit and got caught up on what had been happening in our lives up to this point. He mentioned that he was visiting his parents and that they happened to be out that day, just hanging out and such. It was a nice day to out indeed and seeing my friend made it that much better. After we talked a bit more, we decided to have lunch together the following day. It was great to hear a bit more in-depth about some of the various experiences that had taken place over the course of time that had transpired. I really felt refreshed and invigorated after spending time with my buddy.",37FMASSAYDDR9QFV5JLKRCV5032BIC,,0.0

The time for my graduate studies finals was fast approaching and I had been wracking my brain over all of the content that I had to master within the next two weeks. The stress was growing more and more overwhelming with each passing hour. It eventually got to the point where I started facing a bout of insomnia. No matter what I tried, I could not bring myself to fall asleep. This grew more problematic after several days of being unable to drift of into sleep. I was having difficulty commuting to class and paying attention to what the professors were saying. After several days, I began to find it difficult to distinguish between what was reality and what was illusion; a common symptom of insomnia. The most unsettling perception I encountered was a group of children unknown to me. They were playing together in a field within a park. As they ran around, they began to extend their hands toward a nearby playground. I could see some kind energy emanating from their fingers. Almost instantly after this began, the metal implements on the playground began to move on their own. Some tore out of the ground and began to whirl around in mid air. The children were creating their own magnetic waves and were thus able to manipulate metal around them. It reminded me of the character Magneto from the X-Men comics, though the children did not appear to have any malevolent intent. When I finally snapped out of this vision, I was honestly uncertain about whether or not what I had seen was real. Sleep deprivation had obviously gotten the better of me. It wasn't until my finals were over that I was finally able to get some sleep. Having had time to rest and put finals behind me, the perceptions from this experience have begun to coalesce in my consciousness and I find myself needing to figure out what the experience meant.",,37C0GNLMHGP4V3IEHE31PZT0WM2D6Q,0.0

Mark and Alyssa were there, and even Rodney showed up for a little while. I hadn't seen Rodney in ages! There were a couple people there that I didn't know, but most of them were our friends from back in high school.  I remember Mike, Rodney and I used to get into so much trouble skipping class! Anyways, I had a great time celebrating with friends and seeing everyone. The dinner was tasty and Alyssa even brought some expensive Italian Cabernet for us to try. I think I still prefer a sweeter white zinfandel, but it was alright. After dinner (and dessert), we retired to the living room where we played some games together. Mark led us in an exercise writing poetry, and at the expense of my dignity I shared a couple of haikus that I wrote.  I thoroughly enjoyed the poetry. Our hostess then entertained us by bringing out the old VHS recording of their wedding and reception. Crazy to think that it has been 20 years already! Everyone looked so young in the video. Our lives have all gone off in different directions, what with Rodney moving to the big city and Alyssa traveling the world as a freelance writer and journalist. Even Mike moved away to the country to start a vineyard. It was great being able to catch up with everyone, and I hope we are able to get together like that more often.",,37KGEN7NJ4CLU6391JT5VT16E68PP0,0.0

In the center of the yard was a table with gift boxes and cards. I was overwhelmed and still in disbelief as i have never had something like this so much joy and pride in one place at the same time. Eveyone was talking and laughing, kids running around the yard.  I grabbed my plate and feasted upon the food the had prepared. I ate, drink and dance and the end of the night we played games and i opened my gifts. I received gift cards for my favorite restuarants, cash, jewelry and the greatest of all a new car from my husband, I could not hold back the tears as it burst from my eyes.

Have a goal, achieve it, but decide something else is more important. It was a baseball game around the beginning of the season. And if you're an adult male that's loved sports their whole life, one of the bucket list items is to catch a foul ball at a game. I still remember this moment months later, and how it felt. The headline was man catches foul ball, which probably happens dozens of times each baseball game, but the better story is how I made a friend after catching it. I remember it being late in the game, and a ball was lofted in my direction. The stands were nearly empty so I figured I had a shot at it. It was going to land short. It bounced way short actually, hit a railing and deflected into my chest. Unfortunately I was still holding my beer at this point, so it caused it to soak my entire shirt, but who cares?! I grabbed the ball, but after I had it a minute, it didn't feel as special as I thought it would be. So I found a little kid I had been watching nearby for much of the game, and gave it to him. He was so happy he hugged me. His parents appreciated that as well, and we wound out talking the rest of the game (it was a boring game) about life, philosophy, just a regular nice conversation that matters that we tend to overlook in life.

We decited to visit the truly beautiful island of Jamaca. This place is so amazing it is a real dream come true to be there. The water is perfectly blue. We stayed in a hut on the water and the nightime sounds are just so great. All you hear is the calm night and the water slowly moving by. What does this woman think of? Her child, I thought that if I got away I would be nothing but happy, but I missed my kids the whole time. All and all I think I will not do this again. I love my kids too much and things would be better with them. The next time I go on vacation I will take my children becuase they mean the world to me.

He has always had a musical ear. Since childhood, he has been fascinated with music and musical instruments. He started wanted to play Spanish guitar because his family was from Spain. Flamenco guitars in Spain are trendy and is typical to find spontaneous musicians playing on the streets. He was so good that he started to play in a number of local clubs and started to earn significant money with it. His family was so proud of him because he was somehow promoting his heritage by playing the Spanish guitar. But all of a sudden one day about 20 years ago Jake went to a piano concert, and he just fell in love with the instrument. He started to study and practiced almost every day. His family was initially disappointed that he switched the instrument, but he also proved to be a very gifted pianist. Then, ten years ago, he was involved in a terrible car accident, which resulted in his left arm being amputated.  He was devastated for a month. Then, he decided he was not going to let that tragedy stop his dreams, and for years after that, he practiced piano with one hand only. He became so adept at it that he was invited to play in the London Philharmonic. That was the proudest day of his life and everyone around him.",,37M28K1J0RZILRU9HN6O82QZXR5AJB,0.0

For many years, she was the babysitter to myself and my siblings. She would make us warm tea, tell us stories of when she was a young child, and share her words of wisdom about many things. Life made sense because of her. I knew she was getting old, but I refused to believe that she would ever leave this Earth. She has been my inspiration and my rock as a pillar of wisdom as I grew into the young professional I am today. However, she passed away three months ago. She died peacefully in her sleep overnight. Unfortunately the costs of her death and burial was substantive. My father started working two jobs. My mother took up another job herself. Saying this event was emotionally and financially stressful may be an understatement. Though we were there for one another, we all wanted space to ourselves as we grieved over her. Therefore, I had an idea. I looked online for resources available to assist grieving families. To my chagrin, I found that there aren't many resources dedicated to this phenomenon. This is depressing, but we will fight, and we will overcome and remember grandma in our hearts.",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E68JBQ,0.0

I am finding more to do. It's amazing that not going to a group will expand your horizons. Atleast it has for me. I have recently been doing alot of sewing on my own and loving it. Changing the way clothes look. Altering clothes and trying different things with fabric. The different ways to use fabric has been a real challange to me and one I relish.

I seen tickets for a band I had wanted to see and was a fan of for years. It was right there I knew that we were going to drive up and make it happen. Some of the music of this band highlighted my teenage years and I never had time to go to shows because of demands of work and monetary reasons. We set out to get floor seat tickets and I was actually intrigued by where the concert was taking place. The ride up to Nebraska wasn't that bad and we got to see a lot of corn fields and stuff I haven't seen in awhile. There was a lot to look forward to once we arrived at the hotel. There was some decent restaurants around and we took a chance on a pizza place which turned out to be great. Afterwards, we headed to the venue which was a good sized arena. I was happy that there was so many people that came together. I had been waiting awhile to get to see some of my favorite bands leave behind an awesome experience. After a couple beers, we went inside and prepared to go in. I had never been in the mosh pit before and was looking forward to it. The first band played which was Behemoth and they rocked it. My shoulder got hit, but I popped it back into place. Gojira then went on and made an impact with their aggressive, but powerful songs. I enjoyed a little bit of Volbeat which is another hard rock type of band that has catchy songs. Then the best of all, Slipknot was due to go on after a good break. The intensity of the intro they play off their second album was immense. I pretty much lost my voice and was sweating from jumping the whole time. It was more than I imagined and they delivered one of the most energetic sets I have ever seen at a show. They then played one of their new songs which I wasn't expecting and I was a bit emotional about it. It hit home that I got to see Slipknot for the first time ever and I'd never forget how much they gave back to us fans.",37TD41K0AIVZD9AXOVBT6Y7ARN4SCU,37TD41K0AIVZD9AXOVBT6Y7ARN4SCU,0.0

With flowers for mom and gift for baby in hand, I made my way through the hospital hallways, recalling the memories of the birth of my own baby, my now two year old and husband walking alongside me. In the past few months, the baby fever has overwhelmed me, made me giddy with excitement, and brought me to tears. After a very difficult and traumatic labor and delivery two years back, I never thought I would want another one so soon. But here I was walking in the hallways, past the nursery, the faint echo of brand-new baby cries lingering into my heart. It seemed like everyone near and dear to me was either pregnant, or just had a brand new baby, something I long for so bad. But I know, realistically, right now would not be the ideal time for cradles and bibs. That time, I know, is so close, but seemingly so far away. There are things that must be done to prepare; the unchecked list runs through my head every single day. My body needs to be 20-30 pounds lighter. We need to figure out a few financial things. I need to get my dentist work done first. I need to read all the books and do all the research.  My husband, also with his own worries and fears, needs to be on the same page. Somehow my many ""needs"" have put my one major ""want"" on hold, and it's resulted in a sin called envy. I greet another tired mama, stare at another sweet sleeping babe, and hand in hand with my husband, walk out the door. We get into the car, and I let out a heavy, longing sigh. My husband, looks me straight in the eyes. ""What?"" I ask. He doesn't speak, just gives me a small smile. We speak to each other without speaking. I smile back as tears fall down my cheeks. I close my eyes and the list appears. Check. My heart is content.",,37TRT2X24RDN41Z1N16K3DA5E5YBJ6,0.0

If we did decide to ""communicate"", it was usually over yelling matches. Just a toxic environment for our kids--hence, why we are heading to divorce court. Since my husband is the breadwinner, he wants to take my kids from me. He is suing for full custody--limiting my interactions with my two daughters. I might only to get to see them on the weekends.

I walked into school, and held out my hand to him for him to hold. He pushed it away and called me a CHEATER! Diary, like i said I was SO in LOVE, there was no way I would have cheated. I don't know why he chose that as a reason to break up with me because it wasn't the truth. I was so confused because I didn't talk to other boys, and I sure didn't cheat.  He also called me a slut, and let me tell you, that kind of stuff runs through a middle-school quick! It really hurt my feelings.  My good friends stood by me, but people that didn't know me leered at me in the halls. I just rushed to my classes as quick as possible. I was embarrassed to go to school for two whole weeks.

I was hurt by it because, throughout our marriage, we've worked tirelessly to build trust with one another; to cultivate respect and empathy. We've worked to undo the unhealthy lessons of our upbringings and to get past our deeply ingrained insecurities and mistrust for others. We've made great strides. In that moment though, when I discovered this stupid thing he'd hidden from me, I felt like everything that we'd worked for was moot; that it didn't matter to him. We'd built this life with our home, our beloved pets, our mutual hobbies, our nights in laughing on the couch...all of it. We were sitting on our bed together, discussing the issue when we fell into a silence, unsure of where the conversation was going or what good it was doing. I remember tears rolling down my cheeks when I heard our cat, Archie, batting around a small gumball. They're his favorite toys. He doesn't eat them, just bats it around our wood floors for a while until I replace it. My husband and I both heard the tell-tale 'roll, clatter, clatter, roll' when we said, unprompted and in perfect unison: ""Get that gumball, Archie."" We both let out a gasp of a laugh. It was bizarre, both of us uttering this weird concoction of words that no one else has probably ever said. Thinking of them in the same order and at the same time. We smiled quietly and sat in that moment for a little while. It's been a few months since then and I still think about it occasionally, especially when I hear a faint 'roll, clatter, clatter' in another room. I think about our problems as a couple and how we've hurt each other and how it will take time to heal from things.

I don't know how it started but he's taken to batting them around the hard wood floors of mine and my husband's home. He plays with the gum balls (Archie, not my husband) for a week or two, before I throw them out and replace with a new one. I find it wasteful, but whatever, it's his only vice. Both my husband and I find it funny, like we do with everything our animals do. We often bond over our love for them and our shared love of stand up, food, wildlife rehabilitation, coffee and Elvis. We also bond over similar emotional health hurdles that we've dealt with throughout our lives. My husband and I have a host of separate issues resulting from bad childhood trauma on both ends. We've done a lot of reflection and are pretty careful to navigate our problems with respect and compassion for each other. That's not to say we haven't had our fair share of problems though. We've dealt with insecurity, snide remarks, jealousy, trust issues etc. Recently, we were really going through it when I found out he hid something from me that he found embarrassing. It make me question his honesty and ability to communicate with me. I was so upset and felt like a lot of what we had worked on in our relationship was moot. We were both sitting on our bed, my cheeks tear-stained after a long, long talk about the issue. It was pretty silent when we heard a gumball roll across the floor in the adjacent room. My husband and I said, in perfect unison: ""Get that gum ball, Archie."" It was like we'd rehearsed it...This random, bizarre phrase that nobody else has probably ever said. I let out a choked half laugh/half cry and my husband did too. It's really strange. Therapy and self-help books and talking out everything has helped our marriage a lot. It's given us tools to work through bad habits taught to us by our parents and we've managed to navigate through a lot of the toxic muck that often destroys relationships. But sometimes, I think we need the reminder that our lives are really great even with the hard moments and what we've built with our love and our home and our effort and our animals, is something that I'd never trade in a million years. Thank you, Archie. You deserve all the gumballs. Me and CatDad love you a lot.",37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,37UEWGM5HUU3PR0MT9M4ZSJN3EU1R7,0.0

I always sat there in my room, playing with my Barbies, but always wanted someone to play with. Of course I had friends my age, but “they couldn’t live with me,” my mother repeatedly told me after my crying sessions when they left. I wanted someone to mess with and blame things on. If I took the last cookie off the plate, I couldn’t blame anyone. It was clearly me. I mean, I loved being spoiled by both of my parents, but my dad wouldn’t want to sit down and have tea parties with me and my stuffed animals, and my mother got tired of it after an hour or so. So where did that leave me? Alone with Mr. Penguin with his overstuffed white belly, and my favorite pink bear with the bright yellow hat that I can’t remember the name of now. It was hot. Well maybe it wasn’t, but that’s how I felt. I tried to hide the tears that were about to come down by smiling. That always worked. “Cool,” I said. My dad could see that there was some subliminal message that I wasn’t telling him, but he went along with it. I stared into the baby’s big brown eyes, complemented by long eyelashes I envied. He looked back at me and smiled. “Hi Legend, I’m your big sister.” It was a regular day after school, but I decided to go over my dads for a little while before I went home. My dad picked me up from Broad & Olney and on the ride to his house, he blasted some good ole hip hip in his oversized truck. When we reached a parking spot, he stopped me. “Symone, I got a surprise for you.” “What is it,” I said eagerly.",,37W3JXSD67U5NTSB4S3J0E2E2C0YWJ,0.0

He was in town for a little bit in a few weeks and had bought tickets to a baseball game in my city. So we made sure I could make it and planned to meet at the park.

So I kept a close eye on the weather forecast for the day we were to go. Unfortunately it looked like rain and there ended up being a major storm in the morning. Lots of rain and really no sign of it breaking up, until around mid-day where all of a sudden it went away. So we met up and it was actually very nice weather by the time we arrived at the park. There were a lot of people there even with the threat of rain. We had dinner at the park before the game and sat down to watch the game. The people who sat around us were all nice and we had conversations about the game. The game went long and it was an exciting one with lots of action. Unfortunately our team ended up losing in a heartbreaking fashion in the last inning. After the game it took a while to leave the stadium and even longer to get out of the parking ramp I was in. All in all it was great time and everything worked out.",37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6,37UQDCYH6YH9TKW5R98N1ZZ3HRE7V6,0.0

Come on, it's bad enough that I have to listen to her go on about her self, but to be asked to help out with a guy I don't know?! And one I couldn't care less about, at that. I really think I put my foot down with this issue. The boyfriend and our relationship. I told her that I absolutely would not help her bail him out. I let her know, in no uncertain terms, that I won't risk my money on a guy I don't really like, and I couldn't count on him to show up to his court date. Hell, she can't count on him to show up to a regular date with her, so how can he be trusted? She was really pissed off with me, and told me what a terrible friend I was. That's when I lost it. I told her that she may think what she wants of me, but her opinion no longer matters to me. I let her know I am sick of her endless complaining about her job, her family, her boyfriend, and basically life in general. I suggested she get counseling for her issues so she has an non involved party who can help her sort our her problems. I have been there for her since we were in high school, but honestly, I think she's doing drugs or something. She's been a nut job, with a terrible temper for the past couple of years, and I can't deal with it anymore. I really did mean she should seek help, it wasn't just me saying something ugly, although she seemed to take it that way. A big first step would be if that jerk of a boyfriend staying in jail, and quit bringing her down to his level. She needs to get some of her old confidence back. I told her that I do care about her, but I simply can't hang out with her until she gets some real help. That was when she hung up on me, and I haven't heard from her since.

She wanted to go visit her aunt and uncle who we havent seen in a while but we only had a weekend to do it. She bought us 2 train tickets departing at 11:45 PM on friday and we started our 13 hour trek. We got on the train and slept a bit, and woke up around 6. We played some games on the train and grabbed breakfast in the dining car. When we got to the platform my sister was waiting for us and ran up to Elise and gave her a hug. It was nice seeing them and going to their home but there was so much to do and we only had 24 hours. We went to a museum in town and ended up seeing a performance at the local theater where my nephew works. We all grabbed drinks afterward and went back to the house for a fire. It was a whirlwind of a day, but I am glad we did it. Time flew by too quickly and before we knew it we had to rush back to the train station for work. In all the trip was 52 hours with half of it being spent on a train, but I think we would do it again. It was nice spending quality time with Elise and seeing my sister and her husband. Its too bad they moved out of state and we cant see them more. I am so happy i raised such an adventurous girl and hope that leads her to much happiness in her life.",,37XITHEISXVNCUAK96BOGO2E698RC5,0.0

There had never been an event like this before, so it was intense, fun, and only at the price of $15 for admission. Each group that went on showed power, intensity, and all around had a great time. All of the groups on the sidelines cheered on for each other and took pictures and videos of the event and the groups performing. We all had a love for each other that could not be explained. I truly felt part of a community bigger than myself and was proud of each and every group that performed. My greatest surprise were the students attending the event. They danced NON STOP for three hours straight. The physical capability and determination was beyond overwhelming. In the end everyone was exhausted, but so happy at the event turnout. The event was a huge success because we were able to raise a lot of funds and get a lot of donations for the children in Haiti for their upcoming school year. After this event was over, we were already planning to do another event just like this one, and many of the groups were already planning for the future.",37ZHEEHM6X8PHBUM7Z2HI47K0K337N,,0.0

I arrived early at Macys to pick up my customized cape and gown. Prior to my graduation date, my grandmother had said she was going to pay for it in full and by the time I had to pick it up it would be handled. I attempted to grab my cape and gown from the clerk, and she said ""will this be cash or card?"" I was stunned because I thought it was already taken care of. I frantically called my grandmother, and she said she had not made it down here yet. I was frazzled! I had less than 2 hours before graduation, and my cape and gown was not even ready to be picked up. After 45 minutes, she came and made sure to pay off my cape and gown. Now after this minor hiccup, I had 1 hour and 15 minutes until the ceremony. I still had to go to my stylist, and buy shoes! I arrived at the stylist 5 minutes late. She then tells me she took her next client and I would have to wait. I was a mess at this point. I decided I was going to rush to my dorm, and get my own hair ready. I did it in under 30 minutes. It was not what I had planned, but I made it work. With less than 30 minutes left, I had to buy dress shoes now. Upon arriving at the shoe store, I started searching for shoes. It seemed every shoe that matched my gown was not in my size! I ended up purchasing a shoe that was a 1/2 a size too big! I rushed as fast as I could to the ceremony. When I walked in, I went to sit down with my other classmates. They all gave me a strange look. One of them exclaims ""you missed your name being called!"" I was distraught.

We do many social activities together contrary to the computer nerd stereotype. We hike, go to dinners, watch TV shows like silicon valley together, go to workshops, and even Christmas parties.

The first thing that I was asked to do was feed all of the animals. There were were a lot more dogs than there were cats, which made me pretty happy because I don't care for cats that much. I finished doing all of that and watched them all chow down on some good quality kibble that someone had donated the day before. I was told that they don't receive a lot of high quality food donations, so this was really helpful. There are so many dogs here that it takes a large bag of kibble a day just to keep them fed. After feeding them all, it was time to start bathing the new pets that were brought to us this morning. I'm most comfortable washing small dogs, so I washed the 2 pomeranians that were brought in and left the Rottweiler to someone more experienced than me. I loved both of the little fluff balls, but the white one (a girl) was not happy with her bath at all. She was nervous and whining the entire time, while the brown one (a boy) was a champ about the whole thing. I bathed the white one first so she could get out and get dried off I was able to use a blow dryer on her, so she got dry pretty quickly. The boy pom was a lot easier to deal with, so it didn't take me long to bathe him off. They were both infested with fleas, the poor things. I get upset when I see animals mistreated like this. There's no excuse to be eaten up with fleas like that at all. All it takes is a regular bath to keep them mostly off and I don't understand why people can't do that like they're supposed to. I wish I could take both of these babies home with me. I think I'm going to move.",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZF1R6QO,0.0

Though she was only halfway through her pregnancy, she was experiencing some pain and doctors couldn't figure it out. After a few weeks of dealing with it by using pain medication, her condition did not begin to improve. I was starting to get extremely worried. I could only think of my old college roommate, Kim, who went through something similar and ended up losing her child after only a few months. Though I spoke with Julie to reassure her, I remained scared at the possibility of something seriously bad happening. Then, one afternoon maybe five months ago, I received a text from her husband that nearly put me in shock. He said that she was forced into labor early and both her and the baby were on life support. This was the worst news I could have ever imagined. My jaw was on the floor. I wasn't sure what I should do. I called her husband again but he did not answer. That's when I really started to panic. So I rushed to my car and headed straight for the hospital, despite living nearly three hours away. Somehow, by a complete miracle, I received a call when I was roughly 20 minutes away from the hospital. It was Julie's husband to tell me that both Julie and her baby were off life support and were going to be just fine. I felt so relieved! I was able to spend a few hours with them and see the baby, and then prepared to head back home for my three hour journey. What a day!",,386CSBG1O08YKCMJM09LPY0ZDCWQ6X,0.0

My dog Tucker was always full of life and one of the happiest dogs you would ever meet - he was sweet, affectionate, and loyal.  This event took place in June during the late evening at my house.  I came home from work and noticed that I wasn't greeted by my trusty companion and knew something was wrong.  I walked around the house searching for him and calling his name but couldn't find him anywhere.  Finally, I looked under the bed and there he was, just laying there, staring at me with a sad face.  I eventually got him out from under the bed and tried to get him to play but he wasn't interested.  I then tried to feed him (normally he's crazy for dinner) but he wasn't the least bit interested in the food.  Tucker was still very affectionate and wanted me to pet him and give him a hug, but he still wasn't himself.  We laid down on the couch and he sat on my lap and watched tv with me for awhile.  Tucker then got up and went into the living room and started making coughing noises.  I came in and saw that he vomited and that there was blood in it.  After that, things escalated rather quickly, and now Tucker was vomiting everywhere and was in severe discomfort.  I decided to take him to an emergency vet that was open 24 hours near my home.  I found out that he has stomach cancer and there wasn't much I could do for him.  After hours of crying and laying in the room with him, the vet gave him some pain medicine to help him be comfortable.  I kissed him and told him he was a good boy and made the decision to end his pain that day.",,384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59JKNS0Q,0.0

I was in Florence at the time and went to bed feeling a bit melancholy about these friends and past moments in my life. A few hours later I was woken up by a text from a close friend, it was the middle of the night for me but since it was someone texting from the U.S. the time was much earlier for them. The text asked if I had heard about a different friend. I immediately had a sinking feeling in my stomach. I replied that I hadn't, and immediately knew that bad news was coming. He explained that my friend had been found dead on the beach just a few short hours before. I was stunned. My mind was racing. Was this a drowning? Was it an illness? The reality was that my friend had just become another statistic in the opiate epidemic. He had died of a heroin overdose while sitting on the beach. I was devastated. I could not go to sleep and laid restless for the remainder of the night. I got up in the morning and began wandering around the city in a haze. I was on a trip of my life and I could not just sit around and mourn. However, I was tinged with sadness in everything I did. I was in one of the most beautiful cities on earth and everything was a reminder of life, death, friendship, and emotion. My eyes would well up with tears every so often as I attempted to go about my day and visit different sights. It was an unbelievably beautiful day. There was a golden sunlight touching every surface, streaming through windows. I ended the day in the 1000 year old monastery of San Miniato al Monte, thinking about life and how it was so precious and fleeting. I was filled with emotion and remembrance, knowing that I would remember this moment forever, for good and bad reasons.",384PI804XTNFJHFHCFI9BX59JKL0SW,,0.0

It was 10 AM, he was barely holding on, I tried calling the vet and when they came there was nothing they could do. I saw him die in front of me, and I had to bury him that night. I have never felt so devastated. I didn't know what to do, to be honest with you--how do you deal with such a loss? He was my best friend. He was everything to me for so long, I had gotten him from my parents. He's just about as old as I am! Like a little sibling. Or, he was, I guess. He was very kind, but I guess age catches up to us all eventually. I'm in my 30s now, and he was a gift from my parents. They knew how close we were.",,388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DOORR0R,0.0

It was almost unbelievable. I instantly knew that I had to fly out to see him and be with him during this difficult time. It wasn't a cheap trip, by any means, but it was necessary. I waited a few days for things to calm down a bit before finding information about his mother's memorial ceremony. Once that date was concrete I scheduled my flight to be there with him. Once I got to where he lives we spent almost 7 hours just talking about what has been new and how he was doing. It was a great conversation and I'm really happy that we got to have it. We spoke about memories about his mom and memories we all had together. We also got into his feelings and how he was doing with everything. I like to think that that trip helped him out a lot as having a childhood friend there would be comforting. After that night, we had the ceremony the following day and it was incredibly sad. We watched a film reel and her surviving family went up on stage and spoke about her. It was a good experience but it was a sad one as well. My best friend was clearly and understandably emotional during this time but made it through and I could tell that he was incredibly appreciative of the fact that I was there. After that we spent some more time together and I flew back home. We have been in touch consistently since then and he has been doing better.

Back in May I received the news that I was once again being dismissed from the nursing program at Randolph Community College. After putting in sweat, tears and many countless hours I was angry more than anything when I heard the words, ""unfortunately, we cannot let you continue into the program."" I've had time to process my emotions and cry about it, but even now I still feel angry. But why? Because I gave it my all and the instructors led myself and other students to believe that they would help us pass. I'm not angry at myself, I'm angry at the director, I'm angry at the instructors and more importantly, I'm angry at the college. I understand that I got dismissed the first time because I didn't study enough. But this time? This is on them. More importantly, I'm feeling frustrated. When I try to explain this to my dad, he always takes the college's side and says, ""well you knew what you were in for, didn't you?"" Yeah, I knew what I was in for, but that doesn't justify falsely leading students to believe they are ""safe"" and that we will receive help. I try and remind myself that this is now in the past and there's no going back. All I can do is learn from the experience and continue to move forward. Here is to better opportunities and a brighter future. I can't go anywhere but up from here. This is just a bump in the road.",,386PBUZZXGJZHALDEEVEHG6AQ2YLJV,0.0

He had been with me during some of the post painful periods in my life, and I couldn't imagine life without him.  The regular medicines were not working, so we put him on a newer med that I heard could give Pip a couple of extra years, the downside is that they also came with horrible side effects for some dogs.  I think that we all imagine that our pet will not be part of the 20% and that it will be the cure that wee are looking for.  Pip initially responded well and he seemed to be getting back to his old self.  However in a couple of weeks, symptoms, started to show again and we had to up the dose.  A few days later, Pip seemed uncomfortable while I was getting ready for work.  After I dropped the kids off at school, something told me to go back to the house and check on him.  He was lying on his side, foam going from his mouth, panting...the worst part was that there seemed to be a look of terror on his face.  I will never forget that look or forgive myself for giving him those meds.  Pip was put to sleep later that morning.  I continue to research the medication that I had given him to see if anything pops up that I should have noticed before giving it to him.  It's like I can't let go.  It's almost like I have to find ways to continue to punish myself because I am the one who caused that look of fear in his eyes.  I do make it a point to warn anyone I know who's dog develops Cushings about the medication.",388U7OUMF8N3I2F4XQI4LN0DWZ80RB,,0.0

Will he come home happy or feel anxious and lonely in his new school? Will PS3 be a good fit for him? I really wanted this to work out for him. I wanted him to feel welcome and integrate well with his new classmates, teachers and studies.

I went to work that day still worried, but I tried to focus on work and prayed all would be well for him. When it was time to pick him up, I was anxious but I tried to stay calm and optimistic. I waited for him to come out and spotted him walking out with two young boys he was talking to with a smile on his face. I was so relieved. I had hoped he would make friends quickly and I couldn't wait to ask him about his first day! he saw me and came towards the car as he said goodbye to his new friends. He got into the seat next to me and say ""Hi, dad!"". I asked him how his day was and he told me with a smile that he really liked the school and his new classes and that his math teacher was really cool. he said he'd met some pretty nice kids and then asked if he could invite them over sometime next week to play video games after school. I was so happy! ""Of course you can!"" I said, ""just make sure you do your homework first."" I said and he hugged me, then we drove off home.

After being at the same job for 25 years, I worked my last day. I had thought long and hard about this decision. I enjoyed the people I worked with and I made a good living, but I was bored with my job. Plus, I would miss seeing the same friendly faces every day. But I wanted more out of life. I wanted to travel and spend more time with my family. I wanted time for myself. My company was having a big retirement party for me. They laid out a big spread of food and there was a delicious retirement cake. My company gave me a watch to thank me for my 25 years of service. On top of that, my boss gave me some new luggage that he said I could use with all the travelling I wanted to do. The biggest surprise of all, was that all the employees chipped in and paid for a trip to Italy for my husband and I. They were really sending me off in style! I could not believe it. After the retirement party, I went and finished packing up my office. I was more emotional than I thought I would be. My coworkers that I was closest to, came by to give some private good byes. I had special gifts for all of them. I knew we would stay in touch, but we would not be chatting everyday any longer. The time had come for me to leave my office for the last time. I had such mixed emotions as I walked out that door. Now, one week later, as I am packing for my trip to Italy, I know I made the right decision. There is so much more to life than working, and I am ready to get out there and live my life to the fullest!",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UG617H9,0.0

I am married with no kids and generated over 95% of the family income while employed. We live in LCOL rural TN. Our asset allocation is approximately 60% VTSAX (total US stock market) / 20% VFWAX (total INTL stock market) / 20% VWLUX (US municipal bonds). We also hold roughly $400k in house, land, and belongings not included in the portfolio. My spending model places no dependence upon possible future employment (outside pharmacy?), social security ($10k/yr?), inheritance ($500k?), house equity (reverse mortgage with no heirs?), universal health care (probable?), or universal basic income (possible?). The final balance will be left to charities and worthy causes. Two years later: A wild year for the market, but everything seems to be going as planned. We entered year two of early retirement at $1.146M on 6/1, peaked at $1.199M on 9/20, bottomed at $1.008M on 12/24, peaked again at $1.202M on 5/3, and finished back down at $1.138M. I think the concept of retiring early must include shaping a new, purposeful identity, whether that is in some kind of nonprofit work, traveling, writing, managing investments, etc. Peter Drucker talks about this concept in Managing Oneself, in that truly successful people work at their encore career/retirement plan and skills needed years before it happens. Our need to create and contribute doesn’t have to take the shape of work, but it doesn’t go away. And if we’re not purposeful about it then it becomes whatever we are already doing. I'd have an identity crisis if I was suddenly ""not a programmer"", but barring brain damage, nothing is going to make me ""not a programmer"", certainly not retiring. Financial security, even without the RE portion, will provide a permanent happiness boost for most people. It’s only after you leave your job do you truly realize how wound up you were in your profession.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UG617H9,0.0

The reason I say this is because at that time something happened that changed my outlook on life.  My husband and I were driving on a trip to Boston up north and almost got into a car crash. This was a turning point in our lives to be honest. I say this also because that alone changed my way of thinking on two fronts. The first thing that came to mind was how fragile our lives are and that was scary. Also how quickly things change, almost in the blink of an eye.  During that time it happened I was taken aback because I just kind of coasted. I nor him ever even thought about life without each other so that alone scared me. I looked at things differently after that day and so did he.  We started to focus more on the time we have here because having that happen was eye opening to us both. I almost cried as I watch the night end tonight as we go into the New Year because if things had gone different in that crash him or I could be alone. So in turn be thankful everyday you are alive because things can change that in a second. Also take in each day and cherish what you have and know that it can end just as quickly. Please also don't live in fear because life is short so love the time you have here. Lastly, the most important thing is while it's okay to be scared live life, but give yourself time to realize that you need to love and hold the ones you have everyday and thank the lord you have that time.",,38F5OAUN5OY4BJ1LMKRJMY8UJPH7HU,0.0

We had ice cream cake as desert, and we gave the dog whose name is Kane, his own little doggie ice cream. We all sang happy birthday to him. Afterwards we sat in the back yard around the fire and chit chatted about life. I ended up getting stuck with one of the girlfriends of our friend and had to pretend to have interest in the things she talked about for about an hour. We have nothing in common whatsoever, and I would rather have been talking to the guys. Either way, it was still a pretty good night. Even earlier in the night we had gone out to our favorite restaurant with friends as well so the whole day was really a full on enjoyment with friends time, and we enjoyed ourselves an awful lot. Kane was a good boy throughout the party and he had a lot of fun. He's a little bit of a big boy, though. When we went outside for the fire he had to stay inside.

Stop at the Steel Visitor Center for your first taste of rustic lodge architecture—look for the “snow tunnel”—and to watch the short but instructive film on the lake’s origins. en proceed to Rim Village, where you’ll see license plates representing just about every state and Canadian province and hear myriad languages. Here you can catch your first glimpse of the legendary blue water and stretch your legs on the Discovery Point Trail. Easy enough for families with young children, the 1.3-mile trail parallels Rim Drive, offering several tantalizing views of the lake with virtually no elevation gain. Want more? Continue on to the fire lookout at Watchman Peak, which, at 8,013 feet, is one of the highest points in the park. After the steep climb, enjoy the payoff: an unparalleled view of Wizard Island in its bowl of blue. You’re in for a treat, because you planned ahead—way ahead—and booked a room in the Crater Lake Lodge. Originally completed in 1915, this classic example of “Parkitecture” was almost lost. The building was failing under the heavy snow loads each winter, and it took a huge public outcry—and great expense—to prevent its razing. Though much of the lodge was re-built entirely, the design remains true to and even improves upon the original vision, with larger guest rooms and updated amenities. Step into a different century and enter the splendid dining room, with its unpeeled tree trunk columns, exposed wood ceilings, large windows and muscular stonework. Or, if the weather cooperates, sit on the veranda and sip Chardonnay while contemplating the view. e experience is made even lovelier with Northwest fare such as sweet corn fritters, field green salad with Oregonzola cheese, and balsamic-glazed lamb chops. If day one was all about the views, today is about getting up close and personal with an open-air boat tour of the lake. Pack a picnic and take East Rim Drive to the Cleetwood Cove Trail, which provides the only legal shore access in the park. If you’re brave, launch yourself off a short cliff once you reach the shore. Brace yourself: the water averages 55 degrees, even in August",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNIL32A6WU,0.0

Then during the movie his mom showed up. She sat in the row right behind us. This made us even more nervous than we already were. The movie we were watching was Toy Story Four. The movie was really good. We both enjoyed it. We did not do much talking once the movie started. I think this made things easier for us in the long run.

We went to see the movie Toy Story Four by ourselves. He is sixteen years old and I am fifteen. Anyway, we were both very excited because it was our first official date away from any adult supervision. We had just settled down in our seats with popcorn and a drink when the movie started. As soon as we started holding hands and the lights went low, we saw his mother watching us from across the theater! She wouldn't take her eyes off of us and it made the situation very awkward. We wanted to have some alone time where we could make out and enjoy the movie but his mom knew that we were planning this. She really doesn't like me and doesn't want me to take away her 'baby boy' from her. She wants to maintain his innocence. After she realized that we knew she was there, she came over and sat by us. The entire time she kept staring. We had to stop holding hands and both of us started sweating and became very nervous. Afterwards my boyfriend kept apologizing for his mother just showing up. Now we have to wait until we are both eighteen years old before we can go on a date again.",,3907X2AHF1RP2Z23ZLITZGTDJAJP2O,0.0

We ended up going out to dinner one night and started talking about everything in life. Though the conversation was just casual, I truly felt like the woman was amazing. She knew what she wanted in life and didn't seem like she would stray from her goals. She said that she didn't really want a serious relationship but I could tell as the conversation went on longer that she would be open to a long term relationship. Every time she would speak my heart would start beating harder and harder because everything about her was so attractive. As the night went on I finally asked her about her relationship goals. She let me know that she didn't really want anything long term but being that our evening was going so well, I might be changing her mind. I smiled and continue to talk to her throughout our dinner session. Once we left the restaurant we to a local bar to have a drink and that's when things really got good. She told me that just from spending some time with me that she wanted to be with me. She said she never felt that way after a few hours with someone. I told her that I felt the same way and that maybe we should pursue a relationship. She agreed and we've been together every since. We plan to get married in the next coming year.",,38YMOXR4MVL349I5Y98RHNILSP56WO,0.0

He was in kindergarten last year, and that was hard for me as well, as I had to come to terms with the fact that he was growing up and wasn't my little baby anymore. However, it was only kindergarten so he still felt like a ""baby' to me. This year however, he is noticeably older and more grown up. As he walked down the street towards the bus on his first day of first grade, he looked like a ""big kid"" instead of my little baby. It made me both happy and sad. As he is becoming such a wonderful young man, yet at the same time my little baby no longer is little (This is also evident as his clothes from last year are too small. Last year they were too big). Most surprisingly, he wasn't scared or nervous this year. At the start of kindergarten last year, he cried and begged me to stay home. I really wanted to keep him home as well! This year, didn't cry for me or try to run back home for another hug. I was glad he was feeling more independent, but part of me wished he needed me more. My little man is growing up so fast. I wish I could turn back the time and keep him my baby forever. Although I cannot, he will still always be ""mamas baby"".",,39DD6S19JQXBBJGPFEBWSF4GYJMEZS,0.0

It was a great trip. Everyone took off work early on Friday. The drive was supposed to be 8 hours but I put the pedal to the metal and made it in 6 and a half. The facilities at the dog park were top notch as well was the motel. Trixie won the most money betting on the dog races and Leeanna won big at the slots. Friday night everyone got really drunk and we had to carry Crystal up the stairs to the motel room that night. Saturday we bet on dog races all day and took a break at the motel pool with cocktails and snacks. Then we cleaned up and went to the all you can eat crab leg buffet. Then it was off to the gaming floor. A few in our group danced and watched the casino house band. Sunday we slept in late, took in the motel continental breakfast and hit the road for a relaxed drive back to West Cleveland.

She had wanted to go for over a year because she enjoys the experience of being able to ride roller coasters all day. She enjoys the rush of the speed you feel, the excitement of the loops and the thrill of dropping at high speeds. So this year, on her birthday, we were finally able to take her. We finally were able to take her this year a month ago. She said it was the best time she's ever had, because she got to go to her favorite amusement park and got to experience it with her family and friends on the same day. We rode many rides from sunup until sunset enjoying fun rides, crazy rides, and scary rides. At first she was a little timid because it has been almost two years since she last went on a roller coaster, but we made it work and she overcame the sacredness and persevered to be able to enjoy her day. One ride in particular that she says was definitely her most memorable time because of the sheer terror it puts into you, the height it goes to, and the countless amount of loops was on Superman The Ride. I liked this one also as it suspends you in a flying position throughout the ride. We enjoyed awesome snacks throughout the day and really bonded over this experience. She got to hang out with her two best friends and it was good for them to bond because with social activities and school it seems as if they never get the time to hang out and socialize with each other anymore. We went on a couple of water rides also, which they both liked and hated because it cooled us off but also because they had to walk around in wet clothing. We also rode the Batman just before dark and it was really enjoyable riding it as the sun was going down. All in all a great experience and a very Happy Birthday for my daughter.",,39GXDJN2OU0DTY1O1E0TFZVYZYKV8Y,0.0

I had never met the woman, but I've so many stories that I feel like I did.  This past July, her family and I flew out to the Big Island in Hawaii to spread the ashes.  The day came to spread the ashes and we made the picturesque drive across the Island to the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden.  I have never seen such breathtaking sights in my entire life: lush, verdant, practically alien-to-me plants everywhere; the most colorful flowers you can imagine; awe-inspiring waterfalls; and a medley of countless exotic birds all singing their enchanting island songs.  Once we arrived to the gardens and began the descent down the trail, it was even more sublime than the drive.  I truly felt like I was transported to another reality in which nothing existed but this sprawling, magical rain forest.  I was nervous that the day was going to be difficult for my girlfriend, her sister and all their children, but I approached it with a level of confidence in my abilities to comfort that I didn't even know existed.  We gathered at a stopping point and everyone said words that celebrated the life that had been lost.  The plan for everyone to find spots in the gardens that spoke to them and spread portions of the ashes.  The remains were divvied up and we resumed our journey downward. The atmosphere grew quiet and the birds almost seemed to sense this:  their songs had quieted into barely audible chirps.  Everyone's faces had a mixture of sorrow and happiness and I just maintained a stoic, yet positive look throughout.  The silence was interrupted by my girlfriend's oldest daughter who shrieked as she sprinkled some of the ashes, ""Ewwwww bones!""  My stomach sank for a moment, but everyone else chuckled a little bit and we moved on. The group slowly began to separate a little bit and my girlfriend led me down a path as she clutched my hand.  ""Find a place that you'd like to spread some,"" she said.  I panicked for a moment and said, ""I don't think that's appropri---.""  She cut me off with a firm shush.  ""She would have loved you.  Please do this for me,"" my girlfriend said as tears were welling up in her eyes.  I quickly, albeit a bit reluctantly, agreed. A few moments later we came to a majestic, spindly tree reaching higher than all the others around it.  A solitary bright beam of sunlight was gleaming through the canopy above and had illuminated an orchid.  The orchid was a beautiful mixture of purple fading into pink with little flecks of periwinkle on all the petals and it was swaying ever-so-slightly from a breeze; I knew this was the place. As I sprinkled the ash just underneath the orchid onto the moss-covered ground, the birds stopped singing entirely and I was enraptured by a tender, touching silence like I had never experienced in my life.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIGAD5AMD,0.0

Should I look in my wife's briefcase or not? She had left it on the kitchen table when she had to run out for a few minutes after getting back from work late. I wasn't even sure what I would be looking for. Broadly speaking, I was going to look for the truth. Just what was the truth — the reality — of our marriage? The situation was that our 17 year marriage was in serious trouble. During the last few years my wife had seemed out of sorts with me. To her, nothing I did was right. Our sex life had also dwindled away to nothing. My attempts to talk were met with lectures about how the only problem was me. I needed to understand that married life with young kids meant intimacy was not on the priory list. Kids as well as her career came first. I also needed to stop being overly sensitive about perceived slights from her when, according to her, there were none. I didn't know it at the time but she was totally gaslighting me. The last thing she wanted was an honest heart-to-heart talk. In the last few months the situation had gotten much worse. It turned out she had been having an affair with a good friend of mine for over two years. She swore how that one affair was all there was and that it was now over. We were going to start marriage counseling in a week. I had to push her to agree to go but at least she had finally acquiesced.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1K8MAX,0.0

It upset me because I had just had my hours cut a my job and was trying to get caught up on some bills. I really did not have the funds to buy a new tire. So I looked online at how much a new tire would cost and if I could maybe afford a used tire or find a place that would let me make payments. I found an affordable new tire, but they said I would have to pay the 100 dollars up front, and I just did not have it. The mechanic said that they had some used tires that were much cheaper, but I would have to come in and look at them to decide which one to buy. I thanked him and hung up. I then realized I had no way to get to the shop to buy the tire! I then called my good friend, Joe and told him about my situation. He said he would be glad to help and that he would be over in about twenty minutes. I was relieved that he could do it, because if he couldn't I would have to find another way to get there. Twenty minutes passed and he hadn't arrived yet, so I decided to wait a few more minutes before I started to wonder if he was really going to show or not. Right before I was going to call to see where he was at, he came driving down the street and pulled into my driveway. He got out of the car smiling and said ""Sorry, I can't drive you to the shop to buy a new tire..."" I looked at him and frowned and asked him ""Then why did you drive over here?"" we just smiled some more as he walked around to his trunk and opened it. ""Because I already bought you a new tire!"" I just stood there flabbergasted. I could have hugged him. That helped me out terribly. I thanked him profusely and told him I would pay him back when I could and he told me not to worry too much about it, just to remember that I owe him a favor. I am lucky to have such good friends.",,39K0FND3AI18MZ0UKKJGOUIG1JTMAG,0.0

We did not know the language, we had no friends, no money, just hope, determination, and the will to survive. My parents worked themselves to the bone to give me and my sister a better life. A life with opportunity, a life of choice and of freedom. In return, we worked hard for ourselves. We learned english, we made friends, we made good grades, and we stayed out of trouble. We owed that to them. When I received my first acceptance letter to college, my mother cried. I could see how proud she was. How this letter represented that all her sacrifice, all her hard work, that it was all paying off. When I went off to college, my father cried.

I haven't been on vacation in years, and my dad decided all four of us should take a vacation, and spend a few nights at the Down Stream Casino on the Oklahoma Missouri border. Being with my closest family member's meant the world to me. We started out at my apartment in Tulsa, OK and we drove about an hour and 15 minutes to our destination. When we first arrived I bought some Ice Cream at the casino's Ice Cream stand for my Son and I. After that we got the keys to our room, and brought all of our luggage there. We shared two rooms, and the rooms were extremely nice, and comfortable to relax and sleep in. I stayed in one room with my son, and my parents stayed in another. I didn't participate in much gambling, instead we watched Ellen DeGeneres Game show, and stayed up late watching TV and having good conversation with my son, and parents. After that we drove to a local restaurant, and had dinner together. Then my dad took me on a tour of the casino, bar, and slot machines. He showed me the machines he likes playing, I played with 20 dollars, and ended up cashing out 40, so I made a nice little profit.  I will always cherish this vacation with my close family member's that I don't always get to see. Their kindness and love will always radiate with me, and I will always remember them choosing to spend time with me, and make my day that much better. I will always remember this trip, and the fun times I had with my family. They will always be in my heart.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTPOXUI0,39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTPOXUI0,0.0

My PC is my life, I use it to work home and for my entertainment. Video games, music, watching movies, those kind of things are what I meant by entertainment. So you can understand just how important this computer is to me. Now when it comes to what I make, I'm usually well off enough that I can cover an emergency springing up out of nowhere. However around this time I believe funds were limited and I was just barely getting by with a few earnings saved here and there. So you can imagine how freaked out I was when I noticed my computer wouldn't boot. I had to test out my equipment at a friends house, which lead me to the conclusion that my CPU was causing the issue. At that time I thought I was screwed, I was using an older version of Intel's i5 CPU and they stopped selling those years ago. Buying used on E bay was a shot in the dark because the prices were high and you could never tell about the quality of the item until after you bought it. Lets just say I've had some bad experiences with E bay and used items. Anyway, just when I thought my luck was down and out some of my family members came to my rescue and loaned me the money I needed to purchase a new CPU. I don't recall if I mentioned this in the last diary entry I did about this subject, but not only was I able to afford a new CPU, they also gave me enough money to buy a new motherboard and ram as well. My old motherboard was using DDR3 ram while the new ones moved on to DDR4. They wanted me to buy a brand new CPU with a new motherboard and ram as well which was a huge surprise. I was so thankful to those family members that stepped in and helped me when they didn't have to. To this day I'm still very grateful for having such an amazing family. Also a little update on the story, since then I've paid them back fully for what they did. They didn't want to accept it at first, but I insisted that they had to accept my payback.",39LNWE0K4VI65PO15A2FW2NTGNSIU8,,0.0

I was  such an emotional wreck over their deaths that I went into auto pilot. I was dealing with funeral, insurance companies and estate issues and was just going through the motions. I signed so much paperwork it all looked the same. It was just a part of the process. My parents loved me dearly and spoiled me greatly. They always took care of me, even as an adult. Exactly 3 weeks after his death I started receiving settlement checks in the mail from a lawsuit he had just finished. It turns out that my father was awarded settlements from a lawsuit at the time of his death. As the executor of his estate the funds went to me. I was floored. The 12 checks were made out to me and had my father as reference. I immediately called the law firm and was explained that I had already signed the release and they had all that they needed. In  my autopilot state I signed all of the paperwork without even realizing it. And that was just the first round of checks.

We won the first two games easily without much trouble. Then we faced the toughest team in the city in the finals. Despite having a nice lead at half time, we struggled in the second half. The game came down to the final few minutes, where we led by a mere one point. In an effort to grab a rebound and give us a nice advantage, I was fouled extremely hard and came down badly on my knee. Right away I knew it was bad. I spent a few minutes writhing around in pain before being helped off the court. I was forced to sit on the bench and ice my knee while the final minutes ticked away. Unfortunately we did not have the size on our bench to replace my height, and it cost us the chance for the championship. The final score was 85-84, and we ended up leaving with a second place trophy. After the game I went to the hospital and they immediately told me I had ruptured a ligament, and would not be able to do much of anything for a while. Thankfully I had surgery quickly, but was unable to walk for a few weeks which was quite frustrating. My main goal however, is to get back to full health in time for next year's big tournament.

It was nice seeing my friend finally get married. She was really excited to see how her and her partner would continue life together in marriage. She wanted to own a home and have children. I remember going to the event I wasnt a participant but I did get to experience it with everyone involved. After the ceremony it was time for the reception. It was really enjoyable to interact with everyone, getting to dance and eat food. I had a ball dancing, we all did. I even met someone who I really liked there and we hit it off. When the event was over everyone gave their goodbyes. From there I spoke with my friend one last time and then I went home.",,39N5ACM9HF902JN2KUX8931RS1F9PV,0.0

My wife and I had decided to open up our relationship a little bit and experiment. So I downloaded Tinder, set up my profile, and began looking for a potential match. In the end, a woman who I'll call ""Claire"" matched with me and we began chatting. For around a month, we would text over the phone, trying to learn as much as possible about each other before we met up. Eventually, we decided to have our first date. I suggested a Thai place I really like and she agreed. It was a little awkward when we first saw each other but we quickly warmed to each other; I'd venture far enough to say that we hit it off. The first date lasted for hours, as we went for some frozen yogurt after dinner. She liked me enough to suggest that we go on another date. Date number two was at a place she suggested: a pub which featured board games to rent. She decided on Trivial Pursuit and we played a game. I feel like my behavior during the game might have turned her off, as she later said she thought we should be friends. However, that turned out to be a blessing in disguise as my wife and I decided dating other people wasn't for us and I got a good friend out of the deal. ""Claire"" and I have subsequently hung out many times and we continue to text almost daily.",,39OWYR0EPLD3C76GE3TJWQGE5KGYFB,0.0

This event was about how I had a company that refurbished old abandoned homes and fixed them up to sell them for a higher price. One of the big reasons that my company started to go under was the fact that a serial killer had started murdering people a couple miles from the house I bought. This caused the house to sit on the market for months until the police caught the guy and by that time it was to late and I had run out of money for my business. One of the most memorable experiences I had at the time was realizing I was really down to the wire. When I had to start selling things to pay for my mortgage and electricity that was a very scary time in my life. Another memorable experience and probably the hardest was selling the tools that I had used to fix up the houses. That part was significant because that is when I had really realized that this is over and I need to start planning for what was coming. Also to try and to avoid foreclosure and bankruptcy. I am less anxious and stressed now that I am living in a smaller apartment. I still wish that I would have realized that my business was failing and I should have sold my stuff more preemptively than when I had done so. I now take more ownership for my business going under. I should have had more money saved up than I did, and I do take ownership for my company failing even though it failed under such strange circumstances. Taking ownership is significant because it lets me be able to be around others when I am going through trying times instead of trying to push the blame on others. So people will be less nervous around me. I think now I do wish I could go back and fix the mistakes that I had made but the only thing we can do is push forward. I am still saving up money to try and redo the business now that I have more knowledge than before, but time will tell what happens with that.",39PAAFCODNMWRITC4CBO6VRLECMVT7,,0.0

The sun was shining, it was warm and there wasn't a cloud in the sky. This day would be a day that would forever change my life. I had worked hard for what was about to happen and I had sacrificed much of my family life to reach this goal. Today was the day that I would receive my Masters degree in Mechanical Engineering. This had been a goal since I graduated with my Bachelors degree almost 25 years earlier. Due to starting a family shortly after receiving my Bachelors degree, I had put off getting my Masters until my life had settled and I was financially capable of achieving this goal. Well, that time came 2 years ago when I took the step of enrolling in school at the age of 46. Did I need the Masters degree? Would it change my life? Would it allow me to make more money and be more successful? Well, yes I did need the degree and yes it would change my life. I mainly did it to keep a promise that I made to my parents when I had started my Family. It had been 25 years since I made that promise to them and now they wouldn't be here to witness it. So many emotions ran through my mind. Should I have done it earlier so that my parents could have been here? I knew that they were looking down upon me and this day and were just as proud as they would have been if they were here to see it with their own eyes. What made this even more special is that I would receive my Degree alongside of my Daughter who on the exact day, was receiving her Masters degree in Chemical Engineering. She has always been proud of here Dad but I know that she was more excited about my graduation than hers. When my name was called, I stood up, walked up onto that stage and broke down in tears. I don't know what caused the sudden surge of emotions but part of me felt my parents right there on the stage with me. I imagined my Mom crying and my Dad holding back tears of Joy. When I received my degree, I turned and faced my Wife and yelled: we did it!. She was overcome with emotion as well. My Daughter was next and I waited on stage for her. Upon receiving her degree, she ran to me and told me that she was proud of me.",39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MHEZMBK,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MHEZMBK,0.0

Remembering back to the day of this life changing event, I still remember and feel the sensations of that moment as it happened on that day. Memory has a way of staying vivid when something very powerful sets motion within your senses. Moments like this are never forgotten, as if the event took place recently, even though many years,perhaps decades have faded away. Time may fade away, but when you are responsible for changing the life of someone else for the better. Unlike time, this type of significance never fades away. To this day, I think about that moment when I helped that elderly man in the store, and what may have happened to him had I not been there, as if I was sent there by forces beyond my control to earn my role within humanity. I realize every day, that my life really did change from that moment, this which reflects the overall impact of my existence, and the value of it's meaning. I just hope that someday, when I am in a time of need, that some guardian angel may rescue me from whatever negative aspects which may abound me. If I had not been there in that store on that day, at that time, would this event be someone else's memory to reflect upon, or perhaps the opposite may hold true. These memories could have been dark and painful. For had this man died as a result of nobody there to save his life, this would have been an everlasting tragic event for others close to him. Funerals are hard to forget as well. Unfortunately, that is not the type of memory I want to hold onto. So, in the long run, I feel justified with an enriched focus upon my life focus. I truly feel as though I have earned significant credit toward my worthiness as a human being on this plane of existence.",39U1BHVTDMDCF9RTK25IN0Z2OFDT33,,0.0

I invited my friend out to the dock that we usually hang out. It took her a few days to even respond to the message and when we got out there I could tell that she was pretty uncomfortable. I tried just having a general conversation and I could tell that she was not going to bring up what happened. After fishing for about five minutes I decided to just get to the point and ask her why she did not want to be roommates. She tried to beat around the bust a bit but ended up telling me that she did not want to give up her privacy and freedom of living alone. This was kind of what I figured but when I said I already pointed this out when SHE was convincing ME to be her roommate she just ignored what I had to say. I just simply stated that this was not how friends should communicate to each other and that if something was on her mind then just tell me. After we got this out of the way I continued to fish and cast my pole. I caught a couple of smaller bait fish and then threw them out on my line. I let my friend just sit in silence as I was not making conversation and I could tell this made her uncomfortable. I decided to sit in silence until she broke it. This was a relaxing experience for me as I enjoy the silence and nature. I offered my friend a cigarette to break the ice and get conversation going again and I could tell she was relieved. We talked a bit more and then ended up leaving to go to our houses. I talked to my girlfriend about what happened and then decided to move on and forget the roommate situation all together.,39RP059MEIFD595MQYJCJ52MJ2QMBP,,0.0

My mother is getting up there in her age, she's 83 years old. Recently she had been having problems with her heart. It pumps very slowly and and she always has a very pale look to her face. Eventually the doctors say she needs to receive a pacemaker to help get her heart pumping again. The day of the surgery comes and the whole family is there talking with her and keeping her company before the surgery. She goes into the surgery and then next thing you know she's being taken to the ICU. The doctors said she had a sudden pulmonary edema and her lungs had filled up with fluid. She could barely get any oxygen. What was supposed to be a simple surgery turned into a life or death situation. We all waited by and were emotional wrecks, we thought she may not make it through the night. Luckily the doctors were able to stabilize her condition. She also had the pacemaker put in after she recovered. She ended up staying in the hospital about two weeks so the doctors could monitor her. My family and I were so happy she managed to survive.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTIF3YBM,0.0

She is 23 and was getting married to her high school sweetheart, so all around it was pretty fairytale as far as weddings go. The wedding took place at sunset on the shore of a lake in the Dallas/Fort Worth area and I had the privilege of walking my aunt, the brides mother, down the aisle. While I enjoyed spending time with my family I found it especially difficult to interact with anyone else in attendance. I can't say for sure why I struggle so much with events that are meant to be joyous, I only know that I have a difficult time allowing myself to feel happiness in conjunction with the happiness of others. For whatever reason, past sadnesses tend to bubble to the surface at these types of events. I think I've been to a few too many funerals. I was especially triggered by the father daughter dance, because the specific structure was inspired by the dance my sister and father did at her wedding. Neither my father or mother are alive anymore, so to relive that experience in a different setting was somewhat surreal and upsetting. I had to leave the venue to smoke a cigarette and collect myself. I know it's petty, but I kind of don't appreciate how my uncle co-opted this specific dance structure for both his daughter's weddings. I don't feel like he has proper ownership of it, and it's cheap and derivative. I don't like that I feel that bitter about something that is supposed to be joyous. I also can't help but be emotionally impacted to a large degree. I'm very happy for my cousin, and at the end of the day it was a learning experience for me. I was able to interact with a bunch of cousins who are younger than me and who i've always known as children. They're grown now and I have a good deal of pride about how their lives are progressing.

I have known her mother for almost 50 years. I knew that her mother had two daughters and I knew them both, but I was closest to her oldest daughter , Carolyn. Carolyn and I were two of the young people that travelled with my religious group to Chicago. We were always going to Chicago in those days, which was about a 10 hour drive. Carolyn was fifteen and I was nineteen. Her mother always travelled with us. Carolyn was a beauty even in those days but I could not flirt with her with her mother so close. I remember all the times we had to change a tire in those days, since we were always having flats on the drive. She would help me and thus, we could spend some time alone, away from her mother. I think she liked me too but it was too risky to date, since she was still underage. She got married at the age of 18 and I did not see her for many years, since her husband was in the military and they moved a lot. A few years ago, a friend died and I saw her again at the friend's funeral. She was still beautiful but she was also married, this time to her second husband. It was great to see her. Then, last week in my book club, we happened to mention some things and I found out that one of our new members was her ex-husband, who I had never met. We talked a bit about her mother and he told me that Carolyn had two children by him. He didn't mention she had recently died. I only found out about a week later. She was in her early 60s but she died peacefully in bed surrounded by family. She died young but she led a happy life.",3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR,3A0EX8ZRN9ADZQU0917ND0PTR9BYBR,0.0

I've actually had a heart attack previously. That was a full on STEMI with a complete blockage of my RCA and all the bells and whistles of a typical heart attack - basically a fireball in my chest. This time it was more of a slow crackling fire with a few spurts here and there. Anyways, I really wasn't sure it was a heart attack, but I got a little bag ready and call the ambulance. My blood pressure was 200-something over 108 in the ambulance and they said the EKG looked fine. At the hospital no one actually told me I had a heart attack. After about an hour or two sitting there I felt fine. A little winded, but otherwise no pain. They wanted me to stick around to MAYBE do a heart cath, but that would have been another two days in the hospital and as I said I was feeling fine. So I left. The nurse was a bit annoyed since this was against medical advice and she actually pulled my IV out the wrong way causing my hand to bleed heavier than normal which ticked me off. Otherwise no one came to tell me I had had a heart attack. I found out almost three weeks later when I checked my records online which showed a diagnosis NSTEMI. Needless to say I wish there was a different hospital that was closer.",3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRS73MLU,3A4NIXBJ77LPIIRYHB86X8YRS73MLU,0.0

It was a shock to the entire family because it happened so suddenly. I think about her constantly and I cannot believe that she is gone. I don't think there has been a single day that something has not reminded me of her. Sometimes when I am even in a store shopping, I see someone who looks similar to her and I am reminded of her. I recently had a birthday and even that brought back memories of her because I could always count on her sending me a card or acknowledging my birthday in some manner.  I am not sure how the family will be able to cope with the upcoming holidays. My aunt came to visit us every Christmas and I know that it will be hard on all of us, especially my mother. My mother and aunt were the closest sisters I have ever seen. They talked on the phone every day. Now, I make sure to call my mother every day in an attempt to fill the void. I am also planning to spend more time with her so that she doesn't get lonely. I also try to call my cousin more often to check on him. He lost his father last year and now his mother was taken so suddenly. We are all still coming to terms with the shock.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08JYYCHD,,0.0

It is so hard to let go of a dog that you love with all your heart. Petey was exceptional as a pet. He was my best friend for so many years. Daily I see reminders of him in my house, on the internet and when I am out and about. I pass an exit where I used to get his medicine, and his image comes to my mind. I see his picture on the pillow in my bedroom, and I try to imagine what it felt like to touch his fur and scratch his belly. Although he died more than 4 months ago, to me it feels like it happened yesterday. The hardest part for me has been to realize that I will never see my Petey Pea again. I would give up so much just to hold him one more time or be able to spend one more day with him. Since Petey's passing I have adopted another dog. Although I wanted another Chihuahua, I realized that getting the same breed would make comparisons to Petey almost impossible not to do. Instead I got a female JackChi. She has helped fill the hole in my heart that Petey left. I am bonding with her and realize that she is what I needed. She was a rescue dog, and I believe that she needed me too.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08K0IHC7,,0.0

The area is becoming more and more inundated by homeless people. My friend was excited to show me the office as we parked in the building's driveway and did a brief tour just after sunset. As we were backing out of the driveway, we observed a homeless man sitting on the front porch of my friend's office and he was eating a sandwich, tossing his wrappers all over the porch. My friend was annoyed, rolled down his car window and hollered to the homeless man, ""Please pick up your trash when you're through, buddy."" As we proceeded to back out of the driveway, the homeless man jumped up and ran after us. He approached my friend's driver-side window which was still partially lowered, as if to start a conversation. The homeless man threw a handful of rocks right at my friend's head. Just as my friend pulled back, the rocks flew across the front seat of the car and struck me on the knee and hand. The sharp edges cut my skin and I was bleeding some. I yelled at my friend, ""Just get out of here!"" As my friend backed hurriedly out of the driveway, we looked in the rear view mirror and the homeless man was still running down the street, chasing us, throwing rocks at our car! When we reached a red stoplight, the man caught up to us. My friend lowered his window again, enough to take a photo of the man. I was angry at my friend for lowering the window for any reason, and again hollered, ""Just get out of here!"" I was so horrified by the event that I swore I would never to to my friend's office again. My friend continued to do business at his new location, but now, he always carries a weapon.

Now I have been out the country before but it was just to Europe and Canada so I wasnt quite sure what to expect. After the long thirty hours it took to get to my destination I get to customs and when I show them my passport I was told to sit down where nobody tells me a thing for an entire hour. At this point im terrified since this is my first time traveling internationally by myself and there are a bunch of people with automatic rifles who told me to sit down. The entire hour im picturing how im going to spend the rest of my life in a Vietnamese prison but eventually I find out that the consulate in San Francisco screwed something up and I was free to enter the country. So I walk down grab my bags and exchange some money for the taxi ride. For months I had been researching Vietnam and all the scams that happen so I knew one of the big ones was that you always take a taxi with a meter. As I walk out of the airport some guy comes up to me and asks if I need a taxi. I say yes and we walk to his car. He tells me $40 and I say meter but he says he doesnt have one. We go back and fourth for a while and eventually I accept since that price sounds reasonable, its 3 AM and I havent slept in over a day. So we drive to my hotel and everything is fine. Eventually I come to find pretty much every taxi is about one dollar anywhere in the city. Months of panning to not get ripped off gone out the window 30 seconds into my trip. The next day I wake up early and walk out of my hotel and see im pretty much next to the biggest market in Ho Chi Minh City so there are people trying to sell you everything. Once again 5 steps out of the hotel some guy trys to sell me on some tour which I read is a ripoff. Also the motorbikes are deathtraps so I wasnt interested. I tell this guy no 20 times but he continues to walk with me. Then he starts showing me pictures of him with only white people and their handwritten notes that talk about how amazing he is. Obviously a scam as I continue to walk to the market but he wont leave. During the walk some little five year old girl walk up to me and starts holding my hand which scares me more than anything. I try to shake my hand to get her to let go but she refuses. Eventually the man gets her to let go so at least now im happy he is there. I finally make it to the market so the man leaves.  Overall it was a difficult beginning to Vietnam but I love the country and the people who live there and it ended up being on of the best travel experiences of my life.",3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD,3A4TN5196L4AN0WHD1ZU2K08IB4HCD,0.0

My house is already sold and we are currently staying with my grandmother who is also leaving vegas from all of the emotional deaths in the family. Her house is currently on the market and we have to be out of here by nov 3rd. Our new home is ready for us when we get there. its very nice and im pleased with the outcome. it even has solar panel hook ups. We have just about wrapped up everything we need to wrap up. Some of the last things we have to do is go to some doctor follow up appointments and see if we can get some type of recommendations for doctors in California. Then just for good measure i went and got an extension on my medications for 60 days. It took a little effort but they were sympathetic. I spent last night drinking beer with my brother and reminiscing about our mother. We had a good time i drink way to much than i should have but it was worse it.  Then later that night when i was laying in bed I got a phone call  from my other (he took my moms dog)  brother who told me that my moms dog died that night. i took it hard because it was my moms dog and i felt like it was kinda like the last part of her is gone.,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z01G6OP,,0.0

I had a DNA test done and one of my mother's sibling come as as only being half related to me. I then discovered that my grandmother had relations with someone else. I was not expecting this at all. My grandmother never alluded to such a thing. I doubt she even knew for sure that my mom was not my thought-to-be grandfather's. He died when my mother was about 5. My mother knew of a man that she saw around her house when she was young that my grandmother had relations with. It was from that provided identity that I explored the tree's of some of my closest DNA connections. I found the same surname of the man in a few of their trees. This lead to me figure that he must be my grandfather. I connected with one of my closest DNA relatives to ask some questions. He also did not know who his grandfather is, and we suspect that his grandfather is my mother's father. His father discovered that his father was no who he always though it was after he took one. The man we believe we are both related to died in 1993 and had no children with any of his wives, so there really isn't anyone to test against to receive an answer of absolute certainty. I am pretty sure the man my mom identified is my grandfather as well as his. We are currently working on figuring this out. He is genetically my half cousin I believe. That is my best guess from the amount of DNA we share. I am trying to help the other guy confirm who his grandfather is. I think it is the same as mine, but he thinks it could be him or his brother.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WBEQ5PN0,0.0

I haven't been able to sleep since. My father was a very healthy man. He did things like eat healthy, exercise weekly, and went for regular routine check ups with his doctor. If I told me before he died that he wouldn't die of ""old age"" I wouldn't have believed you. My father was kind, caring, and very instrumental to my upbringing. I know that tomorrow is never promised to any of us and at any moment a ""freak accident"" could happen and just like that any of us could be gone. Up until now because it personally never happened to me I didn't really believe it could happen to me. My father was on a run around his surrounding neighborhood like he normally does every week. Unfortunately what my father didn't know was that on this particular day there was a robbery that took place in one of the boarding neighborhoods that he runs through. My father vaguely fit the description of the man who robbed the neighbor so police mistook my father for the robber. The police apparently gave my father instructions to stop running and show his hand but my father had a hoodie on and under the hoodie he had in headphones so he did not hear the polices orders. He eventually saw one of the neighbors motioning towards him to turn around so my father did. My father had his cell phone in his hand and the police claimed they thought it was a gun so they shot my father and he died at the scene. Eventually the police realized they had the wrong man but the damage was already done. Now I fear the police and even going outside my home. The police department has apologized but their apology will not bring back my father. I'm filled with emptiness, anger, and hurt so I lay awake every night since then because when I sleep I relive that day over again.",,3AMW0RGHOEOLRLRWL4GDR4WB5WVNPR,0.0

I realized that I soon had to catch the bus, so i stopped and waited at the bus stop. At the bus stop, i met a man named Casey. Casey was a young homeless man. After talking to him, I had great pity on him. Casey lost everything in the financial crisis, and he had no family left. After talking to him for a while, I realized I had to do something. I offered Casey money, but he would not take any. I decided I should invite him back to my place. I live alone after all. I told Casey he could sleep on my couch that night if he would like to. Casey came back to my house, ad we watched Netflix for a good while. As he shared more about his story, I felt my entire life perspective change. I realized that i took so many things for granted.

I had just turned 25 and it was the 4th of July. My family and I went to Montauk state park for the weekend. We rented a big camper and filled it with everything we needed. We took the long drive out to Montauk together. We even brought our dog. We parked the RV at our campsite and spent the next 2 days totally disconnected from life. No one was allowed to use their cell phone. Everyone just sat around talking. It was amazing. We cooked every meal on the grill. We swam in the ocean all day. I wish I could live there for the rest of my life. I honestly think that was the most fun I had ever had. I was shocked to feel that way about time with my family. I was devastated to come back to regular life. I didn't even look forward to using my cell phone!,,3AQF3RZ55941TNWA8KYRDZWLZ1RF67,0.0

After spending the past 4 months with my mother since my Proximal Afib diagnosis making me unable to work. I woke up one day to find out that my mother suddenly collapsed at work and died. My grandmother came to our house and told me that she died. I remember immediately going historical and walking into my bedroom to punch my pillows with all my might screaming no no no no. After a few moments in intense sadness i started to ask questions i was told we had to go to her work to pick up her belongings. So we went to her work and i picked up her purse and her lunch bag. I was crying the whole time and could barely compose my self. Everyone was very understanding and they told me that my mother was a good friend of theirs and they will really miss her. After that i went home and i didn't know what to do i didn't sleep for 3 days and the stress made my proximal afib start up and i my heart raced for hours and i kept having constant PVCs (premature ventricular contractions) about every 10 minutes. because of this i had to go to the ER. I was admitted for 2 days while they watched my hear rate and gave me some types of medications. They made me take a nuclear stress test to see if my heart was damaged, luckily it was not. and i was released later that evening with a prescript for a FDA black label drug called Tambocor to control my hear rate. Its been a few months since then and my grandmother let me live in my mothers house for the time being but that has not lasted very long because my Great aunt died 2 months after my mother from lung cancer. This broke my grandmother. My grandfather died 2 years prior then my mother then her sister. She started having intense crying spells and acting very irrational. So me and my Disabled brother who is on SSI went to stay with her to keep her company. While we were staying with her She constantly verbally abused us. One day she broke down and had to go to the ER for Angina. She told them t hat she wanted to kill her self and was put in the psych ward. My moms sister came down to save her and took her to lie with her. Yesterday i was told that my grandmother was no longer able to think rationally and that my mothers house and grandmothers house was to be sold. I was given until the end of October to get my medical affairs in order and leave the house im currently in.",3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z01G6OP,3AMYWKA6YC8VZ0937NHH0T5Z01G6OP,0.0

That was a mistake. I was drinking more then usual since I didn't really know any of her friends that were out with us and I was kind of nervous. By the time we made it to the third or fourth bar I was hammered. So looking back I think she planted a fingernail in my drink as a joke. I was so drunk I thought the bartender had planted it. Why, who knows. So I made a huge scene about it in the bar. She was trying to stop me and calm me down but I was so disgusted I didn't want too. The bartender got really offended and we got in too it. Told me I'd had enough and to leave. Luckily my sister was able to convince him that we could stay and I didn't ruin her party.

What about my daughters' first menstrual cycles? And what about my son? Will he have momma issues? Will he struggle with romantic relationships? I no longer felt so victorious. Instead, I felt unqualified and overwhelmed. Then something major happened: my ex-wife's boyfriend went to jail and is facing a huge prison sentence. Since his incarceration, my ex-wife and I get along wonderfully. We're talking and even hanging out a bit. I drop the kids off and everyone is happy. The ex-wife expresses some regrets. Maybe she's just crushed under the load of child support. Does she deserve a second chance? Will we get back together? Should I forgive her? Am I a fool? Only time will tell.",3AWETUDC93ENROIBBX1NDU28STYIZA,,0.0

I have been reflecting a lot on the day he was born recently. As expected, my life has changed almost completely. It's all been for the better of course but it's made me think about things and look at them with new eyes. My priorities in life have changed and I have spent many nights thinking about my relationship with my own parents and family. I want to change so many things and be the best I can be for my son. My family ties haven't been strong since I became an adult and my son has made me realize it's time to change that because before I know it my parents will be gone and he will be a grown man with his own children. I want to be the kind of parent that instills family values. I want him to know and be close with his grandparents, aunts and uncles, cousins, and all extended family. I want to be the kind of parent he comes home to see every thanksgiving and Christmas. I want him to know I tried and became the best person I could be all for him. I'm working on it and I won't stop! I'm enjoying every moment and trying to live in that moment. He's crawling and babbling and eating real food and I'm basking in it as long as possible as I know it won't last forever. We are going to see my parents next weekend and I can't wait to start this tradition of being together and having regular family get togethers.

I drew immense pleasure when the marriage ceremony of my cousin was held. It was performed on 23rd of the last month. There was a great excitement and joy among us to see the preparations for the wedding celebration in our family. Decorations were made on the day before the marriage ceremony. A shrine was prepared for the celebration. It was also decorated with paper flowers. The canopy above the shrine was made of colored cloths. Another big canopy was put up in the open ground in front of our house. An electrician with his four assistants decorated the closed space with a number of multi-colored electric lamps. My father and uncle stood at the gate to receive the guests. The marriage party arrived at-seven in the evening. First, the guests were served sweets and cold drinks. Many guests had brought different gifts for my cousin who was the bride. The marriage party members were very gentle. The groom was seated on a palanquin with thick garlands around his neck. The marriage ceremony was held after the reception. Many senior members including my parents and the parents of the groom were present at the time of the holy marriage on the shrine. The bride and the groom exchanged garlands and sacredly accepted each other as the partner of life.

I went on a walking tour and say many of the park's geysers and also many wild animals. I also went fly fishing for the first time in my life and caught some fish while there. My vacation was very memorable and I had several experiences that I will carry with me for a long time.  I went with two other of my friends from my university and we camped in tents at a nice campground while we were there. The most memorable moment of the trip was whenever I caught my first fish while fly fishing. I didn't expect to catch anything because I didn't think I was doing it right and I haven't had much luck in my past with regular fishing. To my surprise, on my fifth cast, the line was pulled hard and I quickly jerked back and reeled in a 4 lb trout! Since I've been so busy with college over the past many years, it's been a long time since I've had the chance to take a vacation and enjoy nature. My major in school is environmental science and I always thought it was silly that I was studying the environment but hadn't actually been in a natural environment in 10+ years. This was a much needed vacation. My friends and I cooked our fish that we caught for supper every night over a campfire. In the mornings we would tour the park in search of rare geysers that were about to go off. Those were fun to watch but I enjoyed seeing the beautiful multi-colored pools of hot water that scattered the landscape. It was also very neat to learn about the ancient people that used to live in the area and their religious significance that they placed on the land. I enjoyed writing this journal entry and would like to participate in the second part of the study as well.",,3AZHRG4CU56BZ0U2M0H83PXX11230R,0.0

My wife is due is the next 8 weeks and I am excited, anxious and everything in between. My wife and I were actually going to work on starting a family next year, however, it seems as though the universe had other plans. I was not sure at first how to feel about it but when I heard the baby's heartbeat for the first time, we were emotionally overwhelmed with joy. Hearing the heartbeat and seeing that little flicker of light on the screen was like staring at a star in space. It was a whole new experience for me as a person and seemed to remind me of the divine forces that work in our life sometimes. This new experience in my life also triggered so many other emotions, particularly the relationship with my family. My relationship with my family has been a roller coaster throughout my life and one of the most negative aspects in my life. The addition of a new baby seems to have bright some much needed positivity within my family but there is still some hesitation on my part to embrace my family. However, I do want my child to know their family and recognize how important that is. I have to remind myself that I need not project the failures of my parents on to my child and understand that those failures do not determine the quality of parent I am looking to be. My approach and mentality will be different. The situation my child will be born in to is already better than the one I was born in to. The changing of my priorities is scary but this is now my path. My baby's life is now at the forefront of my thinking and I must do everything in my power to ensure the life of this child can excel and prosper. This is my new normal and I look forward to learning many new things about myself and the world.",,3B1NLC6UG0IFHTAAY03I1KNE4J8GP9,0.0

I was the only xray tech/ct tech working that shift and it was pretty slow.  Being 8 months pregnant with my first child, I got tired very easily. As I was sitting at my desk, nodding off from boredom, I felt my hospital pager buzz in my pocket.  I was instructed to call the emergency room where they informed me that we had a 'John Doe' coming in and  that they would be wheeling him directly to cat scan from the ambulance.  I ran - more like wobbled - to the cat scan room and prepared for the unidentified man to come in. My heart was beating a bit faster, was it from the run down here or the anticipation of the trauma? The EMS team arrived with the emergency room lead doctor following behind. On the count of three, we pulled Mr. John Doe over to the CT table and I could start my exam. Code stroke - a passerby found him unresponsive for who knows how long. I looked down to exam my patient and I'm sure at that moment my face went white.  My throat instantly felt like there was a ball in it and I wanted to freeze, hug him, and cry. This was life threatening and I needed to move on quickly. ""I know who your John Doe is"" I said to the emergency team. It was a friend of mine, a very close man that I looked up to throughout my life. He was a father of 3, he was an ""uncle al"" to my stepson, he was maple syrup enthusiast, a member of our church, he was a ball player on my husband's baseball team; He was not just a john doe, he was our Al. After 3 days of life-supporting machinery with weeping family members at his bedside, uncle Al passed away. Every morning during that 3 days towards the end of my shift, I would be required to take a bedside chest xray to track his progression. During that time I would reminisce on our memories together. We still don't have answers to why he had a heart attack in the first place. His heart malfunctioned, and then his organs followed behind and shut down as well. At only 46 years old it was a shock to us all. I like to think he had another, more important, place to be.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950T136BP,0.0

It was about a ten hour long car ride. My boyfriend and I are huge fans of road trips so a ten hour car ride is not that bad, or so we thought. His sister and her boyfriend seems like okay people to travel with, they were family so I was like why not. The first few hours were not to bad they were a little loud, almost like having children in the backseat. Then a couple more hours in to the trip their true colors started to show. They started to argue almost every second, which made the trip pretty miserable. They are also huge chain smokers so the ten hour trip gained a few hours due to the frequent stops and long stops for them to smoke their cigarettes. At every stop it would take them about thirty minutes to do their business. In the car it would just be moments of silence followed by yelling followed by making out. It was one of the most uncomfortable trips ever. At the wedding they got into more fights which only made the trip back home even worse. There was more fighting more yelling and due to their stress over arguing we needed to make more stops so that they could smoke even more. It was so uncomfortable, I could not even look to the back of the car because I did not want to see them either arguing with each other or making out. By the end of it I wanted to jump out of the car. Who knew that people in their twenty's could still act like teenagers.",3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,,0.0

My only wish was to be happy at when I get there and have a memorable birthday,when I got to the airport I took an uber to take me to the house. Soon I arrived home, I looked around with no idea of where every one was .the front door was open . I didn't like it. I became anxious and worried. I went upstairs and I met my sisters son . she said they all stepped out so we familiarized and I enjoyed her company because she was very funny. I felt like an her playmate for years. I sat down and closed my eyes. I remembered my old school, my old friends, my teachers and we all played when I was much younger like her. Suddenly my sister her mom walked up to me and screamed happy birthday and at that moment every one came out of their hiding position and I was shocked because I never expected such surprise. It was the best birthday ever and I wish to have such birthday again soonest. Everyone presented lots of gift to me and i was so happy and perplexed on what to say because i was confounded with the best words to use and explain my feelings.",,3B2X28YI3X1BG6KU3ICVU950JPX6BL,0.0

We had planned this week long vacation for several months in advance. It had been arranged so that we could visit relatives who live in the area. The morning we were to leave for our trip was very sunny so I woke up a few hours early from the light shining through my window. So, I used this extra time to finish packing my belongings that I had forgotten to pack the night before. We left around 9:30 on a warm, July Monday morning. It was a long trip and when we finally got there we were exhausted. So we decided to just rest and start out early the following morning. After that we went to Ride Niagara, a simulated ride over the Niagara Falls. It was rather realistic considering we never moved from a set position. After the ride, we met a French Canadian, who had a heavy accent and lived in Quebec. He helped us decide what attractions were worthwhile. After visiting a few of them we returned to the hotel worn out. On that Wednesday we rode on the Maid Of The Mist. When the boat reached close to the bottom of the falls everyone could feel the power of the falls by the incredible mist and loud roar of the falls. Later that day we went on a journey behind the falls, which took us through tunnels that actually opened up behind the falls. The lines for both these activities were very long so this took up most of the day. We spent another day visiting tourist attractions in that area. Then we decided to spend the rest of our time visiting our relatives. We saw many of our family members we haven? t seen in years. It was sad that we had to leave that Sunday, but we did. So we left for a long ride home with only the memories of our vacation.",3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYEJI29D,,0.0

As a result, we decided to talk things out. She wasn't mad. I wasn't mad. We were both very passionate about our positions on the matter. As we talked it out, she told me that his personal experiences shaped her side of view. This was irony at its finest. My point of view was shaped by my personal experiences.

I grew up in China but moved to the United States 10 years ago and this was my 3rd time back there since I moved with my child. I haven't seen my mom in 3 years nor my sister, and they are very important people in my life so it was hard to not see them for so long. Only my sister, child, boyfriend, and other family members went to Beijing though so my mom wasn't able to come along due to her health and age which was sad. It was memorable to go to Beijing though because we had a tour guide and our first stop was Tiananmen Square and it was incredible to see it in real life as I always saw it in movies or TV shows that I have watched. There were so many people there but I had a good time walking around, seeing the Forbidden City behind it as well. Our tour guide did a good job of explaining the history behind the Forbidden City and it was interesting to learn about everything. There were clocks donated by other countries displayed and that was one of my favorite things to see. The day after we went to Tiananmen Square again getting up at 3 am in the morning to see the flag rise and soldiers to walk out. There were surprisingly a lot of people there at that time too, with everyone trying to take a video of it. We also went to the museum and various palaces the same day. The day after that, we were able to go to the Great Wall of China which was a once in a lifetime experience. We took a cable car up to the Great Wall and we didn't walk too much, we just mainly admired the scenery and the beauty of it all. The history behind the Great Wall is fascinating and I can't imagine how many people poured their life into building the Wall. Overall, my trip to Beijing was the most memorable trip that I have had and a truly touching experience.",,3B3WTRP3DCO4ACMWIWMWDQTYN7R92E,0.0

She loved the hanna barbara characters as well as the dc superheros which was my personal favorite. The roller coasters were amazing batman the ride and goliath were two of the girls favorite. While my wife enjoyed the shops with t shirts and the cafes were super amazing. The food was great and at somewhat reasonable prices. The weather was spot on not to cold not to hot in the mid 70's and sunny. I really enjoyed seeing the girls interact with the people and other kids. We went to the water park as well were dc characters swam with the kids.  The prices for the tickets werent bad at all. I really enjoyed my time at the park. I would go again at anytime. It was one of our most memorable trips we have had. I have som many memories from our trip. The smiles on the kids faces.

Myself and my wife and kids flew out there to visit some family and we decided to visit the amusement park as a little perk while we were in the area. First off the scenery in California and especially that area is beautiful. The mountains the beaches its just the best. So I have two daughters 12 and 15 at the time and their phones are usually the only thing they respond to, but on this trip we took on every roller coaster out there. The batman and superman rides were so fast and high speeds at breakneck speeds. The hall of justice which is an interactive 3d simulation of the justice league was amazing. The hills of the park if you are walking were really steep and my wife once said Damn are we walking to Everest lol. So we finally hit our destination...Goliath a huge roller coaster the biggest in the park. My youngest daughter who previously had rode everyone of the coaster comes up beside me and says Daddy NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT in her hip hop voice lol which was one of the funniest things on the trip. So she finally decided to give it a whirl and she enjoyed it. All and all I would have to say its one of the best trips we have been on as a family. I really enjoyed myself and I think my wife and kids did to. So if anyone is ever in that area to see six flags magic mountain. I suggest you see it. Its really an awesome experience for the young and old",3B4YI393VAIFKQZTLH1TL3BSCW8SSH,3B4YI393VAIFKQZTLH1TL3BSCW8SSH,0.0

I haven't talked to her in over 5 years now.  I was so excited to finally tell her that we had a baby boy and that she was a grandma.  She sounded so happy for us.  We got to talking about what has happened these past five years.  I told her about getting married and my wife getting pregnant.  How we moved to a different state and how we had our first son.  She had been embarrassed to return my many calls.  She had quit drinking 10 years ago but she hit some hard times and started up again.  It got so bad for her that she had to go to rehab to quit.  I had a bit of a rocky upbringing because of her problems and she didn't want to burden me with them again.

Some I had never met, they were kids. It was very stressful dealing with my mom and my grandma at once. They're difficult personalities. I liked getting back in touch with cousins for the most part. One seemed to be avoiding us for some reason and I don't think it was ever sorted out. I'd been caring for my mom alone for the previous year and it took everything out of me.

They made the incision in the side of my neck and placed the necessary hardware to fuse together three vertebrae.  While recovering from the surgery the next day something happened (I believe that a mistake was made and I was overdosed with medication) and I developed weakness on my right side.  I was treated in the hospital for the sypmptoms and after four days and transferred to a rehab hospital to regain strength and stability.  While in the rehab facility I developed a staph infection in the surgical incision which progressed into my blood stream and turned septic.  This infection made me incredibly weak and delirious.  I was transferred back to the hospital where my surgery was done and a second surgery was performed to clean the infection out of the incision and area of the surgery.  I was placed on an antibiotic IV drip and transferred back to the rehab center.  I was in the rehab center for another 3 weeks while recovering, and was finally released to go home.  I still am recovering from the residual effects of the incident, and have pain and weakness in my leg.  I think about the incident every time I stand up and feel the instablilty and pain in my leg.  I have continued to see specialists for the infection and cervical surgery.  I am told that I will be on antibiotics for at least a year.  The spinal surgeon said that he has no idea why the infection developed,  He says the reason I will have to  remain on the antibiotics is that the infection could have contacted the hardware used to fuse my vertebrae.  All in all I wish I had never had the surgery, and just lived with the pain.",3BGYGHDBBY6TAS1XXN7H33LKJQB22P,3BGYGHDBBY6TAS1XXN7H33LKJQB22P,0.0

We were finally at a stage in our lives, after working very hard for it to where we could and did just bought a new home less than a year ago that was a nice size and could fit my husband, me, our 3 kids and our dog very comfortably.  My husband had a really good job and we were able to live comfortably.  That all changed when another company took over the company my husband was working for. They came in and did a complete take-over. My husband's new boss decided he didn't like him and he wasn't cut out to be their type of 'material' even though my husband is the best in his field.  Without warning, my husband's new boss was waiting for him when he got to work the other morning.  Along with 4 armed police officers.  He fired my husband right then and there and couldn't even give him a reason why he was firing him.  He couldn't because my husband did nothing wrong at all. The police officers 'escorted' my husband back out to his truck.  He was humiliated and upset and furious.  So here we are now. We had to sell our new house and move into a 1000 square foot rental that doesn't even begin to fit all of us.  My piddly job barely brings in enough to put food on the table to feed all of us. My husband has tried and tried to get another job, but nobody seems to want to interview him probably due to his age.  I am just so upset about everything. I have so much worry (about how we're going to take care of our kids), anger and hatred for what that person did to him, and sadness over the entire thing.  It's taking a toll on my health, mentally and physically.  No one should have to go through this. If he had done something wrong, then yes, I could understand this happening, but he didn't.  We've sought an attorney, but they said what they did was not illegal, completely wrong and immoral, but not illegal, so there is nothing we can do.  I'm just sick!!!",,3BQU611VFQ6FAW7V351BND1CKUA994,0.0

Improv was always something I felt passionate about from a young age and wanted to be involved in but geographically there was no group or avenue to show that. Now, in a new city with new people, I was able to build relationships in the improve community and then merge that with the stand-up comedy group that consists of some of the greatest comedic minds and friends I’ve met to date. I started writing my own stand-up shortly after getting involved with the standup group and after a few months of writing, I performed my first set at a brewery in front of about 30-40 strangers. The event was set up as a pretty structured open mic night that I’d signed up for earlier in the week. There were 13 other comedians performing that night, with varying levels of experience but all more seasoned than I would have considered myself to be. The host of the night announced before the first comic went on that tonight would be arranged a little differently. Tonight there would be a cash prize for the audience’s favorite comic. This definitely made me feel more nervous as I felt like all the other comics would really up their game. I was shaky and unsure of myself but when the host called my name to go on, my worry washed away. I simply stood up and performed what I’d written and worked so hard on presenting. I believed in what I did and I was proud no matter the outcome. I even did some crowdwork and I made the audience laugh on several occasions. After the performance was over, the audience clapped and cheered as the host held his hand over each individual comedian, signaling how much they liked each person’s material and presentation. When his hand got to me, the cheering and yelling seemed to blast so loudly that this sensational wave of adrenaline and excitement went over me. I hadn’t expected to win or even to do really well, but just to pursue something I’d wanted to do for a long time and I wanted to share my material that I believed in. I was awarded the cash prize and several other comics and audience members approached me after the show and asked me to be on their podcasts, perform at other shows/spaces, and what my writing process was. I was so honored and the feeling of adrenaline kept me up almost all night long. I still have the cash I won from that night in a box in my room at home as it serves as a reminder not only of what I won, but what I gained as a person that night in esteem, in hope, and in faith that I can be me again.",3BF51CHDTWWQT8111L6A7JY79MEH0R,,0.0

I wasn't expecting it at all. I had been talking with a friend of a friend about her small business. She has an employee turn in her notice. She wanted to talk to me to see if I might be interested in the position. After we met, I asked her what she wanted the next steps to be. She got very vague, and talked about how they needed to let the other girl leave, and really take a look at their work load and see figure out what they needed in this new person. I thought that would be the end of it, I thought she didn't know what she wanted to do, and didn't know if I was a part of that at all. Then she circled back with me in about a week, and said we should talk more about her company. I went over to her house after work one day, and we sat on the front porch and chatted. She explained they needed someone who could start out doing operations and learning the business, then in 6 months they could add in marketing and a bump in title and pay. Eventually, she wants this person to be the COO so she can retire. Then she said she could bring me in at my current salary, and would I be interested?

There was heavy traffic, and I had looked down to change the song playing on my phone when I rear ended the car in front of me due to not noticing they had stopped. Unfortunately this caused my car's front in to be pushed in, totaling my car due to the damage. My car was the only one left damaged, the other person's car only ended up with minor damage and scratches that were barely noticeable. Thankfully, nobody was injured but it has been hard for me to work since then because my job required me using my car to travel and I no longer have a car at the moment. Being a single mother with no help taking care of my daughter, I was devastated because the jobs I used my car to do were one of the few jobs I was able to do that I could work around my daughter's school schedule so that I could be home when she got out of school, since I had nobody to watch her for me. I also made just enough to pay bills with a little extras spending money, and I could not afford to pay for childcare for her to work more hours. I now have to work from home to save up to buy another car, which is significantly less than what I was earning before. I know I am at fault and I beat myself every day about not paying attention. I feel like I must work double just to be able to make what I was making before so I can buy another car and it still is not enough, what with having to also come up with money to take a taxi when I need to go to the store or run errands. I feel like in doing that it takes away from what I could be saving for another car or to pay bills. While I hate that this happened I do think it's a life lesson. I realize that I need to be mindful and pay more attention. I also believe it's just another obstacle to make me work harder.

It was the first event we held in our home since moving in, a month prior to the party. It was a big deal, because we were about to move in last fall before Hurricane Florence hit, flooding our newly built home. We had almost 4 feet of water in our home. It was a party, and just a celebration as well, to finally complete the home (again). We had not even gotten 100% settled before the party, but it was just so nice being ""home."" We had it catered, and did a lego theme for my son. He enjoyed opening all of his presents. He and his buddies played and played. We had cupcakes, but the dog ended up getting into them, ruining half of them. We also did a piñata, and the kids enjoyed hitting it. He got a lot of new lego sets. He also got a camouflage table set and new race cars. We all had a blast.",3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA535MU7,3BXQMRHWK0KS18ESQP07OVUA535MU7,0.0

I was shocked and very upset. I can remember the exact moment when we were told by the realtor that the sale may not happen at all. The house would have to be reinspected. I prayed that things would work out. About a week after the original closing date the news came in. We would be able to move in! We were all very happy, especially my son Jimmy. Coincidentally, this was also Jimmy's birthday week. Jimmy was so excited not only about the house, but his birthday. He's always very excited when it comes to this time of year. So this year we decided to do something special. We organized a fourth birthday party and housewarming party all in one! We wanted to share this special time with all our friends and family who were very supportive all along. I can remember the joy on little Jimmy's face that day.

I had never been on a cruise before so from the time I got to the port I was in complete amazement. Once we were on the ship and did the safety class my family and I went to explore all that we could do on the ship. A lot of my family hadn't been on cruises before either so it was a new experience for most of us. We partied for days, literally, but it was so much fun. We did everything from gambling at the casino to dancing in the clubs when night time came around. Not to mention I think we all ate more food than we ever ate before. When all food is included (except for alcohol) it's hard not to stuff your face with any and everything that's being cooked on the ship. Another cool thing that a lot of us enjoyed was playing basketball on the upper deck by the swimming pool. I had no idea that I would actually be able to play a game of basketball and it would feel like I was back home on the playground. There was absolutely no movement at all on the court so there was no difference than playing on solid ground instead of a ship in the water. By the time it was time to go back home everyone in my family was disappointing because we were having so much fun. We got back to the port, went through customs, and proceeded to get into our cars. Everyone looked at each other in disappointment but agreed that we'd definitely do it all again. I had a lot of fun with my family and was grateful that my cousin decided to celebrate her birthday by going on a cruise.",,3BWI6RSP7HVSR9AJWJJD1VBHPKSE78,0.0

It is not that I don't want to. It is just because they are not receptive to it. I know I cannot shove it down their throats because they will build a wall so quick to block it out. I have to be more subtle about it. When I took my niece shopping a few months back, she brought up something that was from the bible. She was not having a biblical conversation, but she did have to mention a certain custom that was found in the bible. Naturally, she took a worldly view of it rather than read the entire book to understand the context. I was able to explain what the snippet she shared actually meant. She rarely listens when I am able to share something with her like this, but she was the one who brought it up so I did have her attention. It was like only climbing a foot up a 1,000 foot wall as far as progress goes, but this was much better than declining, which is usually what happens. I hope to have more chances in the future, but I know they will be hard to find. I am encouraged though by this. It means that she will be open once again to hear the gospel since she was this time. I just hope that I can get the rest of the family, and her, on board!",3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHRRUDPY,,0.0

My daughter and I were involved in a car accident on a morning that was already not so pleasant. I had barely gotten any sleep the night before because I had been up crying my eyes out. My cousin (who is more like a brother to me) had been involved in a very terrible car accident and was on life support. My emotions were everywhere. I gathered my daughter because I didn't want her to be late going to school. Once I got in my truck, I realized that it would not start. I had to call my mother to borrow her BRAND NEW truck, which she had just purchased two weeks prior. She came to my house and I dropped her off at her house and was making my way to my daughters school. On the four way highway, my daughter and I were in the left lane. The light turned green and I then realized that a car ahead of me was making a left turn and yielding oncoming traffic. I turned on my signal light to get into the right lane since there was no traffic coming behind me. As soon as I switched over and started to move past some of the other cars in the left lane. As I was passing the cars that were in the left lane, one of the cars came over in the right lane hitting me and my daughter. I was knocked off of the road and onto the sidewalk. I had to stay there for a moment because my daughter was yelling and screaming and my nerves were shook. I was able to move the truck from off the sidewalk and park behind the young lady who hit me and police were called. My nerves were so shaken up because I had got into an accident and for one moment my whole life flashed before my eyes, was I about to end up like my cousin?? I was also worried about the fact that I had crashed my mom's new truck which was her first concern when I called her; leaving my child and I as an afterthought. With my daughter in my arms trying to comfort her, I began to cry. Everything was going wrong in my life at this moment, and I had no one. The young lady who hit me had called her older sister there to be with her; meanwhile I had no one. I texted my boyfriend who was at work, but he gets no service in certain places..... everything was a mess. However, the young lady was very nice and offered to pay for all of the damages because she was a new young driver who didn't want to increase her insurance. Her sister saw how upset I was and gave me a hug which turned out to be very comforting. It turns out the sister worked at the local hospital and remembered seeing the ambulance bringing my cousin in the day prior. She sent her love and prayers to my family and my daughter and I went to the hospital to be examined; my daughter was fine, I had minor aches for a few days, and my cousin died three weeks later",,3C44YUNSI2BC590JWA2AVZKHQPGPDR,0.0

The kicker of all of this is we went with (2) of our best friends who were also celebrating their 15th anniversary as well.  We had the best time!  No schedules, no kids, just snorkeling, laying by the pool and beach, drinking beverages with umbrellas in them...just a great time.  We were both a little skeptical on how the trip would be with another couple, but it was great.  There was enough time spent together that made it fun, but we often went our separate ways to allow for time with just my wife and I.  Our room had the best view. We were able to look down on the pools and people watch, and have the view of the coast were the crystal clear blue water lapped against the shoreline.  The balcony wasn't as good as we wanted, but still allowed us to have breakfast out there and have some privacy as well.  One funny thing that happened was my wife had a small reaction to something, and her lips puffed up fairly large!  The swelling went away pretty quickly, but it was funny when it happened. This was a trip we planned on for years.  We debated where to go for months and months, and I am glad we went to the Bahamas.  The people were great, service was nice and the weather was outstanding.  The time that I got to spend with my wife with no worries or cares was life changing for us.  We were able to talk, relax and make our connection deeper and better than it already was.  I can't wait to see what we do for anniversary number 20, and what adventures we will experience then.",3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHHWRYUM,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHHWRYUM,0.0

You hear of some fantastic revelation some day up on the mountain, or a close encounter with nature, even a brush with some insane disaster, bringing the person onto the doorstep of death. Most people quote extraordinary event that is very unique to them and hear about how that something have come to have a great impact on their lives, changing the very manner in which they view life and perceive it. You might not find my story to be anything spectacular, but for me, it has been the one most singularly amazing event of my life. It was the day that I met my husband. He came into my life and affected me in so many ways and for which I really do not have words to describe. Yet, I will try my best to portray how his coming into my life completely changed me and gave me a whole new world to look at. One of the things that I noticed immediately when I met my husband was how safe and secure he made me feel. I remember meeting him that very first day and realizing how good I felt just being with him. It was as if a burden had been lifted from my shoulders. I suddenly felt free and relaxed, as if I had to worry about nothing in life ever again. He would be very supportive of my ideas and my decisions and would encourage me to go ahead and do what I wanted the most. He provided me with the background support that I had always needed to further to my plans but had felt so insecure before. He had a knack of making me laugh and feel good about myself and whatever was going on at that time. Aside from making me feel emotionally stable, safe, and secure, he also made me feel very secure financially. He made it look so easy, as if I would never have to worry about money ever again. He made me feel that I could trust him with no matter what. This is perhaps the reason that I married him in the first place, because of how he good he made me feel about myself: very safe, secure, and sound",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQQBUYZ,0.0

Without this man, I would surely be lost in this life. I think that it would be fair to say that he is the glue that holds this family together. I am so glad that way back in 2011, I agreed to be his girlfriend. That was one of the best decisions I have ever made. 2019 was a rather rough year for us though. It tested us in ways that I never thought would be possible. About six months ago, I was laid off from my current job due to ""budget cuts."" The lay off came out of nowhere and I was under the impression that I was secure in my job. I was devastated about it and it sent me into a depression over the following weeks. The depression continues to get worse because I was struggling to find another job. It got so bad, to the point where I wouldn't even get out of bed some days. I was a mess. Nothing was getting done around the house and the clutter was just making me feel worse about the entire situation. My husband quickly noticed. Normally, he is this stone cold guy, who rarely shows affection or his emotion. However, over this course of that week, my husband pulled out all the stops to get me out of my funk. He would come home from work and draw me a bubble bath and immediately begin dinner. There were even a few occasions that week where he would bring home flowers and a nice card for no reason at all. He left me sticky notes with little affirmations about how much he loved me and how amazing I was all over the house. He even did the dishes a few times, the right way. Not once did he make me feel bad about not being able to find a new job after the layoff. I knew he was stressing out about it, but he never let on that he was stressed at all. He was doing anything that he could think of to just make me smile and make me feel like I wasn't worthless. That week, I realized I won the lottery with him. My husband truly and unconditionally loves me.",,3C6FJU71TRFSVP369SOIIQHHQQBUYZ,0.0

He didn't expect that. When he asked me that question, I thought, ok , this is it! He must be getting ready to ask me on Valentine's Day. I already knew what my answer would be, but I was wondering how would he do it. So, Valentine's Day comes and goes and still no proposal. We did go out to dinner, so I was starting to wonder what was going on. I knew he was going to ask me, but at this point, I didn't know when or how. So, I waited and waited. Every now and again I would throw out little hints. I made sure to send him a picture of the ring, so he would always have it.  Finally, it happened. One day while we were driving through the city going to a new restaurant that opened on the wharf.

We were supposed to be home, while my children's father was working. However, his boss ended up giving him the day off at the last minute. Because of this, we decided to do something fun with our last day of the weekend. There were plenty of places that were closer to us than six flags, being that six flags was three hours from us. However, we hadn't been there in many years, and our children had never been. So, we decided to go there. It was so much fun, and our children loved every ride they were able to go on. The only thing that was hard was that we didn't have much time before closing time.  The lines were ridiculously long, and we didn't have the flash pass. We did get two free skip the line tickets each though, so that worked out okay for the most part. We also got some fries with cheese to eat, and the cheese was the best thing ever! Being a member of the park, we were also treated to free soft drinks all day long at the park. Overall, it was an amazing family outing! I can't wait to do it again sometime soon!",3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA851597,3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA851597,0.0

The kids had no idea where we were going until I was getting off the freeway at Magic Mountain Pkwy. Theire eyes lit up as we pulled into the nearly empty parking lot. We had so much fun! We rode X2 and Viper and Batman The Ride. We ate some burgers for lunch in the park and continued riding as much as we could. We stayed until the park closed just after dark and rode a couple of the rides in the dark. Before we left, we made sure to get some funnel cake in one of the shops by the main gate. On the way home, it was burgers from Wendy's and a long, exhausting drive. The boys had so much fun, it was their first time at Magic Mountain. Next time, we definitely will plan it out a little more. That way, we've got even more time and more fun. We're thinking of getting season passes.",,3CCZ6YKWR85W995J0FOUBXWA851597,0.0

The reason for this was twofold. Number one was to be closer to family already settled in california. Number two was a sense of needed change in our lives. We are seniors and the whole experience was very daunting. Selling our house that we lived in over 40 years was a struggle. Then we had the issue of what to do with our to beloved dogs.  This caused internal family problems that still haven't been totally resolved as of this date. Finding a new place to live remotely was an issue that was helped somewhat by the help from our family and by extensive use of the internet. As it turned out, we ended up with a home that someone off offhandedly remarked was available and it turned out to be just right for us. Next objective was to buy a car. Very little funds were available. The car shopping took time. Many hours spent shopping around. Finally the right car at the right price was found.

I spent that entire day on the phone with friends. Telling them the news and talking to them about it. It was great the way that everyone came together so quickly to support each other.

It was such an emotional event. When it was time to give eulogies, his parents were the first ones to speak. They showered him with lots of praises. Then came his siblings who had nothing but love and joy to spread.  When it was my turn to speak  I was worried I could not match what all these people had said. I thought to myself that they had already said everything there was to say about this amazing person.  My mind ran blank, I tried looking at the paper I had written but it was unhelpful. I just decided to step up and give my friend the best eulogy i could imagine. When I held the mike to speak, tears started flowing the same way words were from my mouth. I don't know how long I took but by the time I was done i felt relieved. When I looked at the faces of the people listening, I realized that I had touched some people's hearts. When we left the event it was around 6pm. My mind was bringing me all the memories we shared with my friend. I started to miss him.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWWPGON98,0.0

I had felt it was just a normal stomach upset so i got antibiotics. Although, this wasn't the first time I would be feeling this pain. I have actually been feeling it for some years now but I have always attributed the pain to something else. I at one point in my life felt it was as a result of wearing underwears that were to tight, So i changed them and the pains still persisted. At another time i felt it was because my belts were to tight so i reduced the rate at which i used belts all together but the pains would always come back. Then, i gave up trying to find the solutions and endured the pains, and then after a while the pains left only for it to resurface after some months but then then the antibiotics worked which made me so sure it was going to work again this time  but it didn't.So, I got antibiotics, used it and expected to feel better but things got worse. It was so bad i couldn't sleep all through the night, the following day i had started calling people as early as 3 am in the morning. When help eventually came i took antacid and still nothing improved. So i was rushed to a nearby clinic and after diagnosis, i found out i had acute appendicitis and required immediate surgery. I  had the surgery and got better. This may look like a normal write up but there is no way i would be able to express the immeasurable pains i felt in this write up. After the surgery I tried to find out the cause of my predicament, i was told a series of things, some were applicable to me and weren't but i still found everything confusing because i have friends who almost the same i do and didn't have to suffer from the pains i did. I'm happy I'm happy I'm better now though, which i feel is the most important thing.",,3CPLWGV3MPL0ZYBP4FKG5EWW0RC9NF,0.0

Lisa from accounting will be cross with me, and I was really feeling like we were becoming friends. I can't be really too selfish, though. The reason we were called down, which he failed to mention to me on our day-long journey here, is that his dad is sick. One look at him, and I knew it wasn't good.

I just remember looking into her eyes and seeing the love that she has for me.  After the ceremony cocktails were served and around 5 PM people started to sit in their seats.  The wedding party was then introduced.  We stat down and had a good dinner.  Afterwards the maid of honor and my best man gave their speeches which contained the most embarrassing stories for my wife and my past. The story my brother, the best man, told caught me off guard and I was shocked and surprised and embarrassed all at the same time.  After a few good laughs everyone headed for the dance floor.  Around this time I started to reflect on how amazing it was for all of these people to take time out of their busy lives and come and celebrate with us. After a few hours of dancing an mingling everyone started to head for home or back to their hotels.  My bride and I went back to our hotel and had a few good laughs about or experience that day.

I'm so excited to announce that I HAVE MOVED out of my FAMILY'S house and INTO MY OWN APARTMENT! I can't believe it finally happened! It's the cutest little one bedroom flat, overlooking downtown too! It has this perfect little breakfast nook tucked behind the kitchen that's perfect for reading, or now writing in this. I think it'll be the perfect little spot to do homework in the evenings. I've been doing some shopping for decorations and things, and I think I'm leaning mostly towards teal and pink, maybe some gold. A girl has to have some glitter in her life. I have the best balcony, so I'm waiting for dad to build me a flower box to put out there. I bought some begonias, so for now they're just soaking up the sunshine out there. I found some cute canvases, so maybe I'll try my hand at some oil painting and spruce it up some more. The grocery store is just right around the corner, but carrying all the groceries up eight flights of stairs is starting to annoy me. Maybe I should buy less at a time. The one thing I miss about being at home, is mom doing my laundry for me. I never realized how much I despise doing my own laundry. I can't do much at a time either because carrying them up and down the stairs is a pain. Maybe I should find a laundry service near me. Work is also one block away and that helps considering my commute was over twenty minutes before. I'm enjoying this newfound freedom so much! I guess I should get back to hanging up some pictures and frames, maybe some cooking. I'll write again soon :)",,3CP1TO84PUNL9PKKF69F1AOWSNZ25M,0.0

I did the legwork for the place we were going to.  I contacted each person and gave them the name of the restaurant and how to get there.   I even sent them a link to the restaurants website so that they could look at the menu.   For those out of town, I sent them a link to a hotel site so that they could find lodging.  For some I helped them with directions on how to get to the restaurant.  I answered any and all questions that I could.   The day of the event, I was at the restaurant early to get the seating in a oval so that we could all talk to each other.   I also had name tags for everyone to wear so that we would know who was who.   23 had signed up, but only 15 actually came, which was disappointing.   One couple got lost and she didn't have my phone number with her to call.   Nor did she think of calling the restaurant and asking for me or for directions.

I only hope in the future that I continue to make improvements. I will continue going to physical therapy three times a week. This will guarantee that my strength will increase and as a result walking with the walker will become easier. Ultimately, it is my goal to advance to walking with forearm crutches.

This gaming tournament is 7 weeks long and we play twice per week. So, this totals in 14 games for the season. Before every game that we played, we would practice with other teams. This is called scrimmages and we would do as much as we can do get the feel of the game. All in all, me and friends would play at least 5 scrimmages per day to get the practice in. In these scrimmages there are ups and downs. Sometimes we won't like to play any scrimmages at all because we be burnt out. Sometimes we will not be in the same page as a team and we would just get frustrated from each other. The lesson that we learned from this is that, we need to rest sometimes and not just play all the time. So, our plan changed every week to practice. Long story short, we ended up winning twelve out of the fourteen games of the season. This means that we were in the playoffs after a long season. The playoffs will start 3 weeks after the season ended, which is bad for us in my opinion. It was bad for us because we got comfortable and we would stop practicing because we think that we were better than our opponents for the playoffs. Long story short we lost this playoff game and were out of the tournament. I was disappointed because we put a lot of time in this game and we would just get kicked out of the tournament in the first day of playoffs.",,3CTOC39K38C02PWBAKU4YBO9LU6J7B,0.0

In fact, there is documentation of the coworker having made racist and homophobic comments, in the past. Because I reported the incident, I have been targeted by my superiors. My evaluation was unfair and they have singled me out for ""guidance"", expecting me to perform better then every other employee. The coworker I complained about has been involved in a new incident. Another coworker asked him a question and he yelled while throwing his keys at the other coworker. The other coworker was hit in the chest by the keys. He filed a police report and the police officer wanted to investigate. when the incident was reported to the county attorney, she decided to do nothing.

I was one of the people involved in the preparations for his wedding. Later on, I found out that a friend of mine, with whom I had gone to the same school, was also a friend of my cousins. We had been friends for many years because we met when we were in fifth grade. When we found out that we were going to the same wedding, we arranged how we could go together. We also planned what we would wear. We went to the mall and bought classy suits so that we would look great for the wedding. My friend bought a linen suit because that's his favorite. I bought a very good looking regular fabric suit and got some shoes that go with it. As we were looking for shoes, we thought we'd also buy some new shirts. The store had very good and high end shirts on discount so I ended up buying two. My friend got two as well. We left the store and went to the gift shop to look for gifts that we would give at the wedding. I bought my cousin a pair of nice bed sheets and a blender. My friend bought my cousin a box of kitchen mugs. We went to the wedding the following day and had a great time.",,3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU3WO5N6,0.0

Pictured Rocks is a beautiful location. The sights are amazing. From starting in the woods, to crisscrossing rivers, to spotting waterfalls, all the way to the Pictured Rocks themselves. The titular Pictured rocks are sheer cliffs on the shore of Lake Superior. They have great coloring that gives them their name. Gazing over them is a memorable experience. Looking hundreds of feet down into the clear and turquoise waters is stunning. Lake Superior is always a sight to behold, but here is where she shines best. I really do love it there. The hike itself is fairly easy even despite a bump or two. Though, it was a bit muddy being spring. There were moments of tiptoeing and leaping around mucky mud. But it just added to the adventure. Rain was a possibility throughout the morning but it held off and the temperatures were cool and perfect. Just an all around great experience that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend the area.",3DBQWDE4Y7KHYB9D1P7ZTYRU35V5NV,,0.0

After all, we will see in the news what happened that night. I always remember what happened. For my part, I'm going to therapy. I go for long walks. I get distracted at work thinking about what happened. I see my family and I'm afraid it will happen the same.

Hope to do it again soon. So I offered up my number hoping she would give me a call back. She agreed she would. Even said she had a good time. So there is hope that she will. Could be a lot of fun.

This was a very emotional moment for me because I fought for my children for three years, and as a father looking to gain custody of his children it was very difficult. My children were being abused by their mother, and no matter how much proof I provided the courts, they still allowed her to have primary custody of the children. I have never used drugs in a my life, yet the children's mother was using regularly (that's why we separated) for three years. In order to get ""just"" three weekends a month with my kids, I was forced into taking drug and alcohol tests, anger management, etc.. During this time their mother would routinely violate the order that allowed me to see the children on the weekends. She would curse at me, threaten me, tell me I was trash, all right in front of the children. There was a small period where I honestly started to believe the things she would say to me, almost as if I had accepted that I was trash, even though I was doing everything right. I guess after a while I just started to break down, I was constantly in debt due to the cost of lawyers, and was just mentally drained. Thankfully I had my family to pick up the the pieces for me, and my children to keep motivating me. In January of 2019, their mothers neighbour called children and youth on her, and abuse was found to be taking place in the home, and in the end custody was removed from her, and given to me. The amount of relief I experienced is not measurable. The day I received the order signed by a judge, I just remember breaking down and crying. I dont think I will ever forget that day. Even though I was able to gain full custody of the children, I still hold sort of an resentment against the legal system. I honestly do believe if I was not a man trying to gain custody of his children, and the roles were reversed, it would have taken less than six months. I mean from the very beginning I had proof of the abuse taking place, and the courts just did not care. My children are safe, and happy today though. I could not ask for more than that.",3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TUE87,3DIP6YHAPDEWRNF26OBJFV7C2TUE87,0.0

It was like the best surprise I could have gotten regarding getting another car. The year and model of the car I wanted wasn't new. It had been really hard to find this kind of car with low miles, for a price I could afford, and in an acceptable color. I was willing to accept anything in the 2007 - 2010 range. People told me it wouldn't be possible to find a car more than 5 years old with low miles. Someone said, ""Good luck with that, those cars aren't made for sitting!"" Well, I came across some good luck. Because I would be making a major purchase and would have to travel a long distance to get this car, I made sure to ask all kinds of details about how the car could be in such good shape for 10 years old.  It just so happened that the car I wanted was part of a fleet of police vehicles, and not just another patrol car. It was being used by a government official and it was not driven very often. The best part of all was that on top of the car being in such good shape and the price being somewhat affordable, when I told my salesman that I didn't have as much money for a down payment as they initially requested, I was able to negotiate the down payment amount and the price of the car. I was able to negotiate the whole deal before and get approved for a loan before I even got to the dealership. I had to travel about 230 miles one way so the salesman worked hard to arrange everything in advance. All I had to do when I got there was take a test drive and sign the paper work.

My boyfriend's mother went to the doctors to get a check up. After a few test they found that she would need some more advance testing. After a few advance test, the results come back and she is diagnosed with arterial blockages. She never would have guessed. She had no signs or symptoms of such a diagnoses. She's been going to this doctor for years, she trusted him completely. After speaking it over with the doctor for a solution to this problem he says a stent surgery would be necessary. She gathered us all around to tell us the news. We were hurt to say the least. We didn't want to lose her or anything bad to happen. We backed up her choice to listen to her doctor, we figured she knew best and this was her body. In the back of my head I felt she should have gotten a second opinion cause she had no symptoms for this, there was no sign of it, how did this doctor get this conclusion. But she reassured us that her doctor knew what he was talking about it and she was taking it from there. My boyfriend and I took her to the hospital that morning of the surgery. She was nervous, we were nervous. After, what seemed to feel like an eternity, just 3 hours, the doctor returns to us with news. He tells us she is now in recovery but he has bad news. It turns out she really didn't need the surgery. Her test came back and there was a mistake where her results got mixed up with someone else's. They started the surgery without more test, without a second opinion. We were in outrage, his mother is old she doesn't need unnecessary surgeries. We are seeking out a lawyer in this matter for medical fees.",,3DPNQGW4LM1RV7ZLO328MVZUJ9F46A,0.0

I was staying at my parents' house because my father was in the hospital, and I was alone. I woke up in the middle of the night with chest pains. The pains went away, so I convinced myself nothing was wrong, but when I woke up in the morning I felt unwell. My father was supposed to come home from the hospital that day, and my mother had spent the night at the hospital with him; I was supposed to drive my mother's car to the hospital. Instead, I called an ambulance for myself and went to the emergency room, unfortunately not in the same hospital where my father was. I called my mother so she knew what was going on, and she tried to hide it from my father, but he somehow figured out something was wrong. Meanwhile, in the emergency room across town I was having wires taped to my chest, answering a lot of questions, and having blood drawn. And then I waited. I was there for a long time, just waiting. My brother came by to stay with me for a while, until he had to go pick up my father at the other hospital. It soon became clear, through the monitoring and the blood work, that I had not had a heart attack. I had to do a stress test, which involved walking on a treadmill to get my heart pounding, and then I went back to waiting. I spent at least three hours after the test sitting in my emergency room cubicle, waiting for the results, or some kind of answer. A nurse came in and did a double-take when she saw me–she had no idea I was still in there. Finally, after about 8 hours in the emergency room, hours that combined terror and boredom in a toxic stew of emotion that ended with anger and frustration, and doctor came in and told me I was fine. Maybe it was just stress. I was given a list of reasons for chest pain, and released to go sit in the waiting room (still in my R2-D2 pajamas, which I had been wearing when I called the ambulance) for my sister-in-law to pick me up. It was a weirdly anticlimactic ending to it all, although preferable to actually having a heart attack, but the fear lingers to this day.",3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92WKSWP6,3DQQ64TANH7BEF0AD570NN92WKSWP6,0.0

My wife and I drove down to visit her sister and her sister's husband since we hadn't seen their new house yet. We went down for the 4th of July, partied, talked, and had a great time. The most memorable night was the evening of the 4th of July. It started to rain hard in the afternoon and we had to cancel going to an event we were going to go to to see fireworks. However, this turned out to be great. We got to drink, party, and have a bunch of fun together at home visiting. I'm glad this happened because it allowed us to spend more time with each other. Events visiting family like this are my favorite because I just love connecting and spending time with people. It brings me a lot of joy to visit with family. Plus, once you have a little bit of drink in you it allows you to open up and talk more. I think we had a great time connecting and bonding with each other. I wouldn't trade it for the world. I hope that we get to spend time with them again soon. Maybe next time we can rent a beach house and go to the beach for a week or weekend. It's great to have family that you can talk with and bond with.",,3DUZQ9U6SNAVCIGXFC6YWQVZ350SVM,0.0

It was fun socializing with everyone. Until the actual wedding started they thanked everyone for being there and had great speeches. When they finally said their vows and did the ring and everything it was perfect and beautiful. The after party was especially memorable for me we had so much fun. We drank a lot and danced so much it was great. Overall just a great wedding really enjoyed it. I will be remembering it for a long time. I suppose the best thing was how sweet they were to each other. They were so cute and made for each other. I wish my wedding had been half as amazing.

I noticed that my boyfriend was immersed in a very long conversation with my girlfriend from childhood. I didn't really think much about it because I talk to my friends. We were all very close so this didn't catch me completely off guard. I went through only a little bit, nothing seemed out of place, and I felt bad for invading his privacy. I decided that I would never do that again because I didn't suspect it was possible for him to cheat. A few weeks later, I noticed some of her clothing was at my house after I went on a trip with some other girlfriends for the weekend. I was very concerned now, and had to get a hold of his phone again. When I finally succeeded, I found out clearly they were having an affair. I was completely crushed and went into a great depression. After much debating with myself, I decided to break up with him. Now I am trying to repair my relationship with my girlfriend.

I literally had to depend on my spouse for feeding, me, doing all the cooking and cleaning, all the house maintenance, getting me bathed and all the laundry. So many things you take for granted when you are mobile, it's hard to express how helpless and dependent you feel, when unable to do the simplest thing for yourself. I was so grateful to have the kind loving support of my wife of 35 years to help me when I needed it. We were also surprised by the generosity of our new neighbors, as we had just moved into the neighborhood a few short months before. Everyone started bringing us food, like, a lot of food!. We ate on it for at least a month, having put several things away in the freezer. They were really a godsend. When I finally was able to put some weight on my foot, I transitioned to a knee scooter for awhile to help me get around, as walking was still slow and painful. Several months of physical therapy was extremely helpful. I also belonged to a gym with a pool where I was able to gently exercise my new ankle. This month is my six months post op appointment. I am walking and gardening again (my favorite) hobby. I am very pleased with the outcome so far. Having had this surgery, I would recommend it. I have been pain free for several months now.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2,,0.0

One day I sprained my ankle while running and injured it pretty badly. Because I had no insurance at the time, I could not get it seen to by a doctor. Anyway, fast forward 4 decades (I'm 64 now) and have bone on bone arthritis in my right ankle joint. I was in a lot of pain daily and was having trouble walking any distance. So, in April of this year I, found a doctor who actually does ankle REPLACEMENT surgery. Now, prior to about 5 years ago, this was unheard of and the only thing available was a fusion of the ankle bone, which is probably why I did not have anything done earlier. The surgery is so new, that there are no predictions as to how long the joint will last, because there is no long term data yet. But, in April I took the plunge and had my right ankle replaced. Although the recovery is said to last up to a year (I'm 4 months in), I am walking without pain for the first time in years. I was unable to bear weight for one month and have had three months of physical therapy retraining my ankle to walk again. I still have a long way to go to recover my balance when walking and doing the kind of hiking and walking I love to do, but I feel it will all be worth it in the long run. When I have fully recovered, I should have 98% mobility in my ankle, which is a far cry from a fusion. I am very thankful I waited for the right time and technology to come along. It never ceases to amaze me when I think about the advancements in medical science that are happening so quickly. I'm just glad I have a new ankle, and my friends all call me the Bionic Woman.",3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRG94BPQ2,0.0

Everyday is a new chance that God had allowed to overcome sins. Its like when you use your finger to reset the game or computer. Making an attempt to beat your last high score. LOL. Thanks be to him for those moments of success. So depending on what  the goal is for that day. We figure out how it could be more efficient or done quicker at times even more sustainable for the ones that care. So I will share one of my moments with you. I am currently on the job of getting more people to keep one of the first loves that God blessed us with. So in this respect I am speaking of the earth and more specifically eliminating our footprint in consumables and waste. I make the example 1st by keeping in mind what and how much I eat. I use two tools the scriptures with my brothers the Israelites and the vegan community. Those give me a sense of accountability and discipline. Even though just the thought of Gods power alone is the greatest and most humbling motivator. I am prone to use the practical things I can see on the daily. And a quick shoutout to the most high for Godspeed which is faster than lightspeed it allows for the word not coming back void. Just being able to see a problem understand a solution then praying with working to solve it is a great miracle and another example of the blessing I cherish from God.,3DY4FPOOA2AJB3GK0N6T6GQ3REHRVT,,0.0

I was meeting with the new clients at the office and the suggested we go do something really different. I wanted to impress them so I pretended I was on board and said I'd try anything. White water rafting! That is what they suggested! I was terrified. I can't swim, and I am scared of boats. I felt like an idiot admitting those things, and I really needed to impress these clients, so I agreed. I acted excited. I was so scared I couldn't even breathe. When we got to the river it became obvious that I had no idea what I was doing. I couldn't put the safety gear on without help. I felt a lot better that at least everyone knew I was a fraud, but that didn't get me out of participating. They insisted I follow through. I could have refused, but then they wouldn't have wanted to work with me anymore I was afraid. The entire day was amazing. I have never been so scared but so alive in my entire life.

After speaking to my immediate manager as well I thought that this would be the correct course to take. After putting in my application/resume to make sure I get interviewed I got to work. There were only a couple of online courses that I had to take but these really prepared me for the qualification tests. This took about three weeks to complete but after I finished my confidence was really high. The day of the interview I prepared myself as much as I could. Getting a good night's sleep as well as buying a new outfit to wear really had me feeling good. I went into the interview that included my immediate manager as well as the district manager. During the interview I felt somewhat of a weird vibe from the district manager and he implied that I was not experienced enough yet. I pointed out the qualifications that I had recently obtained and was told that these were standard and that everybody had them. There was little that I could do except answer their questions and sell myself as much as I could. I pointed out that I had strong performance reviews for the last year and that I was 100% up to the challenge. This was not good enough though I was told to apply next time this position comes open as it should only be 6-9 months before another team member is added. This was pretty sad for me but after having lunch with my work friend he helped me to see things in a new light and be happy that I have these added skills for future use.,3DYGAII7PMU6UI4O1W8UVYRGZGOQPU,,0.0

I remembered about 5 years when i got admitted for my studies. I was to study Agriculture from University of Los Angelos. I was glad to take this opportunity. All effort was made so i can get the best result i could.  I attended all my classes and did all my assignments and projects. 4 years later i graduated as the best student in my college. The graduation ceremony which took place a year ago was a memorable one for me. What made it memorable was that i swept all the award of my college. My parents were overjoyed at the success of their kid. My joy couldn't be contained.  I'm so glad that all my efforts were not wasted. I will always tell my kids about this day to inspire them to put all their efforts in whatever they do. I learnt that i can be whoever i want to be as long as i'm focused and dedicated. I will be glad to share my story with the world.,,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWDXI1I1,0.0

Of all the terrible things I've dealt with in my life, now at the ripe age of 50, I had to deal with more. I was just in my kitchen, baking some cookies for my grandchildren. They were supposed to come over later after their classes. I was so excited to see them, I love them dearly. It was after mixing all the ingredients, that I suddenly felt off. I began to feel some weakness and tingling in my arms, and my vision became a bit blurry. I needed to sit down before I passed out. After some time, I felt a bit better. I knew exactly what was happening to me, though. I had a mini stroke. A couple of years back, I had fallen off of a scooter when I was trying to teach my grandkids. That had led to a subdural hematoma, and I knew the risk of a stroke had increased. I needed to make my way to the hospital to get checked out, and I felt well enough to walk. Why pay for an ambulance ride that would cost me a lot of money? So, I walked to the hospital, which was not too far.",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GWSVS3B,0.0

She recounted her extreme fear of the KKK at the time. As a young black woman, she had to live her life in constant fear of being hunted down or beaten by the group just because of the color of her skin. And it was random, they chose solely based on superfician circumstances whether or not to kill someone--if they didnt have a reason, they'd make one up. However, my mother was particularly afraid. She had no one to protect her. Her father was an abusive man, not afraid to beat his children at any moment for any reason. He was a monster. I had never met him, for obvious reasons. But, essentially, he had left my mother at a young age to the wolves. He didn't care what happened to her, and she was in fear everyday that one day she would be killed, and she had no one to defend her. Her mother couldn't do anything, she was weak and sickly. So everyday she had to live wondering whether or not it would be her last day. Luckily, she survived; however, the damage to her psyche is obvious. I feel nothing but anger for what happened to her, and I can never forgive the people who did that to her.",,3DZQRBDBSM1B09EEV20SDV3GL9FS3I,0.0

After my first errand I was driving to my second errand when I received a call from my sister. After answering and saying ""ya sis"", the last thing you ever want to hear is intense sobbing and intelligible words on the other end. Clearly something was horribly wrong and I finally was able to make out that our father had unexpectedly passed. I told my sister I would be there in 10 min. I distinctly recall a bird chirping at a stoplight, a fly in my car, and a large 4 wheel drive truck next to me blaring some rock music. While a flood of different emotions from denial, to anger, to fear, to feeling lost, raced through my mind on the drive over they all dissipated when I pulled in to the park where my parents lived and saw the red and blue flashing lights of many police cars, an ambulance, and fire trucks surrounding my parent place. My heart sank. Immediately found my mom and sisters and we did our best to comfort each other eventually turning our attention to our mother as she had been with my dad since being a teenager, now 63, and she knew nothing else. Spoke with the police and they eventually agreed to allow only myself in to see my father. He had died in his bed from a suspected, turned out to be true, drug overdose. Everything was a blur after that for the next few days. After we got through the funeral we turned our attention to our mom and her future. She couldnt stay there anymore, so we sold the place in a few weeks time. But now we had to find out where mom would live. Eventually we decided she would be primarily with my little sister and her family, but she could rotate around and stay with myself and my other sister if/when she wanted to. The first 3 months were the most difficult for my mom, but I am happy to say eventually the sun did begin to shine again for her, and us, and my mom is happier than ever and has a new job. And the rest of us have also, and continue to, settle into our new reality and we just keep getting up everyday and doing the only thing we can do, keep going forward in life.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEKI1K,,0.0

Will never forget the day. The weather was muggy and high 80's and I was driving to lunch when I received a call from my sister. The very last thing anyone wants to hear after they say hello is crying and unintelligible words, but that's what I heard. After what seemed like forever I was able to understand my 64yr old father had unexpectedly passed. My world was immediately thrown into pure chaos followed by emotions bouncing from denial to anger, all while I was speeding to make it the 15 miles to my parents. When I pulled in to the mobile park where they lived I was greeted with the red and blue flashing lights of 4 cop cars, ambulance, and a fire truck. My denial was gone. While all of us were shocked we were standing there for this reason our attention quickly shifted to our mom as she was struggling a lot. My mom had been with my dad since she was a teenager. They began dating in high school and were together for 40+ yrs. When I considered my mom was with my dad for most of her life I really felt bad for her. As my parents were poor and this was unexpected the ensuing days were very trying. How does one sell a trailer, get money for a funeral, find were mom wants to live, and grieve? Only way I got through was putting my head down and taking one step forward at a time. By working together and shaking any tree's we could find my siblings and I were able to obtain the funds for the funeral. In addition a couple weeks after the funeral we did find a buyer for my parents trailer. And lastly we decided mom's primary residence would be with one of my sisters. But, with the ability to also stay with me or my other sister when she wanted. Now the long road to healing begins.",3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEKI1K,3E13VNJ1NOHQWSX33MSVL0IWFEKI1K,0.0

I was walking near the beach on a path at the cliff. A young mother was pushing her stroller and walking her dog, talking in her airpods while her kid was watching an iPad. I noticed that there was a group of skateboarders approaching her from behind. The first skateboarder struck the edge of the stroller, knocking the young mother's iPhone onto the pavement. The skateboarder fell on the ground, and his three friends gathered to see what had happened. The young mother was startled and promptly maced all four of them. A police officer approached as he had been cycling in the area. The skateboarders scattered and left behind a leather side satchel. I grabbed the bag and sat on a bench to observe the following events and answer questions as I felt I was a witness to some kind of crime. I wasn't questioned. I went home and looked in the bag, which contained a large amount of cash. I've been holding the cash and am afraid to tell anyone about it as it could be drug money or worse.

It was probably the most difficult question for me to ask him in the 18 years we have been married.  After much soul searching, I just couldn't be in this relationship anymore.  So we asked his mom to take our children for the evening and sat down.  I explained my side to him, about how we just didn't seem in sync anymore.  You see, we had tried therapy in the past, and we both attempted to compromise in the beginning, but would go back to our old habits after just a week or two.  My husband's interests have deviated from mine.  We didn't seem to have anything in common anymore.  I would try to talk to him about my day, what I wanted to do in the future, and I grew to realize he just wasn't listening.  That's when I had to dig deep and admit that I wasn't listening to him either.  I spent many nights awake, sad about my relationship and he just didn't seem to notice.  So when we talked that night, he agreed with me.  We worked out a plan on how to separate, how to tell the kids, and go about our lives.  We've been doing this for four months now and I think things are finally starting to settle.  I miss him, the familiarness of our routine, but my unknown possibilities of the future excite me.",,3E337GFOLAUFE8YXILQQXVIJ1LUGNV,0.0

I had never been to a restaurant where I had to make a reservation before. The food was great. We got to have many different dishes that I hadn't had before.  I had a blueberry martini which is my favorite and the waiter brought me a creme brule with a candle in it. My boyfriend quietly sang me happy birthday in my ear and then we left. We then went and saw a live band at a bar that we go to quite often. They were really great.

The batch was going to be indefinite. As in, it would just keep coming. I went to go see the batch and it was really easy. I enjoyed the work and I was finally making good money on there. As it was going to be going on forever, I quit my other sources of income and focused primarily on mturk. I did other hits here and there, but really my focus was to just keep doing this batch. I was making around 80 dollars a day. I started to buy more things, and I was paying off a lot of bills finally. Suddenly, I received another email. The email said my qualification was taken away. I was shocked devastated. I almost couldn't believe it was happening. I was so careful. I emailed the requester asking what I did wrong. I was going to beg them for a second chance.

It's been five weeks now but the feeling I had on that day has no diminished, and if anything could be said about it it has grown. It was on that day while I was contemplating lukewarm leftovers on the counter that my mom announced I had received a package from Jonathon. This was unexpected and curious. For the first, I hadn't spoken or written to Jonathon, Jack as I always called him in youth, in several years. To the second, I hadn't lived at home for two years while attending graduate school, and any mail delivered to me there would be odd.  Upon unraveling the package from Jack, my heart rose and sank in varying emotion. The enclosed Frisbee from Vermont College School of Arts was a specific choice by Jack designed to invoke our shared history and demonstrate his love of dog, Charles. Jack had only met Charles on one occasion but my interaction or conversations since must have made an impression as to my feelings for him. I had always thought Jack to be thoughtful and caring, but this was an unexpected surprise. I had not been in the best of moods all day or all month for that matter. The competition in my program was not what I had envisioned when enrolling in the English department nor were the endless days of meetings and workshops. I felt stunted and exhausted with little to show for my effort. Jack's gift and accompanying note was like a tablet of vitamin C that returned some sense of energy and well being to my mood after a fog of despondency. I never thought that another person would show such dedication to a memory and sense of the moment as Jack. His gift exposed a great deal about his character that most would not care to do as it would reveal a vulnerability. To care that much about a person is a fragile thing indeed and to have it demonstrated in public without an idea of the consequence frightens most from such action.",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2DOS9D8,0.0

I had recently lost my father.  we'd had a difficult relationship, but we had been working on it, so in recent weeks, we had been spending a lot of time together and really enjoying it. He had gone for being someone I dreaded spending time with to someone whose company I loved and looked forward to. I was devastated when he passed. I was working at a job I hated. The environment was toxic, and it did not even pay well. I wanted to leave, but the hours were so long and irregular it made looking for a new position difficult. Worst of all, I was lonely. I was single, and felt like nobody cared about me. Of course, it was my schedule and impecunious state that made it hard to socialize, but my brain translated that to me being boring and unloveable. The one companion I had, and one of the joys in my life was my dog, Buster. He was always happy to hang out with me, and greeted me when I came home from work. He was always enthusiastic to see me. So, one day, I came home and found a package on my porch. It was from a friend in the city where I attended college. I thought she had forgotten me, as I though all my friends had. I opened the package, and it was a little faux sheepskin person, shaped like a gingerbread man. It squeaked when I squeezed it, There was also a card telling me how much she missed me, and saying the toy was for Buster. I gave it to him, and he loved it immediately. It's nowe his favorite plaything. I was so grateful for this kindness, and it inspired me to get in touch with some other old pals. Guess what? They don't hate me after all!",,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2DOS9D8,0.0

My son got a job in a completely different city and state and even part of the country than we live in. I needed to help him search for apartments. I had to find something that would be safe and something that was a little cheaper. This was an emotional time for me because even though my son has been off to college and graduate school he was always in the same state as me.  We needed to help him pack up his things from his Graduate School apartment and get him off to start his new career and life. I was very sad and happy and proud at the same time. I think that part of me didn't want him to move away.  It made me think about when I was his same age and it was at that time that I moved away from my family. I remembered how my father cried and cried. He was very sad and didn't want me to go. Little did I know that would be the last time I saw him. So it made me think about that as I was packing up my son's things. I am grateful for today's technology that allows us to physically see each other. I will miss the face to face time.,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2CA1D9S,3E7TUJ2EGD8RDMKCFL6D99K2CA1D9S,0.0

They said it would be a reunion . I asked what they wanted me to bring and they told some things I could bring. I asked them why were they doing it because I thought maybe my dad was sick and nobody informed me of it. He is turning ninety this year . The one cousin I asked said just to come in, I think. So it kind of worried me  that something might be wrong with him.  But they came in and a lot of people were there and we had a good time. We ate and took pictures and showed each other pictures of all our families and people in our family who had died.  It was sad because our grandparents had died and all of my cousins parents had died . There was no one left on my dad's side but him. All his brothers and sisters and their spouses were dead. We gave each other small gifts and made to go boxes of left over food for everyone and then cleaned up the kitchen. One of my cousins was a photographer and we went outside and took a lot of outdoor pictures of everyone and later he put them online for us. It was good to see everyone and it felt like when we were all kids and were at our grandparents house eating her food and seeing each other, like at Christmas or Thanksgiving.  Most of them brought the food that grandma made when we were growing up so that made it feel even more like a family reunion .  It was a fun day and sad also when my dad gave a little speech at the end and said how proud he was of all of us. He teared up some and I think everyone else did too. It was sad because everyone has to die and we aren't here for very long. It made us aware of that I think and it was sad but also fun to see everyone.  We made plans to see each other again in September and I am looking forward to that . Some of them have to fly in so not sure how many will make it.

It was incredibly unexpected and surprising for me and my family. He had only went into the hospital about two weeks prior. Two days prior to his death, he went to a rehab facility and they even expected him to be able to go home in about a week. Everyone thought he was going to be okay, but he suddenly took a turn for the worst. He was a heavy drinker, but no one saw his sudden death coming. I was a bit upset and it caused me a significant amount of stress because my parents and I are his only family. We are the ones left to sort everything out and pay for the minimal funeral expenses. He didn’t have a will. He didn't have many assets and certainly no cash to help us with the costs. All he had was us and a share of my grandmother's house.

I can't believe how clumsy I am.  I was taking things out of my basement this morning, so I could sort through them upstairs in my spare time.  Well, I was pulling on a trophy that was in one of the boxes, when the thing let loose and I hit myself in the eye with it.   There was blood everywhere and it did kind of scare me so I called my sister up and asked her if she could take me to the hospital, she said she would.  We waited at emergency for 4 hours.  I had developed a bad headache and went to lay down in the vehicle.  I finally got called in and the doctor said, go home and I would be fine. He gave me a prescription for pain killers.  Well, I thought everything was fine and I just needed rest but when I returned to work on Monday with a black eye, my headache came back.  My friend at work took my back to the hospital.  and the doctor told me that my eye was hemorrhaging and I would need surgery immediately to save my eyesight.  He added, ""Thank God your friend brought you back to the hospital.""  I had to stay overnight at the Hospital.  It looks like I won't be having that garage sale for a couple of weeks now.

Veronica and I had dated since high school. I thought she was the woman I was going to marry. 4 months ago, totally out of the blue, she broke up with me. I was devastated. We did everything together. Not only was she my girl friend, but she was my best friend. I thought we had the perfect relationship. We liked the same things, we had the same friends, we could even finish each others sentences. When she broke up with me, I kept trying to figure out what was wrong with me. After the break up, I stayed in and didn't talk to anybody. I didn't want to go anywhere, or do anything. I fell in to a really deep depression. My mom finally convinced me to go see a therapist. Little did I know, that therapist would change my life. She made me realize how much I had to offer and that the break up was not because of me. I didn't see it at the time, but Veronica and I were just comfortable with one another, we were not soul mates. We had just been holding on to something because we were afraid to move on. I'm finished with my therapy and I feel better about myself than I have in a long time. As a matter of a fact, I'm going on a date next week and I haven't been this excited about anything in a long time. Several weeks after my therapy ended I realized that I could not get my therapist out of my mind. I called her up and asked her out and since I am no longer her patient, she said yes. I realize now, everything happens for a reason and it is time for me to move on.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK4GVAJ8E,0.0

I was not aware that they are a real thing that could be used to make music. They are fun and interesting to me. I started by watching videos about them and how they work.

It has been a long journey but i am ready to begin using synthesizers and the other instruments that i can play to create this music. I listen to different types of music, but synthesizer music seems to be the easiest for me to create. It is fun and intuitive. When i think about the time that i spent learning, i feel accomplished.

I am happy with my learning curve.",,3EFVCAY5L4V4231UKPMACBK45EW8JG,0.0

We had planned lots of fun things to do. We bought theater tickets, were going to attend a picnic, watch fireworks and spend a day at the lake. The first morning she was at our house she laid in bed until about noon. My husband decided it was time to have a talk with her about responsibility. She spends a lot of time at our home because her home situation is less than desirable. We spend a lot of money trying to give her things and experiences that her parents don't provide. We attend her school events, buy her school clothes and dresses for school dances, buy her food, drive her where she needs to go, take her to look at colleges and take her on vacation with us. My husband tried to explain to her that he would always be there for her, even if her parents are not, but it is a two way street. We had been talking about buying her a car and helping her get her driver's license. He meant well with his talk, but his tone of voice intimidated her and she ended up locking herself in the bathroom and crying. It took hours for her to come out. When she did, she called a friend to come pick her up. She left and I haven't heard from her since. She deleted me from her social media. It was very hurtful because I have invested a lot into the relationship and also because she is family.",,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWTXW1JB,0.0

Recently, I caught a coworker  watching pornographic clips on his work computer. I noticed that the coworker was late in presenting his work to our group and went to ask why. When I arrived at his desk he was busy watching pornographic videos. I had to bang his desk to notify him that I was around. I asked politely about the report and that is when he started shouting at me. This alerted the supervisor who came fast and found the coworker still talking to me. The video clips were playing on his work computer all along. The supervisor took the case to management and the coworker was relived of his duties immediately. After a week, the coworker was rehired after he threatened to sue the company. The company fearing on the bad image the story might bring, they hired him back. Funny enough, he was given a managerial position, a position I should have been promoted to. Because the company had already promoted one person to the managerial position, I was forced to wait for another year to see whether I can be promoted. I wonder how is this even possible. Someone who should be terminated is now literally my boss. I do not know how I am going to submit reports to him knowing I was technically the reason he got fired. I feel like resigning.

I loved my mother very much, she was a very endearing human being and was outstandingly selfless. I remember it was a difficult adjustment when I first started taking care of her, there was a lot of arguing over who was taking care of who. Over time the arguing became less and less as she slowly started to realize she needed more and more help around the house, I think it hurt her pride to ask for my help around the house. A year before the idea of assisted living even crossed my mind we had a pretty serious incident that led to her hospitalization. My mother had seemingly walked out of the house in the middle of a snowy winter day and didn't remember doing so; she didn't even dress properly for the outside. She proceeded to wander aimlessly around the neighborhood until a bus driver took her aboard and back to the police station. Fast-forward from that event and the decline became too much to bare. I had to have her under constant surveillance as she'd slip without notice or find a way to accidentally harm herself while doing something that should have been mundane. I had managed to work up the nerve to get her into assisted living. The nerve wasn't mine alone as the doctor's also seemed to agree that it was time she entered this stage of her life and it was the safest way to do so. I agree with them and to an extent I think my mother would have too if she was still in full cognitive function. Sadly, I can only gesture and assure with kind words to her that I'm not forgetting about her or leaving her behind every time I visit. Three months have since passed and I've adjusted. I think my mother has adjusted as well but I'm still harboring guilt. So long as she's taken well care of I shouldn't have any issues, but I still wish I could take care of her in her own home that she raised us in.",,3EF8EXOTT2HMR3H9L4DVX1XWQC5J1T,0.0

We had decided early on in the planning that we didn't want to stress our wallets too badly on this wedding, and would rather spend out money on a lavish honeymoon. Still, the venue we found, a vineyard out in the countryside, was stunning. The morning of the wedding I woke up at my brother's. Cheryl thought it would be bad luck to sleep in the same bed the night before the wedding. Despite the wedding not being until that afternoon, I showered and put my tuxedo on right away. My brother was my best man, so he helped keep me calm. In no time at all the wedding time rolled around, and we went to the venue. I will never forget how I felt when I saw Cheryl walking towards me in her beautiful white dress. We said our vows and quickly went to the reception area. We danced and ate late into the night.

We each gave examples of how bad our dating lives had been in the past. When we reached the top of the mountain, we did barbecue and had some kebabs. For some reasons, my stomach wasn't in the mood for kebabs and and started giving me trouble. I started wanting to go to the bathroom so much and asked my friends if there was a bathroom around. They all laughed at once because there was no way that forest had a bathroom. They advised me to go in the woods and finish my business there. I looked for a very hidden area and went there to defect. I was surprisingly comfortable and unafraid. As I was defecting, I saw a red shaped fruit and I tasted it.

We got free tickets because my best friend was a vendor for the festival. He was stoked to be able to provide a service for the event and also get free tickets to be able to share with his friends. We all met up in his hometown the night before and went out to eat. The next day, the day of the festival, my best friend had to head in to work for the festival, and the rest of us start the pre-festival activities. I wasn't expecting to have the best weekend of my life, but I have got to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. I have to say that it wasn't the festival that made this weekend so unforgettable, but the people that I was able to share it with. It has been a while since all of my high school friends were able to get together for a weekend getaway, but this only made me miss them more. We had an absolute blast! There was music of all sorts there. There were also a lot of art vendors that had all of their awesome artwork on display. I got to try foods that I had never heard of. The festival lasted well into the night, and we were all able to share experiences with each other. Overall the weekend was amazing. We all said our goodbyes in the end, and are looking forward to doing the same thing again next year!",,3EICBYG645I6E6R7112FEXGNXSAJC2,0.0

It was wonderful to be able to show these things to my children. Luckily we had a nice selection of movies to watch for them. We ended having to get a hotel room to rest up after the first day of driving. That night, I got some of the best sleep I have had in a very long time. It felt good to get away from the place I was at before. That hot shower in the morning was one of the greatest feelings. We took off again on the road, after making sure we had everything. We continued onward to our destination. But had to stop after a few hours to take one of the kids to the Emergency Room.

What started out as a fun trip for my world history class ended up helping my decide what I want to do with my life. During this trip, I met people and saw things that I had seen in textbook but never in person. It was a sort of transcendent experience for me; I never wanted it to stop. It was this trip that I really started focusing on my life beyond school. For my trip overseas, we as a class was offered the chance to go to Italy. the main point of the trip was to absorbs the art and culture of the region where great artists Davinci and Michelangelo. During this trip, me and a group of classmates were able to enter one of the churches, and what I saw inside changed me. We were surrounded by rich, striking art depicting angles, man, God, and animals. I felt a deep, deep sense of peace and relaxation as I walked around the church, letting all this art and culture wash over me like a tsunami. After leaving the church, which was very hard for me to do, I knew what I wanted to do with my directionless life. I really wanted to pick up art after that trip. I changed my major from undeclared to art immediately after coming back from the trip. I talked to my friends about the art teachers they had in prior semester to get a sense of what the classes were like, and I went to the art department to talk to the professors directly. I started my life as an art student this semester, and the experience so far has been all that I imagines and more. I have never felt more fulfilled as I am now, and I have never enjoyed going to school as I am enjoying doing so now.",,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,0.0

As we were walking through the city and meeting with CEOs i realized just how small we all are. We went up to this place called MT etna and i secretly took acid with one other member of our group and i just had a sense of clarity up on the volcano that i dont think i will ever have again any time soon. Everything up there seemed in place looking at how the bees would fly around and the grass would sway even looking out over the city it all felt as if it was in its place. It all somehow came together to form life in a strangely organized way. Afterwards on my own i took the time to visit a cemetery one of which was rough a mile long it was a big circle (the city was catania). There i wept for the child graves and the graves that were forgot by everyone, i wept for my own death and the deaths to come of everyone i knew and loved. At the end of it though i had a much deeper understanding of why it is we must be grateful to even wake up in the morning. There was alot of joyful moments however as we went out to eat and explore. The professor with us had gone before and roughly knew were to go and even knew a bit of Italian. I was the youngest in the group unfortunately. This obviously lead to teasing but i dont think it was ever out of bad intention. While walking around i ran into a lot of stray animals which was great cause it would always be the cats who ran away but the dogs who would run up to you. The ocean also took my breathe away because they have rocks along the edge and ive always seen sand so naturally i jumped off some rocks into the ocean. The timing couldn't have been better because at the time i was there apparently there was a lot of other people from other university visiting Italy at the time too. There were times where i was scared i was going to have my bag stolen from me so i kept a broken bottle in my bag just encase i had to defend myself which looking back it now was kinda dramatic.",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGH32D1,0.0

My eyes were getting tired quickly and I was experiencing a lot of mild headaches due to eyestrain. The doctor did a thorough examination and immediately noticed how terribly misaligned they were. He recommended me to a surgeon to get my eyes aligned. I have had misaligned eyes for almost half a century and had never considered surgery, because my older sister had surgery for her misaligned eyes and is now practically blind in one eye. I had decided to live with my condition and when I became an adult, I went through one year of vision therapy to correct the problem. Vision therapy did help, but over time my eyes went back to their old ways and turned in very significantly. The doctor explained to me that my condition is a little different from my sister's and that surgery will not cause me to lose vision, because I have alternating vision and my sister had another condition that caused her to shut one eye off completely. He said that at my age, surgery was really the only answer. So, I scheduled an appointment with a surgeon and had an evaluation done. The surgeon put all kinds of different prisms up to my left eye and immediately I saw double. The surgeon worked with me for several minutes and finally my eyes adjusted some. She told me that my left eye turned inward 70-80 points and she could only correct it to 40 points without me seeing double. She decided that it would be beneficial to do surgery on my right eye also, so that I can have at least 50 points of correction. I talked to my husband about the situation and he thought it was a good idea to have the surgery done. The surgery scheduler didn't contact me until three months later and informed me that I would have to go back down for a new evaluation before the surgery. I told her that if this was the case, I was not interested, because we had already paid $600 out of pocket for the first evaluation. She talked with the surgeon and the surgeon told her that I did not need a second evaluation, so the surgery was scheduled for August. Three weeks ago, my husband took me to the eye hospital and I underwent surgery on both of my eyes and I cannot believe how having mostly aligned eyes has changed my life! My crossed eyes have always caused people to look at me a little funny and some companies have not wanted to hire me, thinking there was something wrong with me. Children have always stared at me and asked why my eyes are so crossed. This is no longer a problem! Just last week, I took a trip into town to the grocery store and was amazed at how much better I was treated. It is also wonderful to get up in the morning and have almost perfectly aligned eyes while looking in the mirror getting ready for the day!",3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOEVX2DL,0.0

During a phase in our marriage where I thought that there was no obstacle we could not overcome, I was absolutely blindsided by this happening. Moreover, to deal with ICE, immigration court, physical deportation, flying across the world with a toddler in tow, the expense of maintaining two households, only to have my marriage end over something so much ridiculous, is highly frustrating on many different levels. The aftermath of this situation has been constant bickering, anxiety, and loss of sleep. Furthermore, I have come to realize that this man is not the man I thought he was. The financial cost has been an approximate loss of $3500 since I had already secured our return tickets. Psychologically, I am frustrated because I have had to deal with immigration laws while securing permanent residency overseas, which will obviously no longer be happening. I feel sad for our son more than anything else. Because our son is so young, it will be many years before he sees his father again, as I will not feel comfortable flying him alone for such a long flight. This has never happened to me before, I would never have expected this from my husband and it is devastating to know I have wasted so much time on a relationship that could end so abruptly. I actually found this to be more distressing than him being deported in the first place. I have contemplated working through the infidelity, but came to the conclusion that it is not the financially intelligent move to make when I have a young child to raise. This is definitely the most striking and emotionally upsetting thing that has happened to me in quite some time.",,3EKVH9QMEZQGD2ZDUCRYZMCOGI82D8,0.0

A former coworker, who I had a great working relationship with, reached out to me. She told me about how her new company was a leader in the industry. In addition, she mentioned how she was excelling in her current role with them and really enjoyed the work. She mentioned that I would be a great fit for an open position that they wanted to fill. This company was over 3,000 miles away from where I live. However, the most surprising thing is that they were willing to let me work remotely! This was definitely a surprise to me, especially since it is uncommon to have a full-time employee work remotely in this specific industry. I was shocked and extremely grateful for the opportunity. This experience was significant to me because it helped me be more grateful with my current circumstances. I also felt a closer bond to my former coworker and felt a sense of thanks, especially since she helped connect me to this position. I learned a bit more about myself through writing about this experience. I learned that I have a good network of people around me. I also learned about my specific feelings around work and my circumstances. I really need to reflect more and learn to count my blessings. We have limited time to live, and it is important for health and longevity to reflect on the good in life.",3ERET4BTVNVZRSQM72S0DMFS5VZ9KZ,,0.0

So I managed to hobble into the car and once we got there I was seen reletively quickly. It was a horrible experience because the doctor had to numb te area before sewing it up but I kept feeling the pain as she tried to begin. It was very painful. She said my body was metabolizing the pain killer too quickly. It took about 5 stabs with a huge needle right into the wound before it got numb enough for her to sew it up. Finally I got to leave.

The trip was supposed to take 2 hours, but ended up taking 3 hours because of the weather. We thought the bad weather would avoid us and stay to west of our location. Instead, the storm intensified and overtook us on the road. My husband was driving while I was paying attention to the weather app on my phone. Our three teenage sons were in the back seat. The oldest was particularly upset every time he saw lightning. It was slow driving at times because the rain became so heavy that it was difficult to see the road plus the other cars kept slowing down.         Once we arrived in the other city, we started to head to our destination, but took the wrong exit because we couldn't see the road signs. Our phones started beeping with an emergency alert. A tornado warning had been issued for the area we were in. My oldest son began to really panic. We pulled into a convenience store to determine if the tornado had touched down and where. We also wanted to see how close we were to the party location.        We stayed there for a bit until the radar on the weather app showed that the main part of the storm was well past us. My son had calmed down by this point. We got back on the highway and took the correct exit (which was the one right after the one we mistakenly took). Within minutes we were at the party place. We meet up with the rest of the group and watched one of the televisions in the place. The news coverage showed there had been a funnel cloud that touched down near where we were at. Every one was relieved to be safe inside. Once the sun came out and the storm warnings were canceled, my boys and the other teens played laser tag and raced go-carts. We were able to enjoy ourselves despite the stress and fear of the trip up there. The way home was much easier since there were clear blue skies and everyone was full of pizza and birthday cake.",3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZ957MN,,0.0

This was a devastating time in our lives.  My mom has been unsure, because of her advanced age, on what she wants to do in regards to treatment.  She can choose to do nothing and let the cancer run it's course and if that is her decision the doctors believe that should would have less than 2-3 years left to live.  Our my mom can choose to seek treatment which would require surgery, radiation, and rounds of chemotherapy over a course of the year. We are all frightened and scared, but ultimately we know that this is her decision and we must let her make it.  We can not choose the best course of action for her as only she knows or has some idea of what she wants. It's very hard to watch someone you love grapple with such a immense decision and try to select the correct choice.  Only having two plans of actions makes it very difficult. My father passed away around 4 years ago and to watch him die slowly over the course of several months was very hard.  To watch my mother die will probably be worse as she is the only parent I have left and to lose her would be devastating.  I love my mom though and what ever she decides, what ever plan of action she wants to take, I will stand beside her and support her.  I will hold her hand in life as I will hold it in death and I will always be with her and she with me because we are part of each other. So what every you choose Mom.  What every you want.  I will be by your side.  Your middle child will always be there.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQS6GM70,0.0

Out of the corner of my eye I saw blur of movement and than nothing.  I stopped walking and peered into the window of a nearby warehouse.  I saw a white blur and decided to see what was inside the warehouse.  Inside I found a litter of kittens.  Although I wanted to take all of them home I decided only to save one of them, the rest would have to fend for themselves.  I brought the snow white kitten home to my mother and siblings.  Immediately they were enthralled by the snow white beauty.  This cat has become a member of the family joining us in everything we do.  It enjoys different activities with each and everyone of my siblings and mother.  It acts quite like a human.  My mother is the proudest mother in all the world.  Having lost our father in a trucking accident we were in desperate need of something to bring the family together.  That spontaneous decision to roll a blunt and take a walk may have saved the entire family. Maybe some things are destiny.",,3EWIJTFFVPTE9YAZBKY4MG1USSS0EJ,0.0

My family and I made a trip a few months ago over to India! We have some friends and family there. I came to the United States to go to college and never wanted to move back. I met my wife in school and we have 2 children now. My folks are dirt poor as they live in India. They pretty much spend their days scrapping whatever they can get out of trash piles. Because the country is so retarded they don't know how to properly dispose of waste. Anyways, we decided that the kids would want to see their grandparents. And we thought that it would give the kids a good perspective and they may learn something. We had been there before but they were too young to be able to really understand what was going on. We really enjoy spending the time with the even though they are trash, and the country is also trash. Some of my friends who live here still though have done alright for themselves. We went and stayed a night with them as well. The food was amazing here! That's probably the biggest highlight for me outside of seeing friends and family. We joked about Donald Trump and how this may be our last trip here because of travel bans etc. that he has enacted.",,3ERMJ6L4DZEQ3X2WDH7WE3GQZBYM7Z,0.0

I looked up as I said ""sure"" to see the most beautiful girl I have ever spoken to. It was like one of those cheesy romance movies. I swear there was light around her and her hair was blowing in the non existent breeze. I tried my best to act normal and make small talk. It seemed to have worked because by time we left I had a date for later that week. Her name was Amanda. She was going to school to be a dentist and she was absolutely perfect. A few nights later we met up at the Italian restaurant and we spent hours eating and talking. It felt so familiar and safe to talk to her.

We had a great day at the beach and then decided to go for a couple of drinks.  The restaurant bar was pretty busy and noisy, but we couldn't help noticing a really cute group of guys sitting at the next table.  After about a half hour one of them came over to ask if we wanted to join them for drinks.  We did.  I found myself seated next to this really cute guy a bit older than me with dark brown hair.   We started talking and it turned out that we had some friends in common.  We also lived in the same neigbourhood.  He seemed really friendly and had a great sense of humour, which is a real plus for me.  After a couple of hours of chatting it was time to leave.  I had my car with me and my friends all seemed to have paired off with the other guys at the table.  I decided to offer this guy a lift home even though it was a bit out of character for me.  He quickly agreed and we walked to my car chatting along the way.  When we were about two blocks from his apartment he turned off the car radio and said he had to ask me something.  I thought that he was going to ask me out.  Instead, he told me that he lived with his girlfriend and that they had been together since high school.  He said that things were good between them, but that he was looking for ""a bit more"".  He asked me if I would consider being his girlfriend ""on the side.""  I asked him exactly what that meant.  He gave me a cocky smile and said ""you know.""  I told him that was not my style and pulled up in front of his building.

Drove to Boston and got everyone tickets. They were very excited as we walked through the front doors. Greeted with a huge display of penguins with a speaker telling you all about them. They were quickly drawn to the giant salt water tank in the center of the building. Giant coral in the middle of it with fish swimming in circles. We spent the next few hours walking up the along side it taking it all in. They loved seeing the turtles inside that were 150 years old.

I traveled all around the world, and even took one of those 28 day cruises across the Mediterranean down around India to Australia! I had been yearning to travel for a while, and now that I have seen so much in the last year, the world has certainly been a lot smaller. My first stop was in Europe. Specifically, Paris. While I started there, most of what I saw was just too touristy. Everything was extremely overpriced and I just wasn't feeling the culture, so after two weeks in Paris, I took a train across Europe intending on hitting as many cities as possible. About halfway through my trip, I found myself in Rome. Now Rome is incredibly beautiful and culturally rich. I really enjoyed seeing the Colosseum, and for the most part, it seemed less tourist based than a few of the other cities I encountered. I just really like the culture and history of the Roman period, so learning about that was fantastic. It was kind of crazy to consider how much of our society is structured around the politics of the Roman Republic. I was able to schedule a cruise while I was there, and it picked us up on the Italian coast. We went from Italy through the Mediterranean, making quite a few stops along the way. I think there were about 12-14 excursion ports? It was a very long trip that ended in Australia. While I was in Australia, I met a woman who had a wildlife sanctuary and she invited me to her place to see the kangaroos and koalas she had been rehabilitating. I had never seen a koala up close and personal before but she said they can be a little grouchy. I didn't have a chance to experience a grouchy koala though because they were all drugged up on eucalyptus. I stayed in Oz for about a month, and then I ended my travels by going to New Zealand and then Thailand before catching a flight back home. It was an incredible and unique experience that helped me relate a bit more to numerous cultures and people. I'm so glad I went.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJN8QA2QL,0.0

I try to do as much as possible for him because we are the only two employees and are stretched very thin at work.  He lacks common empathy and decency and despite this I try my best to keep positive and help as much as possible. I will clean up after him and try  to maintain a good working relationship with him. The incident occured when I had told him I could work a morning shift to allow him to have the day off to spend time with his son the only thing I asked was to get off a bit early so I can get some rest for the morning shift I now had to work. The same day I had done all of the pre-shift prep and spent hours organizing our inventory as well as making lists of daily tasks for our employees. I spent the rest of the day, working my normal shift which includes cleaning up his messes. Nearing the two and a half hour mark before the end of shift I asked to leave and he made me stay implying that I had done very little to no work. While this was very frustrating I remained at work until 10 minutes before close when he finally let me go home ""early"". He did this on purpose to flex his muscle and stroke his own ego. I felt and still feel very disrespected and wanted desperately to quit my job because of this incident. I continue to deal with this level of disrespect on a daily basis. Sometimes my contempt for him makes me want to seek revenge but I can't directly impact someone's life negatively. I am actively seeking another job. I hope the best for him but I can't continue to work in this environment. I hope something comes along soon that I can happily work in peace by myself. He, nor the owner, deserves an employee as competent and professional as me. I hope for the next person to take my position the climate changes at work.",,3FE7TXL1LJ9A2B3IZYXIZLJNO6Q2QD,0.0

I'd been living in the USA for two years and my paperwork was caught up in a huge backlog. It was horrible having to wait for so long, like my life was on hold until this one person could grant me the status to stay with my husband. The interview was terrifying. We were called in to the officer's room ninety minutes late. I was carrying three big binders of ""evidence"" to convince her that our relationship was real. She read the oath, confirmed our identities, and then asked a string of questions from the form. Her face was totally emotionless. I nervously joked through certain answers while my husband glared at me, suggesting self-deprecating humor was not suitable. After thirty minutes, she stood up and thanked us for our time. No white slip of paper that I had read about online. No details about when to expect the card or what to do afterwards. Just a quick shake of the hand and then ushered out into the hallway. It wasn't until the next day that I received confirmation my green card had been approved. I could stay! That was the best feeling in the world.

I was so incredibly nervous. I didn't want to lose and look like a fool in front of my parents and coaches, as well as my teammates. It was memorable to me because it marked the day I remember starting to have real confidence in myself, after I ended up winning that competition. I was only a white belt without any stripes, so I was only allowed to compete against other participants with my same ranking. I handled all of them with ease, and I knew it was because I had an incredible coach who was always teaching me important things I'd need to know. I knew my coach was telling me things the other coaches weren't telling their students, based on how easily I was beating them. The most surprising part of that day, to me, was how easy it felt to me to find ways to win. It meant a lot to me to feel confident enough in the finals of that competition, and it was all thanks to my coaches. When I won, it marked the genesis of when I truly became confident in myself, not only as a martial artist, but as a person. When I ended up winning the final match, I can remember telling my coaches that it was easy. My coaches told me it was only easy because I work harder than them, and that I'm more dedicated than them. I never thought that highly of myself.

She is autistic with some speech delay, so school is sometimes a struggle for her. I appreciated being able to take part in the celebration of her hard work. The children demonstrated some of their new skills through songs and presentations. I was especially impressed when my child walked right up to a microphone to tell the audience about learning her shapes. At the beginning of the year, she could barely hold still on stage and needed a teacher to help her. She would have been scared to talk in front of people. I was very proud of this new development. After the kids did their presentations, the families ate potluck food. My daughter wanted to eat lots of watermelon. I helped both my kids get plates, and we sat down to eat. Then my kids were running around and playing with other kids. I was impressed to see them demonstrating social skills. My son especially has struggled to play with other kids, so I was happy to see it that night. After that, we went home.",3FPRZHYEPZTRS1VIPX5XOINNEXY3VL,,0.0

They pull the good workers away from their tasks to help out with the mundane stuff that they should be able to cover. The people i could be using, are stuck aiding them, and i am stuck falling further, and further behind.

It's crazy to think about where I was 6 months ago. It feels like it was such a long time ago now. Things were so hectic, after the breakup, with the difficulties at work, and how much I was eating just to try to distract myself from everything. I couldn't believe the person I was seeing when I was looking in the mirror back then. Thinking about that, I can't believe the person I'm seeing when I look in the mirror now. It really took me hitting rock bottom, when I was struggling to walk up the flight of stairs at home and was dead out of breath for me to finally look at myself and try to get a plan together to turn things around. But I did it! Thanks to all the hard work and the support of my friends, family, and community I found myself a part of at the local gym, I was able to stick to my plan and turn things around. It got really challenging at times, especially early on when I wasn't seeing any results. It was tough to see all my friends enjoying themselves, throwing down pizza and ice cream and not being able to be a part of it. But it was worth sticking to my plan. Hey, maybe I'll be able to join them soon! I hope I can be an inspiration to someone else at some point. I want to write down all the steps I took, and all the thoughts that went through my head, especially early on.

And fifty years ago, a lot happened that summer.  My parents aren't much for big celebrations.  However, there was much discussion around how everyone was going to get together.  My dad spends a lot of time in the northern part of the state.  Was everyone going to head up there?  Were we going to meet somewhere in the middle?  Dad finally decided to come down, but he didn't want a lot of fuss made or anyone to put themselves out, so he only told my mom and me.  I think part of it was wanting to be a surprise and part of it was not wanting people to be disappointed if he couldn't make it down.  He did finally make it down towards the end of dinner, though he had to call and get directed to my sister's house as it had been awhile since he had been there.  He brought everyone something rather than the other way around, something that was supposed to have been done last Christmas, but oh well.  It was a good time, laughing and talking with almost everyone there (my older sister couldn't make it).  My parents reminisced about fifty years ago.  My mom's brother also got married that year and I don't remember ever learning that, though I might have.  It was good to see my dad and both mom and dad seemed to enjoy themselves.  It was basically just a family dinner, but it meant a little more.",,3FTYUGLFSV78CZI0CVTWXTF09QVD5L,0.0

Meeting my family under such mournful circumstances was not how I wanted things to go. We went through the viewing the day prior. The next day was the actual funeral where he was buried with military honors and laid to rest forever. My entire family was saddened at the loss of my grandfather. Each of his sons and daughters went up to the altar and gave a speech about their experiences with him. After the ceremony we all went out to have lunch at a nearby restaurant. things were nice, everyone was chatting and having fun. It was like nothing had ever happened. I spoke with my uncles and aunts about work and finding good jobs, then after the lunch we all went out to watch a movie. It was overall a great experience. We all had tons of fun.

It was very scary and exciting all at the same time. I knew I would have a transplant for a long time, as the kidney disease I had was the result of Lupus. When my kidney failure reached end-stage, I went into treatment that kept my kidney function at a certain level. It was a level that was low enough to allow you to be considered for a transplant, but not emergency-level yet. Doctors said if I could stay at that level of function, I could still live many years without needing a transplant or dialysis. After a couple of years, I started getting kidney stones and sometimes they needed surgery. They started to harm what was left of my kidney function, so I got my transplant.  The day of the transplant, I went with my husband. We had to be at the hospital very early and we left the house at 4 am. We aren't morning people and we were both nervous but there wasn't anything to really say. So we sat in relative silence for a while in the hospital room. It was about 3 hours util I went into the surgery theater. As they were wheeling me in, I couldn't believe it was actually going to happen after all the time I spent learning and worrying about it. I was very scared but I had to meet so many people and answer so many questions that it kept my mind occupied. I remember shaking with nerves while I talked to the anesthesiologist. That was the most scared I got, but it was the last thing before they started giving me medication. I don't really remember much after our conversation, until I woke up in recovery. I asked for my husband right away and I was so releived and happy. He was right there waiting so from then on he was by my side.  Once I got into my room, he stayed with me until it was late at night. After that first day I could only see him every afternoon because we lived two hours away from the hospital and he also had to keep working. I was so happy to go home after 10 days.",,3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWE3AQH3T,0.0

It's hard not only physically, with having to sort and pack and sell your things. It's hard emotionally too - leaving behind family and friends. I left behind all of my family and most of my friends - minus a few that live in Colorado already. It was sad to drive away but I was glad to have my dad with me. We saw a lot of interesting sights on our travels, including a family of moose. They were tall and elegant and beautiful but also scary to watch from the road. One of the highlights of the trip was the food we got to eat. I made sure to have a lot of BBQ and Cajun before we left Louisiana. I would not be able to have it again until I came back for Christmas in a few months. My dad and I enjoyed the time to relax from the road and also eat good food together. We ate a lot and then would be super full getting back into the car for the long drive ahead. One of the worst things that happened on our trip was a flat tire that happened in Texas. We were far away from other people and had to wait hours for triple A to come and help us fix it. Even though it was November it was luckily not too cold and we didn't freeze while we waited. I was very glad to have my dad as company or I would have been terrified waiting in the car in the middle of nowhere for that long. It was sad when my dad had to leave to go back home. I was alone in my new apartment and still had a lot of work left to do. I was scared to start my new job. But I knew that I could handle it and my new adventure.",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531F7R5GK8,0.0

It was fun and exciting to see everyone and learn more about the family and where I came from. We had a BBQ and made burgers and grilled chicken, we had a few different salads and beverages. We played a few games of charades and cornhole and just reminisced about memories we shared together and with members of the family that are no longer with us. It was so nice to see everyone, the kids all had a great time playing games together. They played red-rover and man-hunt in the woods at the campground. They all came back after playing and roasted marshmallows and had watermelon. The campground is beautiful and the lot we had rented was great because it was right by the lake with beach access. If we had brought our canoes we could have pushed right off from them. We plan to do it again next year and make it an annual event, because we had so much fun. Next year we'll definitely bring the boats and maybe we'll camp out a night or two. The facilities were very nice and I think the kids would all like tent camping. Most of my mother's side of the family is from the city so it will be a new experience for them. We should bring fishing poles too. I wished I had mine with me. I saw lots of fish jumping when the sun went down.",,3G5W44VEU84E62DUL8YA531FZJEGKT,0.0

When our first child came along, I was pretty apprehensive about being a father, since I had deliberately put off marriage and having kids for so long. What surprised me was how good being a Dad felt. My Mom had always told me, ""Its different when they're your own kids"" and damn if it wasn't true. All this ran through my mind as we drove back from dropping off my oldest son at college today. In retrospect, it all seemed to go by so fast, like things fast-forwarded from him being born until today. He is just a couple steps away from being out on his own as an adult. It was emotional experience for all of us, even our younger son, who had seemed almost happy to be the only kid in the house. Now he seems a little upset, just like my wife and I. Part of it is the knowledge that we're getting older. Retirement is just around the corner, part of the downside of starting a family late. I also worry about how our younger son feels about having parents in their 50s as a young teenager. Some of his friend's parents are a good 10 years younger than us. But we are both in good health and pretty active, so we should be around to see our youngest off to college in a few more years. Hopefully those years will go by a little slower, but I doubt it. Time does seem to go by faster and faster as you get older, another one of my parents sayings that has proven true.",,3GDTJDAPVVXU3B7FNMZ2S3CLKSHM83,0.0

I was the last hired, so I was the first fired. I had to accept a teaching job at a public school after getting used to my dreamy, safe, private school job. The pay is horrendous, it's almost like the government doesn't want kids to learn anything. I had to buy most of the supplies, and some of the kids are so poor, I ended up having to buy supplies for the kids to even be able to learn. Cheap backpacks and notebooks apparently add up.

Where we live is very touristy and it being a summer weekend, there was a lot of traffic. But there was far more traffic than normal today. We thought it was probably normal since we don't normally leave our house on a Sunday, but after waiting for a very long time, we thought there must be something wrong. After quite awhile, a vehicle started passing everyone in the opposite lane, which we thought was crazy! So my husband called one of his employees (a park ranger, which is a police officer for a state park) and told him that a vehicle just passed everyone and they were driving strange. The park ranger said that vehicle had just reached him, that they were all responding to an accident (the passer was an off-duty fireman responding to the call). There had been a fatal accident. A car with a father, mother, and three kids had pulled out in front of an oncoming large SUV. Two children died in the accident. We eventually reached the scene and it was horrifying. It made me rethink our tiny car we drive with our three sweet children. I try not to think about that day. I do, however, stay even more cautious while driving than I used to. Like I mentioned earlier, it is very touristy here and those tourists drive unsafely - people not realizing they're on a highway at a high speed and just pulling out in front of others, passing people on the shoulder, etc... it gets so hectic. I hated that day. I hated to hear that someone's children died. It was definitely on our mind for awhile.",3GA6AFUKOPAMA00YK8OT9HWEDLQH3P,,0.0

I got to see the Blue Ridge and the Smoky Mountains up close.  Until then, I had never had a vacation that was centered around nature.  It was always about visiting something that was man-made, some sort of vast structure or sight of historical significance.  It had an immediate impact on me, one of awe.  I was in awe of the vastness and the natural beauty of these structures.  They put everything that I had ever visited that was man-made to shame.  I also felt something deep inside of me that I could not immediately put a name to.  Eventually, I decided it was something like a connection.  I did not feel necessarily connected to a lot of the things I had visited otherwise - beautiful cities which were made by people long before I ever existed.  However, there was a timelessness to the beautiful scenes of nature, and though they existed before me, I felt a connection to them.  They reflected their own place in the universe, and by doing so, helped reflect man's place in the universe.  It was a humbling experience. I was not frightened by the realization that I was smaller in the universe than I thought I was.  In fact, there was a liberating feeling to it.

We went over to visit her often during treatments, went to the hospital when she was checked in for the initial treatments, and generally kept up a lot of support. Me and Kiddo thought it was important for her to know we were there for her. She seemed to be handling treatment well. Then, out of the blue, she had a massive stroke which reduced her to still alive, not needing life support, but also not able to really communicate. We had no way of knowing what she did or did not process, understand, feel, etc. So we acted on the DNR she had signed before and provided nothing but water. It was so difficult to see her there in that state, basically slowly dying and fading away. As (then) executor of her trust I began to gather everything I needed to make sure this went smoothly for my cousin (her beneficiary). It was hard to post her final goodbye to friends on FB after she passed, but I did what she asked. Then I discovered: she had not fully finished setting up the trust and I had very limited resources. Much to my surprise, I was completely unable to do everything she asked, and had to resign as executor and hand it back over to my young cousin and be there for him for support. I did what I could to give him all the info he needed and put him in touch with the trust attorney. Sadly, and surprisingly too, since I last wrote about this he has not done well.

It was so beautiful. It was right after the holidays and the place was decorated in almost a Christmas like theme but more winter. My sister looked stunning. She wore a long sleeve dress that was plain and simple but the arms and the back were shear that gave it a little something extra. I stayed with her while we got ready and got our hair and makeup done. I went for a simple up do and natural makeup. My sister kept her hair down with a clip and went for natural make up as well. We were allowed to pick out our own bridesmaid dresses as long as they were a shade of red. Her bridal party was just me and our other sister. We arrived to the wedding that evening and it was pouring. It was okay though because the wedding was inside and we did not need to worry about the weather. We finished getting ready and the guests started to fill in. I walked down the aisle and it was beautiful. It was all pine and lights, they did a great job. Then my sister walked down the aisle and she really took my breath away. She looked so beautiful and so happy. I almost cried but just got teary eyed. The wedding ceremony was beautiful  and quick. It was right to the point and I liked that. Once the ceremony was over we went to cocktail hour and they had delicious hor'dourves. The real fun was when the party began. They had great music and we danced the night away. It was a great wedding and I am so happy for my sister and able to be a part of her day.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LXCI5WW,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LXCI5WW,0.0

When our hair and make up was done, we left and went to her venue to get dressed. It was raining but that did not matter. All events were inside so we quickly ran in and did not let the rain bother us. I got to pick out any red dress I wanted to. I liked that we did not have to wear a specific bridesmaid dress. My sister got dressed and she looked so classic. Her dress was simple and really flattered her. When all was ready we walked down the aisle and had a fast ceremony. The place looked beautiful. It was still decorated for Christmas and just looked like a winter wonderland. The ceremony was quick and straight to the point but there were some really powerful moments. Once the ceremony was over the family took some pictures and then enjoyed cocktail hour. The food was fantastic and then once that was over we danced the night away. She had a great DJ that played music for everyone. People were on the dance floor all night. My sister looked so happy and for that I am very happy for her.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4LXCI5WW,,0.0

We hadn't gotten together in a very long time.  The trip up was very scenic and beautiful.  I drove up with my sister.  When we arrived everyone else was already there.  My sister in law had a beautiful table set with meats, cheeses and wine.  It was surprising to me that we all seemed to pick up where we left off, so to speak.  We hadn't seen each other in a long time and it felt like yesterday.   I was shocked to see how my brother's two sons had grown so much!  They are now mature young, handsome men with great personalities.  What a joy they were to interact with!  We had planned to go on a little trip to do some wine tasting, so we did that.  We had to take two cars.  The city we went to was Woodinville.  It is a quaint little town with tons of wineries to visit.  We were a big group, so we went to wineries that could accommodate all of us.  The tasting was very enjoyable with good wine and lots of conversation.  After that, we investigated online where we should go out to dinner.  We found a well reviewed Italian restaurant and decided to go to it.  The ambiance was nice and we were very pleased.  Unfortunately, the reviews were terribly wrong!  The food was horrible and the service worse.  Oh well, we made the best of it.  My sister and I spent the night and left early in the morning.  It was a memorable time for all of us.",3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L5I2W5R,3GFK2QRXXA37L5IRTQYMPH4L5I2W5R,0.0

We have many people who write to us to either share their own experiences surrounding this mystery, which is known as the crystal skulls, or ask us questions.  About six months ago, a friend who also has her own crystal skulls asked me for advice and called me.  She felt it was time to create the next public conference where people could meet the most well known crystal skull teaches and investigators in the world and I said it sounded like a good idea. I have personally been invited to speak at various crystal skull conferences over the years as well as have helped to organize a few of these. Thus, my friend decided to create such a conference near Chicago and invited me to be one of the speakers.  This conference will take place later this current month. I was very thrilled and honored to be invited as I have been involved in investigating the crystal skulls for over 35 years and I have so much amazing information and insights to share about these mysterious objects.  However, it is in my nature to offer to help create such a conference as there are keys aspects  I have learned about how to incorporate in such an event that could enhance the experience of the attendees.  So the memorable event to  be shared in this essay is the phone call I had with my friend, who became the conference coordinator who rejected my participation to help and desired to do it on her own.  She explained that for her, in her past when she has worked with a group, things have not worked out well and wanted to make sure that the visions she had for the conference would be created.  This was of course a great disappointment for me and it took away my enthusiasm to be a part of the conference.  Over the months as the conference was being announced publicly I would offer to help and share it with others we know via emails and social media but in my heart, I knew this event would miss some key activities to really share about the crystal skulls.  I will just have to wait my time in the future, when we can put together the proper resources to create our own event which I believe will delight all those who attended and expand their knowledge about this mysterious objects.  For now, when the conference happens I will do the most memorable talk I can do as well as share with those who attend the special crystal skulls we personally have.",3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PQ0EGD4,3GLB5JMZFYH6SW7KTRCN1Q6PQ0EGD4,0.0

I was so excited that he was able to go and be able to work on getting his degree. It was hard to have him just sit around and not have anything to do, like his peers who had gone straight to college from graduating. The school is close by and his schedule has fluctuated a lot, but its been worth it in the end. He eventually hopes to be an architect and I am so proud of what he's done so far. Its interesting to hear what he does in class or the different requirements he has to meet. I was shocked to see how the cost of college has changed. Since I was in school it has doubled in price. I don't think you are getting more value for the price and its slightly outrageous how much just community college costs. I can't imagine what it would be like to go to a four year college. I don't know how some parents are able to afford it. With his talent and ability its worth it and all I can say is how proud of him I am. And I will support him throughout school and after when he moves on to finding a job. He hasn't tried looking for a job just to have some extra money or to support himself while in school but I think he might also do that soon. It would be nice if he is able to get hired at an architectural firm, even as an intern so he can learn the aspects of the job.",3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88GANTMC,3GM6G9ZBKOJD1VZ3QKAXJZ88GANTMC,0.0

Studying architecture was definitely harder than i had thought. So much calculations. Units. The artistic element seems to be missing in our colleges these days. However, i was thrilled after graduation. I applied to all the major firms in the state for an opening position. No responses for a few months. I was getting downhearted.

Being a pizza delivery driver was one of the longest jobs I had ever held and it was a pretty relaxed job once I stopped stressing over how late the delivery may or may not be. When I told my father he was surprised asking me every few days, ""you're not scared?"" I honestly wasn't, I guess at the time I was more concerned about having enough money to last me during the schooling phase. So February after earning enough money to last me roughly two weeks (which by the way was a lot less than what I actually needed) I got on the greyhound to earn my place in this world. I had studied and earned my CLP (commercial learner's permit) while I did the odd jobs to get the money I needed for the trip. I arrived at night in a completely different hotel than was told I would be in and that frazzled me immediately. With literally no information about where I go next and when I decided to just go to sleep early and get on with it. Fast forward to the beginning of week two. This is where the fear sets in. The fear my father kept asking me if I felt 3 months ago had finally latched onto my heart and head. It was time to actually turn on and drive the truck to do my first backing maneuver. The first maneuver was actually pretty simple, just drive forward and back up.  Well it SOUNDS simple but it really isn't; the back of that 53 foot trailer wants to go in directions you didn't give it permission to go in. You had to learn to control the trailer and make sure it stays straight and doesn't continue to offtrack right or left. Eventually I got it down even though I genuinely felt I wasn't going to be able to do it. Then came the next maneuver which was offset parking. Take your trailer and move it to the very next spot. This took some time but eventually I got it after again thinking I wouldn't be able to do it. Then the next maneuver, parallel parking. Just thinking about parallel parking a truck still frazzles me to this day, but eventually I nailed it in five minutes, or so I thought. After practicing all three maneuvers till I got sick of them came test day. In my first station I had nailed all three maneuvers after much practice perfectly. In the last practice station I had trouble with parallel but ended up doing a prefect parallel right before I tested. Because my results had been inconsistent I wasn't exactly sure how I would test but long story short I ended up failing the parallel my first try during the test. I felt so defeated and extremely sad but I wasn't going to let it stop me considering I hated the thought of going back home with mom and dad. In forty eight hours I gave it another try and nailed it being one of three out of twenty four other students in my group able to get my CDL in three weeks",3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZ9A1Q5B,3GNA64GUZFQ218M5HHZGXSMZ9A1Q5B,0.0

We had the grand idea of making it a ""super fun road trip""... you know, for the memories. We got memories, alright. After loading the car down, we discovered a flat. We had to unpack the entire car to get to our spare, and change the tire. That's okay though! Just a flat. We've got this! On the road in just a little under an hour. The boys started squabbling almost immediately, which we expected. I was prepared! I had snacks and activities to distract them!Note to future self - Car rides and cheese cubes are not always a great combo. We had to make a pit stop to clean cheese cube vomit off of our little cherubs, and the entire backseat. That's okay though! Just a little cleaning. Back on the road in just 45 minutes. An hour later, we heard a thumping. What's that? Another flat? Since we just dealt with this earlier, our only spare was gone. Being the rocket scientists that we are, we unpacked the entire car before realizing this.  We called AAA, but since we were in the middle of nowhere, it took forever for them to get there. The snacks, gone... The car, stinky... The boys, frustrated... The mom, regretting all her choices... The dad, total dad mode of trying to rally the troops and get this done.

It was with my recent ex, and it was because she was cheating on me. I didn't suspect her at first, but little things built up over time that made it impossible to ignore. For instance, she wouldn't be as affectionate with me as she used to be at the start of our relationship. I could understand if she was cranky a few times a week and didn't want anyone hoovering over her or touching her, but this attitude of her towards me became a daily occurrence. What finally broke the dam for me was when she and I got into it when I tried to talk with her. She got angry and bitchy with me, saying that she didn't want to. I dropped it despite being so frustrated. Later that night, I woke out to go to the bathroom and saw he on the couch in the living room giggling like a school girl while on he phone. This sudden and rapid shift in mood was striking, so I asked he who she was on the phone with. I obviously caught her by surprise, and she tried to switch the conversation and hide her phone. I didn't  fall for her distractions and asked again who she was on the phone with, but that just gone her mad. She yelled at me and stormed out of the apartment. To next day, I got a call from her say we were through. I demanded her to tell me why, and she said she was hooking back up with her ex. I suspect that was who she was on the phone with the night before, and it would also explain her change in attitude towards me the weeks leading up to this. Sad that it ended the way that it did, but I'd rather it end quickly than to be in a miserable relationship.",,3GS6S824SRJBBUOXXQU8JY47YSCNWY,0.0

We would go up north to the small town where my dad grew up and watch the parade. Then we would grill out all day before watching fireworks at night. As an only child with just my parents, this wasn't exactly the most exciting time of my life. To put it bluntly, I was downright bored. So bored that I even tried to make some friends in that small town, to no avail. I swear I've been complaining about this routine trip to my parents for years, but two months ago they actually listened. Instead of the usual trip with us three, we would be joined by the entirety of my mom's side of the family. That meant a total of ten cousins, including six which are around my age. It was awesome! Instead of sitting in a chair watching dad flip burgers and mom stir potato salad, I was playing tackle football with my cousins in the field. Even the fireworks were more fun as everyone reacted loudly to their favorite style of firework. Overall it felt like a totally different vacation, and it surprised me that I could have so much fun in a place where I am usually bored stiff.

I am writing about this because I consider it a emotional and changing time in my life. As children grow older, it becomes increasingly difficult to let them go and do things on their own. My son turning 13 has been hard on me because I will always see him as my baby. He is still in a way very much that sweet little boy that he has always been. However, he is growing more and more each day and I can only hope and pray he grows into a good young man. We are very close and I pray it stays that way. He does have autism so he’s a little bit behind for his age. I just hope and pray that it does not affect his life tremendously in the long run. Sometimes, I think because of this disability he is a little more emotionally dependent than most 13-year-olds. As his mother , I will always be right here of course for him to be able to depend on. I do want him to grow though and be able to do things on his own as well. I guess it is just hard when your babies grow up to be teenagers and one day adults. I imagine this is a difficult emotional experience for all parents. I just feel extra attached because he is my first child and it feels especially hard to watch him grow up and become a man.",3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HQYNREP,3H0W84IWBLO29SUY5XHJ6C2HQYNREP,0.0

Most years the vacation is a real grind. We have been going to the same place for twenty years with the exception of two years. The truth is for a couple of years I have been trying to back out of it and do something on my own with my vacation time but my mom can do one hell of a passive aggressive guilt trip to get me to go. My parent will ask me and my siblings what we want to do new this year at the destination but the truth is as far as activities go we've gone scorched earth over this place. Anyway, My dad and older sister normally have the trip scheduled down to the minute, leaving no room for anybody else to have much input. I am a little ashamed to admit for the past few years I've spent most of my time in varying degrees of drunken stupor as my main form of entertainment.  I had thought this might be the year that the cycle would break but my sister, who definitely drives the engine in this scenario, came up with a scenario to take my brother's children along this year. I have to admit, this was not her worst idea. My brother had moved to a different city and these children had never been to the destination before and would definitely shake up the routine. So, that was what happened a couple of month's ago my brother brought his children to town and we packed them into the cars a few days later for the trip. The car ride down was mostly unmemorable except for the fact that I realized that my spotify  playlists were not really kid friendly. The trip itself was a lot of the same things as before but there was a new energy because it was it was new to the children and it was exciting for them to go someplace that they had never been before. Things that had been stale were given new life and people were forced to change up some of their routines. Doing things that had become pedestrian and had lost their luster became fun again as I watched my nieces do them and remembered how I used to love to do these things when I was younger. For some reason I was dominating games that required coordination. Actually, one of the biggest problems was as the week progressed was that time was becoming compressed and there was so much to do. These kids had heard about the different things, those of us who had been coming for years had done, and wanted to do it all. Our last night there we were doing things until one in the morning. The next morning when we left was the first time in a couple years I had felt the least bit sad to be leaving. It was a long drive home I think most people were a little frayed but it had been a good trip.",,3GU1KF0O4JNJQC2ZIEB409WHMHLPBQ,0.0

In order to get this position I went directly to the department manager and asked for an interview. I felt that this was a bold move but I was tired of where I was in the company. I wasn’t being paid for my degree and I knew there was no opportunity to move up. I was very nervous and scared to be disappointed or let down with myself. I had to go through several different interviews, with COO, CFO and the manager. This drug on for weeks not knowing if this was going to work out. I had already planned many things in my mind for my family and was thinking how well this would benefit us in the long run .I am so glad that everything worked out and despite the fact that it was stressful, I am very proud of myself. Going forward, I am planning on taking more chances and risks for my family and being more confident that good things happen when you take risks.

I had been suffering from anxiety and depression for a really long time, and I had been suffering in silence. The first day of therapy I realized this was something that I had been needing for a long time. It wasn't until our third or fourth session that more memories started coming to the surface. These memories had been repressed for quite some time and I finally felt like I had somebody to talk to about them to. I didn't feel any judgement, there was no eye roll or glaring. There was no, ""that was a long time ago, get over it"". I was able to just speak the words as they came to me. I'll never forget that experience. Once I finally began to breathe deeply again she told me how proud she was that I was able to share all of those things with her. I really recommend therapy for anybody that has things on their mind that they feel they need to keep to themselves. The session is all about you and they won't make you feel like you are a burden for taking the time to speak to them. You don't have to worry about them discussing your personal matters with friends or family that could come back to bite you. Your information that you share is private and at the same time you're sharing it with an actual person. I remember feeling a massive amount of relief that I had discussed my life so thoroughly and was made to feel normal afterwards. Any other time I've touched on past issues with friends or family, I didn't feel relief, I felt annoying and like I was  dragging them down. The therapy session I had at week three or four is exactly what I had been needing for years. I will never forget that experience. I felt ten pounds lighter at least, and any time those memories surfaced and started to affect me I would just remember everything that was said to me during the session.

I have never planned a surprise birthday before so I was very exciting about it. I knew my mother-in-law would not be expecting a surprise party so that made it even better. I called some of her close relatives who lived out of town to plan to be down for her birthday weekend. I reserved a private room at a restaurant that we frequent often so she would think we were just going out to dinner for her birthday. I went to the restaurant about a half hour before I knew my mother-in-law would be there and I decorated the tables with frames with picture of her over the years and I had a special cake made for her. It ended up being an amazing night because when my in-laws arrived at the restaurant my mother-in-law was so surprised to see her sister and her nieces there and was thrilled that we surprised her. It was so much fun. She appreciated it so much to have all her family there. The whole weekend ended up being fantastic. My mother-in-law usually is the one who plans everything. She is not used to having someone do all the planning and her not knowing anything about it. My husband and I bought her this amazing digital frame that anyone she invites can send pictures to it. It was a gift she never expected. I managed to find a lot of old family photos of hers and had them uploaded on the frame so she would be excited to see them.,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN4FGWA,3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAN4FGWA,0.0

We both had wanted a small private wedding.  Something that was not expensive.  I knew that my wife had a fascination about waterfalls.  I had taken her to see several waterfalls since we had began dating, all of which she thoroughly enjoyed.  I therefore decided to book our wedding in Gatlinburg, Tennessee by a small waterfall.  I booked the date and had everything set up.  It was just going to be my wife, the preacher, a photographer, and myself.  The whole experience did not cost much at all.  When you plan an outdoor activity in advance, you risk facing adverse weather.  As the wedding day approached I kept looking at the weather report and was worried as it had a very high chance of raining that day.  On the day of our wedding, I woke up to the sound of pouring rain.  I looked outside, and it was indeed raining and cloudy as far as I could see.  I was smart enough to have made alternate arrangements just in case, but I knew my wife was really wanting the wedding to be by the waterfall.  The wedding wasn't scheduled until 2 pm.  My now wife and I began to get dressed and ready for the wedding with both of us hoping the weather would magically change.  I heard it stop raining around 1 pm.  I quickly looked outside and I saw a blue patch in the sky, but I also saw plenty of dark clouds right behind it.  MY wife and I headed to where the ceremony was going to be, all the while both of us praying that the rain would hold up just long enough.  To our surprise, it still was not raining again once we got to the waterfall.  We were excited and blessed.  We had a 10 minute, beautiful intimate wedding but the waterfall where rays of sunshine were beaming on us.  Fifteen minutes after we got married, it once again began to downpour.  We were amazed and blessed by our luck in the weather.",3H7XDTSHKDD5127BAMHDTEVAVRGGWT,,0.0

My family finally talk me in to financing my first car. I mean if I am going to throw a few thousand towards fixing a transmission I might as well get a new car, it made sense. I go to the dealer ship with the car I had in mind I'd want to finance. The car was sitting on the lot, I was excited, my first ever financed car. I go for a test drive, everything seemed to be perfect. I get the car home after what seemed like an eternity, filling out paper work. I'm excited, I call my friends and we go for a drive to show off my new financed car. It was everything I wanted and more. I figured since this car was new I would not have anymore problems as far as transportation was concerned. Then I get the call that struck my heart in a sad way. I get a call from the dealership telling me he canceled my contract and I must return this car immediately! Turns out, he canceled my contract because he was a crooked dealer who lied to the bank about my income. I was hurt by this. I returned the car and ended up having to refinance a car that was not of my choice and impacted my credit score. Not only has it impacted my credit score but my payments I was making before the refinancing was a lot less than what I am paying now.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZYNPLC,0.0

This, unfortunately, has led to me experiencing relatively frequent panic attacks. A few weeks ago I had what I would call my most costly panic attack ever. I had been feeling under the weather around that time and it didn't seem like I was getting any better. I had already been to the doctor twice in two weeks, but the doctor told me that all of the tests came back negative for any of the likely causes. He said that it was likely just a cold that has been aggravated by stress and that it would resolve itself with time. I woke up one morning and felt worse than I have ever felt. This caused me to get my self very wound up and have another panic attack. Once I was able to gather myself, I drove myself to the emergency room. The doctor there conducted all of the basic tests and still nothing was out of the ordinary. Being panicked, I  insisted that something was wrong and asked if there were any other tests that they could run. The doctor said yes, but also informed me that my insurance would likely not cover the costs of the additional tests. Being so anxious and upset, I agreed to still have the tests, even though my savings weren't anything special. So they ran a few additional tests and everything still came back negative. I eventually was convinced to go home and once again, wait and see if things got better. Of course, within a few days I was feeling as good as new. I was incredibly relieved until I received my medical bills. It would wipe out all of my savings and force me to use a payment plan to cover all of my expenses.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM9UFPL6,0.0

He refers to it as a collaboration which boosted my confidence in matters of design and construction.  At the same time, I noticed that I was starting to be more observant all around me.  I started cleaning out other areas of the house and paying more attention to myself.  I suddenly had more energy to go to exercise classes, and even started polishing my nails.  I painted the front of my house and hung new house numbers.  I put plants inside and outside the house.  I am using my Turk money to buy things for the house to refresh the decor, etc.  I was acting as if I had come out of a deep sleep.  I don't think I was depressed but maybe had fallen into a complacent lifestyle.  I had energy for other people and things but had not really directed it toward my living environment.

My house is so old but was a great buy because it was advertised as a ""fixer-upper"". After the first couple of years it didn't seem like it was such a great buy after all. I invested a lot of time and money in working on it but I finally ran out of both. The bathroom was the biggest embarrassment and definitely had an impact on my social activities. As far as I was concerned the loose tiles, mildew stained walls and ancient sink, commode and bathtub was something I could live with but after a humiliating experience with a friend who dropped me off after a lunch date and asked to use the bathroom, a re-model soared right up to the top of the to-do list. She opened the door, walked inside, turned around and came back out immediately announcing that she didn't have to ""go after all"" and left. I refused to have anyone over and as a result, invitations to friend's houses came less and less frequently. I even overheard two friends say they wondered why I always came to their houses but never ""returned the favor"". The re-model was costly but the transformation was amazing. My bathroom looks like something from House Beautiful. The new fixtures, wall coverings, shower enclosure and lighting are incredible. I'm back on the ""social scene"" after a few get-together's and my self-confidence is back. It's so true that one's home tells so much about who you are. Now that I'm proud of my surroundings I feel like that's just the beginning of endless possibilities.",,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSM00UPLO,0.0

Our anniversary is tomorrow and we're going on a fabulous date of dinner around Newport Harbor. As I reflect back, I think to how nervous I was to even ask her to marry me. I bought the ring five months before I actually asked her. I practiced what I would say for months and just couldn't work up the nerve. Finally, after all that, I popped the question. I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. And she said yes! She actually said yes, the most beautiful woman in the world agreed to marry me, some schmuck from Brooklyn. We got married just one month later and the most beautiful service ever. We were married at the Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas. Everyone was there, our parents, our friends and even Elvis made an apppearance! We stayed the Mirage just up the street and just had the most wonderful time.

Overall i was happy for it because well it was something fun? who would not enjoy something that is a fun and good time out with people.  i was looking forward to this since then and planned many since then. As nights out are not something that can be done daily. As fun as that could be but overall it is a highlight for me. Like so many things can be mundane. And not be what you really want them to be when you go out. its good that something at least is what it should be nothing more nothing less. Which since the time of the event i have done it a couple more times. And i plan to go again somewhere else again as drinking and kicking the bucket with friends with a band playing awesome music. Is some of the best moments i have had though that night was in paticular better. Because the bands that played killed it so hard. They were heavy hard and just ripped through their sets. Plus their were so many of them which was a good turn around.,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,,0.0

As i decided to go out and have a fun time at night. Grabbing a few drinks and seeing a show which is something i do not get to do all the time. But this time i had gotten the chance to do something like that. The first part was sort of grating though to me. The act of getting ready which can take some time. which some people seem to find fun? I do not because it is just something i wish could be just over with. But alas it is needed to get towards the main event and just go with it. But well it could be much worse than it already is. So i go out and it is just a long night which is good as this is supposed to be a good night which by all accounts it was. And i will say it is but i did have a bit to drink and the show was just a heck of  a time. Totally destroying their set and the two step was hardcore.  overall the bands were great and the feel was awesome. The drinks tasted sublime as well overall a great night out partying.,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,3H7Z272LX8TV3LOB9R0YECSMZZEPL5,0.0

Little did we know, that party caused something to happen to my sister. Next day at 8PM, my sister hung herself. This was the most tragic event of my life, I never imagined my life without her but shit. She was 5 years older than me and she helped me with EVERYTHING in my life. She helped me with my math problems and tell me about her life. We had so much fun together. I just with I knew that my time with her was limited because that would've caused me to live my life even better while I was with her. Life took a bad turn after I lost her.

The result was a five day hospital stay and then a nineteen day stay at a step down facility. I stayed with her during this entire time. I only left to get something to eat or purchase items that she wanted. Nobody was allowed to visit from home because she was contagious. So it was just her and I for the duration. It was during this time that I had a personal awakening. The week before all of this happened I had been to the doctor myself for my first visit in over two years. Some health issues were discovered that I had not been paying attention to. My sister died two years ago after a short hard fight against a very aggressive cancer. After this I just didn't care about taking care of myself anymore. So while I was with Mom it finally clicked what I needed to do for me. So during this time I began to exercise everyday. By the end of her stay I felt better, had so much more energy and felt better mentally. I have been trying to continue this since she came home. Now I feel like I am winning again.",3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO7QZGQP,3HFNH7HEMI00H5BPYDI71PDO7QZGQP,0.0

Im feeling all kinds of emotions I have always been a daddys girl. Even at times when i didn't want to be. My earliest memory of my dad is me dancing in my room while he played the air guitar. I think I was about 4 years old. I remember thinking he was the coolest guy alive. I remember the first time he hit me for no reason i was 10. He was mad at something I cant remember what but he picked me up and threw me into the tv. I really remember feeling pain i just remember my head feeling numb almost like white noise. I cried thinking it had to be my fault I was gonna be better. But I never did get better and things got worse. My father was addicted to drugs I knew that I think it was something everybody knew. I had tried over the years to get him clean. Nothing worked i began to hate him blaming him for everything that happened bad in my life.  I looked at his body in the casket i kissed his cheek he was cold. Almost as cold as our relationship had been while i was growing up. I felt a since of loss for our relationship that could of been I felt guilt for not forgiving him.,3HMIGG0U4MSUXSWT6PNDMYZS9SV8YB,,0.0

I've received the best gift life could ever give me in the form of my beautiful baby boy, Mateo. I still remember how lost and scared I felt when the pregnancy test I took came up positive. I just stood there thinking, ""I always wanted to be a mother, but am I really ready for all of this? I know it's selfish to feel this way, but it's not going to be all about me anymore."" I was so scared that I even contemplated giving him up for an adoption early on in the pregnancy, but that all changed once I had my first ultrasound. Three months ago....one bright and early Thursday morning...I began to feel strong contractions and instantly knew Mateo was ready to make his entrance into this world. I quickly called out to my sister and told her it was time. The trip to the hospital was a blur, I kind of felt like I was in a trance...almost losing my grip on reality. I finally came to once I was on the hospital bed and getting ready to push. The pain was so intense and again the doubtful thoughts began to come to my mind, ""Are you really ready for this? Are you really ready to be a mother and handle all that comes with it?"" Before more questions could continue racing through my mind, my body instantly took over and I felt a sudden urge to push. I pushed and pushed for what seemed like an eternity and boy was it painful! I felt so tired and thought I couldn't push anymore until the nurse yelled out, ""Keep going! His head is right there!"" I pushed with the last bit of energy I had left in me and Mateo made his grand entrance. The nurse placed him in my arms and....I know it's so cliche to say, but I instantly fell in love with him. Three months ago, I became a mother for the very first time to the most beautiful human being in this world and I am so grateful for that. I still have days where I wake up to self-doubting thoughts.

There would be spoons that would just fly out of our cereal. There would be ghosts in the mirror. Glass would just suddenly crack. Black cats would just start talking to us.

While there, I indicated that he was having issues breathing, that he got out of breath quickly. The doctor hesitated but decided to do a breathing test. This test involved walking on a treadmill while his breathing was being monitored by machines. We thought, ok, not a real big problem. In the days leading up to the testing we decided to do a bit of spring cleaning. We started cleaning our carpets but were not finished the day of the test. While doing the test the nurses were alarmed, canceled the remainder of the test and told us that my husband was NOT to do any more carpet cleaning or anything to exert himself. This caused alarms to us. We went to see the heart doctor who directed us to a heart surgeon. She immediately admitted my husband to the hospital for a quadruple heart bypass. This was a critical day for both of us, not knowing his chances of making it through the surgery or how life would be after surgery. I had to learn how to do the outdoor tasks that usually fall on the man of the house. I learned how to drive the tractor to cut the grass, and the worst of all was learning how to operate the snowblower to clear the sidewalks and driveways. I had to do all household activities for 6 months, however in the end I still had the love of my life and we continue to enjoy life together. Now we take long walks when we want, take naps when we feel we must and enjoy an occasional pizza together.",3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,0.0

Many years ago a girl opened her heart to me, she told me things she said she had never told another soul, she felt that she could trust me more so than any other person in her life. She meant the world to me, my whole soul lit up the moment she entered the room.  I felt myself really falling for her personality, her smile, her laugh. I was very honored that we were able to share time together, it really meant something to me and I hope that it had meant a lot to her as well.  When she told me that she was moving cross country, I was heart-broken. I truly thought that she would be in my life forever and yet that was not the case at all.  She had been assigned to a job which would take her away from me and possibly to new countries and new adventures. I might never see her again and I felt that was almost too much for me to bear. We did keep in touch, and like I suspected, contact became less and less until it was almost gone completely. I went on with my life, found other people to spend my time with. Dated, and dated some wonderful people, but none really compared to her. I found she was on my mind, if only in the back of my mind as the gold standard to which anyone I met was compared against. It was definitely difficult to compare and my relationships always suffered as a consequence of it. Then one day, just last week my life changed forever. I heard it first, that magical laugh that always captivated me. I had to seek the source of the sound. Although many years had passed, I could remember it like it was yesterday and so many feelings came flooding back.  When I turned around I discovered it was her - it was really her! She was standing there a huge smile on her lips. It look me by surprise I never thought I would see her again and yet there was was standing before me. We talked for hours as though we had never been apart. To find out that she is moving back to our town, that she is single and still thinks of me as I had thought of her is almost a stroke of magic. I look forward to the years to come and hope they are just as magical as the very first day I laid eyes upon her.",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK6ZSY1L,0.0

It started a few months before that, when he complained about how much his chest hurt when he would exercise. I just chalked it up to him getting older, and joked with him that that's what happens when you're an old man, trying to run with the young boys. I remember the 1st time I noticed it, it was 7 months ago. He had just come back from playing basketball. I laid on his chest and could feel his heart beating insanely quick; I'm talking about it sounding like a ""drum roll please"" quick beat. I brought it to his attention but he just brushed it off as having a harder game today than usual. Things started going downhill quickly after that. 2 weeks later, he could barely walk up the stairs without being out of breath. I told him he needs to go to the hospital, the ER or something so they can at least listen to his heart with a stethoscope. He still refused, tried to pretend like nothing was out of the ordinary. Then, one day, he was so out of breath coming up the stairs, he passed out and ended up spraining his wrist. Thankfully he finally went to the hospital, and they examined his heart. Laying in the hospital bed, his breath suddenly became super heavy and labored, and one of the machines started making this really loud beeping noise. Doctors came rushing in, they ended up having to usher me out; they had to a CT scan/MRI on him. They found that he had 3 damaged heart valves, and because of that, his heart wasn't able to get enough of his oxygen in his blood to his lungs and every subsequent problem. He had to have emergency heart surgery. Recovery was expected to take 6 months, with very light exercise after 3 months. Only 2 more months left until he's fully recovered. Always listen to your body, it knows you best.",,3HMVI3QICKECMSC874EY7OCK4A81YO,0.0

My baby's leaving the nest. So many mixed feelings! The thing I'm focusing on right now is remembering her high school graduation. It was 4 months ago but, Diary, it feels like a lifetime ago! I remember every little detail just like it was yesterday, though! When we heard Kim was valedictorian, we were so proud we thought we'd burst! Our little girl, giving the valedictorian speech! Believe it or not, I actually shook from excitement while I was helping her into her gown. Before I knew it, we drove into the school parking lot and were making our way to the field. Both hubby and I couldn't resist giving her one last hug before she took her place with the other graduates. Her speech was amazing. She's always been an awesome writer, and her words inspired the crowd so much they jumped to their feet for a very loud, and very unexpected, standing ovation!

They had invited us, but my husband and I didn't know if we would be able to make it. My husband had been feeling ill since the start of the year, but he convinced me it was important to go. We decided to drive instead of flying, and the excuse was to see friends we hadn't seen in decades. When we got there, we saw so many faces of people we were so close to ages ago. Then, something just hit us, and it felt like we were in our 20's again! The music started playing, people stopped talking and hit the dance floor. I hadn't seen my husband move like that since our wedding night (August 4th of 1972)! Maybe it was the alcohol, but he seemed to be having such a great time, it was almost too good to be true! The DJ was playing the best 70's music, he food was fantastic, and it felt like I had been transported back to the golden years. When all was said and done, I profusely thanked my best friend, and my husband and I danced our way back to the hotel, without any music. I hadn't felt this way in years, what a wonderful feeling. I went to bed worried that we would feel the effects of the party the next day, but we woke up with springs in our step. All was wonderful. I can't wait until my friend hosts another party like that, we'll definitely make it a priority to attend it again!",,3HQUKB7LNG01487XZTDVDBXO6MWHHM,0.0

She received a call that he had been found in his cell unconscious. She traveled over there and he never really did regain full faculties. The state released him to her and she had him transported over here to our state so she could take care of him. He lasted around 6 months before his body systems failed him. We buried him in the local cemetery. It was a very sad occassion to have to bury such a young man under such horrible circumstances. We have concated an attorney in the state of Florida. He is looking it finding any video or eye witness to what could have happened. The guards nor the prison are forthright at all. I know she needs these questions answered. When you lose one of 2 children in such a manner you need answers. I have my doubts though that she will find answers. She still does not know exactly what happened in that jail cell and probably never will. The questions and guilt must be enormous but at least he is not suffering anymore.,3HUTX6F6VV97HZQ2KL5EAGON957O2Q,,0.0

We first landed in Ireland and it was the most amazing thing ever. We met many different people from around the world at our hostel. We got to explore Dublin and got to taste amazing food that the city had to offer.  After Ireland we took the ferry and headed towards London. We got see many historical landmarks and fully  took in the culture tasting food native to London. Then next city was Amsterdam. The art and culture that this city had to offer was breathtaking. The architecture was interesting and the bike culture pulled me in even more. We rode around the city and relaxed by the river side during the night.  Next stop was Switzerland. Once I got here I just didn't to leave at all. The natural landscape was absolutely breathtaking. My friends and I journey through this hiking trail that took us about 7 hours to complete but it was so worth it. We met alot of friendly people along the way and got to see the astonishing views that will forever be with us that we saw during the hike.

He mentioned the friend in casual conversation after I had asked him several times to no longer talk about him. This caused a serious argument between us, during which he accused me of ""going off the deep end"". He used my mental health issues (anxiety and depression) as ammunition in this argument. His use of my mental health to support his position really hurt my feelings for several reasons. The most important of those reasons being that he and I had begun sharing our mental health issues with each other. Our issues had not been something we have been able to really discuss in the past. I thought we had reached a point where I would be able to share things with him and we could understand each other in that way. The ""friend"" in question never really did anything serious enough to me to warrant getting the law involved, but it had bothered me for several years. In years past, my father was aware of the issues and stopped being friends with the person in question. I am not sure why he suddenly decided that what the ""friend"" did wasn't an issue anymore. It really hurt my feelings that he seemed to have decided that my feelings were no longer important. He claimed I should get over it because it had been several years since the incidents happened. I tried to explain to him that I was mostly over the past incidents, but it was difficult to not think about him when the person in question was brought up on a regular basis. This didn't really seem to matter to him. Instead, he was more interested in doing whatever he could to not think about this problem. I am still not sure how our relationship will be fixed, even after all this time.",3HVVDCPGTFEDVCOH9NY8DUVFWTOTYE,,0.0

I'm a stay at home mom. My husband works a lot to provide for our family and we haven't been able to go on vacation until a couple of months ago. We decided to go to the beach because our toddler have never seen the ocean and we used to go to the beach every year before we had our son. We went in May and the water was super cold still but we had so much fun running away from the waves and playing in sand. Our son was so mesmerized by the ocean. He kept calling it Big Water. The waves were pretty big the first day. One time he felt brave enough to run into the water without holding my hand and when he saw a big wave coming his way he didn't have enough time running away from it and it got him! He didn't cry but he kept telling us: ""Big water got me!"" It was so funny. Oh, We even saw some dolphins! It was quite special. We also spent a day with our friends who recently moved to Virginia beach. We went to this very small family owned restaurant together and it was truly a hidden gem! It doesn't look good from the outside but when you're inside you can feel this nice, friendly vibe. The food was also so delicious and they have THE BEST home made brownies I've ever had in my life! It was our very first vacation as a family of three and i will always remember it with a smile.",3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5B42UPQ,3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5B42UPQ,0.0

I had earlier suggested we go on a trip to Hawaii. My husband did not take long before he agreed that the idea is clever. I have always watched the Hawaiian beaches on TV and the good apartment and condos with beach view. I have always wanted to visit Hawaii. The week we were to travel, I went shopping. I selected vintage wear for my boy and my husband. I bought him a silky boxers and some vintage shirts for the beaches. I bought my son a nice cowboy hat to match his wears. Believe me when I say I was very excited about the idea of visiting Hawaii. The trip was a bit rough but the excitement of landing in Hawaii just filled my head that I didn't have time to think about the flight itself. We landed and rented a car at the airport to drive to our booked airbnb condo. It was just facing the beach (dream come true). The moment we reached, I just opened my box and started removing the dress for a beach wear. He was quite amused by my actions. I waited some more minutes for them to do their thing. He knew that time was not the time to ask to rest or sleep as I will completely disagree. We hit the beach after a 6-hour flight. Crazy!!! The water was cold but we had a nice time dodging the waves and playing the the beach sand. We spent 10 days in Hawaii before leaving for our state.",,3I02618YA1SYMBB5I5SZ5ZO5B42UPQ,0.0

He suffered multiple fractures in his shoulder.  It was my worst nightmare come true.   My husband has worked two jobs for as long as we were together.  We have had a lot of difficulties in our marriage.  It has only lasted for as long as it has because he was always working.  I have made my own life and was happy with how I had structured my life.  He has been out on worker’s compensation for over 3 months and it has changed my entire life or life, as I have lived it.  He has been home every day, for the first month in a sling.  He couldn’t do much of anything and he has tried my patience, to the extent that I can’t stand it or him.  After a month, he went to physical therapy, which left me even more frustrated.  He didn’t follow the therapist’s recommendations, to do exercises at home.  We would get into bitter feuds about it.  It reminded me of the early days of our marriage, where frustration ruled the day.  He refuses to listen to reason and I feel I have nowhere to turn, to get away from his craziness.  His behavior brings me back to very dark place. When he worked two jobs, I rarely saw him and that worked for me.  I try to take life, day by day, but its been so difficult for me.  I have realized that I have essentially been in this relationship by myself and that we literally have nothing, but our love of our dogs, in common.  It’s a really sad revelation but his being home, has all brought it to the forefront and is making me question my entire life.",,3HWRJOOET6OEA7UBKMHOWM7DNHLSE2,0.0

My stepmother took us to the beaches and her favorite restaurants while my dad had to work during the day.  One night, they surprised us with tickets to Disney World.  I had never been there before, so I was very excited to experience this with my kids.  It was hot out, but worth every second.  My children were so happy to see all of the characters and the castle that is always shown on television.  That last couple of days during our vacation, we visited other family members nearby.  Then we packed up and prepared to come home.  We missed my husband, who had to work and couldn't get the vacation time off.

When we got to my dad's house, we all had a big dinner and dessert. When we were done eating, I went around the table and gave each of them a ticket. My kids went crazy.

Getting my horse pregnant was a very tricky operation. She had a curved cervix so it took many tries before she finally tested positive. I moved her to a facility that solely dealt with equine reproduction. One day I was lucky enough to arrive at the facility just as she was giving birth. I was told by the people who run the place beforehand that most likely I wouldn't be able to be present because more often than not, horses give birth in the middle of the night. So it was some very good fortune that we arrived in time to experience it. When we got to the facility, I didn't see my horse. The thought even crossed my mind that she was stolen. But then I saw she was on the ground, in labor. The whole process was amazing. I had mixed feelings of excitement and concern for my horse. Horses can have breech births. This can sometimes can result in both the mother and foal dying. But I didn't need to be concerned. The birth was amazingly fast. My horse got on her feet immediately. She was very attentive to her foal. The best part for me was seeing the filly get to her feet. It was a bit of a struggle at first and she was very wobbly. Then she started nursing and everything seemed to be as it should.",3I3WADAZ9RQZGW9P247C8NRZ1DDO5A,,0.0

This was a blow to me since I had already gone through breast cancer six years ago. I am turned 50 this year, so being diagnosed with two kinds of cancer in six years was very emotional for me. I did not expect to have thyroid cancer as well. I imagined that the breast cancer was a fluke and that I would never get diagnosed with cancer again. I was a healthy person, this is what everyone told me. I went to the endocrinologist to follow up on some thyroid nodes and he saw something that looked ""weird"".  After he took the biopsy and they got the results, I was told I had to have a thyroidectomy. I had already had a mastectomy, a hysterectomy and now a thyroidectomy.. I was losing body parts quickly. In addition to this, on the morning of the surgery, I was walking to the car with my boyfriend and I tripped on the sidewalk outside of my home and fell and broke my wrist! I had to arrive at the hospital in horrible pain. It was not a very good experience. I was more worried about my arm than my thyroid surgery. I had the surgery and they ended up doing an x-ray in the recovery room as I was coming out of anesthesia! I was in pain the entire time I was in the hospital and I had to wait all day the next day for a doctor to tell me what to do about my wrist. After watching Jaws and Jaws II in my hospital bed, an orthopedic surgeon ran in and gave me my diagnosis. I finally got to go home, however, I now had another complication. I had a huge seroma on my neck from my surgery. It looked and felt terrible. It was a very large accumulation of fluid that would not go away for weeks. I felt like an injured bird. I was just so tired of medical testing and being cut up and stuck with needles. I was exhausted from being in so much pain. It was one memorable experience that I want to forget. I just want to be and stay healthy, and that is all I want from now on.",,3I2PTA7R3UG5JR78O43MZH5HFU0QKX,0.0

It was 6 am and I was immediately taken in an out of body experience which is all I can describe it as. I heard my son screaming for help and I immediately screamed for my wife because I thought I was going to find my daughter dead in her room. My son was crying over my daughter as she shook and her eyes were rolling in the back of her head. I was sure that she was choking on something and my son through tears kept telling me she may have swallowed a lego because they had been playing with them. I felt sick and told my wife to call the ambulance right away. We were screaming at each other and crying and I shoved my fingers in my daughters throat to try and get her airway clear because I was positive it was choking. I even started doing heart compresses. I thought she was going to be gone and I have never been more afraid. I felt myself outside of my body looking in at that moment. My son was terrified and I did not keep it together well for him. When the ambulance came my wife was sure it was a seizure by the way she was reacting after. She immediately fell asleep and we took her to the ER. She had to have an xray to confirm that there was nothing blocking her airways. It was the single most terrifying moment in my life. My daughter has epilepsy.,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQB420P4Y,,0.0

I called him by his name he was shocked that who can actually call him by this name, only his closed friends call him by this funny name, he looked and he tried to see who was calling him but he couldn't recognise me well enough because of my new look, beards and all. I went to meet him and i greeted him and after we both saw the movie we went out to talk about life and other things that has happened to us. We spoke about family, jobs, relationships and material possessions. The most amazing thing was that he now drives a Lamborghini aventador. I was so happy for him, he gave me his official card, he said i should email him with my resume. I mailed him with the resume immediately. He made a call and said ""don't worry you'll be paid three times your current wages"". We both laughed about it but he was serious, i saw it in his tone. Jokingly, I asked him when do i start?.he replied and said ""when i'm ready"". I said i'll have to quit my current job. We went to a restaurant not very far from the cinema. We ate and we left. He called me the second day that i've been offered a role in his firm. I was so delighted and happy about the news. I went to the company, he personally gave me a tour of the firm and made me welcomed. I was really surprised but it was overwhelming and i didn't know how what to say, than to say thank you my friend.",3IGI0VL648636LFV643Y24RLVQYON8,,0.0

We also went by some historical places around town. That was so cool to learn about the history of the area. It was all information I didn't know before and that was crazy. We also went to a large lake where there were a lot people hanging out and doing water sports. That was entertaining. They seemed cold and I didn't think they were having fun.

We booked a large ranch house on Airbnb for most of us.  Others either camped or found other places in the area.  This was special because my dad died young and this uncle helped raise me and my four sisters.  We came together from all over the country to meet up and honor him.  For four days we bonded and reminisced.  We caught up on each other's lives.  We met new members of the family.  We rejoiced in our good times and mourned the sad times.  The best thing was the love we all felt as we reconnected. A surprising event occurred when we were working on family history together.  A cousin's wife wanted me to search for her birth father.  He was last seen about 20 years ago.  He had a stroke and his niece got conservatorship from the court.  He was placed in a nursing home.,  For twenty years, nobody has seen or heard from him.  I searched genealogical records and it's as if he dropped off the face of the earth.  Since there are no death records, we suspect that he died many years ago and the niece has been collecting the automatically deposited monthly Social Security benefits.  She has contacted local police to investigate. Other than that the reunion was loving and emotional.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBDEXP4S,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBDEXP4S,0.0

For most fathers, I'm sure, this would be a momentous occasion in any regard.  However, for me, it was a miracle.  You see, I've been battling a myriad of cancers for almost nine years.  And, in April, my doctors informed me that they had done all the could and that I should enter hospice.  A week after this revelation, I accompanied my daughter, son-in-law to be, his mom, my elder daughter and her husband, to the park where they were to be married.  It was a beautiful, unseasonably mild and sunny, Spring day.  There was a small lake, with a beach where the ceremony was to take place.  My daughter wore her bridal veil as I walked her down the ""aisle"" of sand to the lake's edge.  A family Pastor shared some of his thoughts and prayers as I ""presented"" her to her beloved, tears in all of our eyes and immense joy in our hearts, for this moment.  Afterward, we went to their favorite restaurant, The Green Turtle, for a mock wedding luncheon.  Then, a few days later, as I prepared to leave for hospice, one of my doctors called.  They wanted to delay hospice and invited me to participate in an experimental regimen of new treatments.  By this time I had resolved that my life was ending and my soul was at peace.  My family said they would abide by whatever decision I chose.  In the end, I accepted the treatments.  They were profoundly invasive, painful...and miraculous.  For I was able to attend, and participate in, the actual events of June 18th, in all their glory and rejoice.  I'm now in partial remission and immensely thankful to be living, one day at a time.",3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP9P4P,3IHR8NYAM8NZ5DHQ3Z1HSVQBCP9P4P,0.0

It's gotten harder due to a lack of young players willing to commit. I started playing in 2005. During that time i have played for two teams and missed one season due to an army deployment. I have always remained committed and loyal to the team i am on. The part that is the worst is getting old. The game slows down and every last game of the season could be the last game forever. It's always emotional because i have played baseball since i was 5 years old. It's been a constant throughout my life. Now i spend time attempting to recruit players to make sure that we actually have enough guys to make it through the season. Last year was the worst team i've been a part of as we lost every game, most by blowout. That kind of record isnt really attractive for new players. I can only hope that the guys we had last year come back and continue to gain experience and grow. I know we had a solid core group of older guys who are the back bone of our team.

It's almost frustrating because it was so close to a perfect trip. The place was just beautiful. We've been to DisneyLand a handful of times and one of the things that always impressed me was how clean it was. Disney World definitely held that same quality of being almost unnaturally clean for a place that's mostly exterior and that the public has full access to. The rides were super fun though the wait was predictably long. And it's almost more about the atmosphere anyways than the rides. What's great is going to a spot and having a full scale experience of being in that place and part of that fictional universe. About getting as close to feeling like it's real as you possibly can. The Disney parks are so amazing for that. And it was such a neat thing to experience with my family. I'm glad we all got a chance to go and share it even with the new additions. I remember going to DisneyLand with my parents and two siblings when we were young and it was like, another level of awesome to go with my parents, my husband, my brother and his wife, and my sister, her husband and her daughter. Watching the family grow and then all still be able to come together and do something fun as a group is another level of special. I always appreciate when we get to do these big vacations. BUT THEN there was that one thing, just that one thing that made the trip less than perfect. I got food poisoning on the second night!  It just ended up being such a wretched evening and I was up all night trying to get it out of my system which meant I was exhausted the next day. Like, it's so frustrating to have that small imperfection mar such an amazing trip!",,3II4UPYCOKTX5L1YWNHZV4ARUYJQDP,0.0

The girl I met there, Julie, called today and asked how I was. I'm not exactly sure how to take it though given that she hadn't called before now. It's been ages since I got along with someone so well, and everything we had in common made night one for the ages, plus there was a wedding happening! I can't believe Jake managed to get Vulfpeck to play his wedding. That's Jake's style though, all class, and an absolute jazz fanatic. I can't believe how much they must have paid for that shindig between the band, and that incredibe spread from Chez Gus. That guy is a big time chef, I didn't even think he did catering, but Jake can be a persuasive mofo. I guess the Franklins can be too haha. I honestly can't remember the last time I've had such a completely satisfying experience. That sounds underwhelming, but it cover all the bases and that's the best way to describe it. All 5 senses were satiated, the conversation was inteligent yet casual, and Julie sure made the overnight memorable. I think I will try and stay in touch with her, at the least. Who knows, maybe her and I can recreate that night someday, only swap ourselves in as the happy couple. Or maybe we can just hang and bang. Either way, it ought to be fun!",,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09AIARIO,0.0

It's in a wooded area near his house and he talked about it quite a bit but until then I'd never seen it. When we got there the first thing that struck me was the sheer natural beauty of the waterfalls before me. Several cascades in succession flowed down the mountain before me. I was captivated by the scene. I'm not sure if I had ever seen anything in nature as beautiful as that. This was a very important place to my boyfriend. He often came here to think and dream and contemplate. He says the falls help him to center himself when he is not feeling right. The fact that he brought me there to share that place that is so special to him speaks volumes of his feelings for me. I felt very honored to be there.  I felt like my boyfriend and I reached an important milestone in our relationship that day. It made me feel so happy and hopeful and loved. I almost felt like we got married there that day. Now I love the waterfall and go there every chance I can.,,3IJXV6UZ1Y5EPXWK1G7ARR09IRURIY,0.0

I am finally writing this down because last week he got the news that he is going to be getting a new kidney. i am so relieved and i cannot even imagine the relief he feels. I feel like this is the first time i have been happy in months. i haven't minded taking him to the dialysis treatments or helping him out with any medication while this is going on, but thank god. every time we talked about it or scheduled an appointment it was a constant reminder of the threat to his life. i am honestly surprised that he was able to get lined up with a new kidney so fast. you hear on tv all the time how people wait years and end up dying on a waiting list. i am so thankful that this wasn't our experience. i don't even want to think about what it would have been like to watch my dad suffer like that. i feel so bad no for people that have to go through that.

We were almost going to make this happen but we changed our minds. My father was saying that he kept mentioning this waterpark near where he lives in Washington. This is near Seattle. He said that it would be a great place to take him because he loves water parks but had never actually been to one. Also, some of my sons friends live there and they would love to celebrate with him. We thought about it long and hard and decided to do it. It was also financially easier for us as well.

My job was to walk and play with the dogs.  Sometimes I would also go to the cat and kitten building and play with the cats.  It was a rewarding experience.  I loved bring a little joy and comfort to all the animals.  It also brought joy to me and helped me with my depression.  The unexpected thing that came about was that I really got attached to one particular dog and adopted her a month ago.  It was the best decision of my life.  She brings me so much happiness.  I will never regret spending my spare time with these pets.  I often take Pippen to the shelter to interact with some of the dogs.  It is so sweet when she recognizes some of the dogs that are still there. Adopting Pippen has been so emotionally good for me and my family.  I post online picture from the shelter.  I would encourage everyone I know to do the same.,,3IQ1VMJRYU6TFFH0VBFBJ8CWAJAA90,0.0

I was working at a hospital on the west coast—specifically, on the psychiatric unit. I had been assigned to a schizophrenic patient who had displayed severe aggression in his last admission. I had remembered this specifically from his last admission, and I thought I would be more prepared to handle him. Boy, was I wrong. In a matter of seconds after introducing myself, he jumped from his seat and grabbed my left arm. My shoulder dislocated nearly immediately, rendering me completely defenseless. Thankfully, he threw no punches at me, but he held onto my arms as I called for help. Eventually a nurse was able to push him back, and in that adrenaline rush I grabbed him with my good arm to take him to seclusion with the nurse. Somehow, with my dislocated arm, we were able to escort him to the seclusion room for unit safety. It is one of the craziest things I had ever experienced, and to this day I still have nightmares about it. Today, I still do not have 100% range of motion in my shoulder or arm, and I think that will be the case forever. It was a very bad thing to happen to me, and I am fortunate it did not get any worse. It is a crazy thing to remember as I write this and it still affects me emotionally. Fortunately, I have been able to use some mindfulness meditation to get it off my mind whenever the memory creeps up on me.",,3IRIK4HM3B6UQBC0HI8Q5TBI19E6C7,0.0

Over the years I've loaned them quite a bit of money (which they never repay) when I've been optimistic that they're straightening out their lives and need help to move forward.  This July they lost their jobs as motel managers in Utah and returned here, homeless with two cats and a dog.  They moved into my daughter's garage and went on a ten-day bender.  They neglected their pets, had violent arguments, didn't return their U-Haul which was about to be reported as stolen, etc.  My daughter asked my son's wife to leave after she made a drunken scene insulting her neighbors.  She got a motel room and decided she'd just like to stay there.  My daughter and I handled everything for them and my son eventually snapped out of it.  He asked me if he could borrow $250 which he'd repay when he got a check in the mail in a few days and I foolishly agreed.  The check did come and he called me and said he was coming right over with the money and asked if he could do some laundry.  I haven't seen him since.  He took the money and paid for some more nights in the motel room and lots of vodka.  I was taking care of his dog who howled all day and night with separation anxiety.  I've been worried and scared for my son's health and safety for a long time but after this incident, that's changed into anger and fear for my own safety from people who absolutely put alcohol ahead of everything in life.  It was a new low since before lying and stealing hadn't been part of the picture.",3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG,3ITXP059PX5MLNG3YNSFT2K5ITLJSG,0.0

We clicked on a level I didn't think I would be able to click with someone else. I instantly felt a deep connection when meeting this person online. It was a pleasure to actually get to see her face, hug her and just talk to her in a real situation and it was fantastic to just be with her. I felt like a part of me that was missing was finally here. The first day we met, we went to the lake. It was wonderful to see her face as she realized the expanse of this lake. Playing in the water and collecting rocks for our rock hounding was so much fun. When we were done, we compared rocks and laughed over who found what and who had the prettiest. Sitting by the bonfire and just talking was so calming and peaceful. The heat of the fire, the flames burning bright in the dark night made for a surreal environment. Then going to ren fest, we both dressed up as different characters and boy did we laugh. It was hot outside and sticky but we had fun laughing and playing our roles. Overall, this was a very rewarding and fulfilling experience.",3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC,3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC,0.0

They call it his regiment.  A doctor told them that he needs to taper off but not slowly.

We enjoyed the flames licking at the logs and the warmth spreading out from the fire. We made smores and had a few drinks, spending most of our time just talking laughing and joking about life. At my house I have motion sensor lights. One night when we were sitting in the back yard around the bonfire one of the motion sensor lights kept going on and off. The odd thing about this was that it had never acted that way before. Talk around the bonfire went to ghosts and spirits, we joked that there may be a ghost trying to get our attention. Laughingly she said ""We see that you are here and recognize your presence."" After that the light did not go on again. This was something that we both found interesting, it's like she acknowledged whatever was going on and it was happy to be acknowledged it. The night was uneventful after that but it was the topic of conversation for the next few days, even though we had bonfires after that, we didn't experience that situation for any of those other bonfires. The other thing we enjoyed tremendously was going to Ren Fest. It was hot and humid that day but we both dressed as different Steam Punk characters. There were so many different things to look at and enjoy, we got to experience the fire whip, the jousting and the comedy troop. We spent hours just going through the different shops, enjoying the wares that were sold. And the food, don't get me going on the turkey legs, we spent so much time stuffing our faces with the different specialty foods that when we came home we both joked we would need too go on a diet. The sights, sounds and flavors that assaulted our senses were something that I will never forget.",3IUZPWIU1PTA3O3U0D2SR6N31EMWKC,,0.0

I went to my high school reunion! I can't believe I actually did it! And that it was so much fun... When I got the invite months ago, my first reaction was ""Naahhh, not going..."" But then I started thinking about it and felt a bit like a coward not wanting to even take the small risk of spending an uninteresting evening. So I decided I would go. When I showed up there, the first thing that struck me was how little the school had changed. It was a bit like a time warp actually. There were some small things that were more current, but mostly, the place was still very much the same, with the same vibe. Then there were the people. And that's when I could see time had passed, although more for some than others. I had wondered whether or not it would be an occasion to talk to people I didn't use to be close to. You know, like, now we're all adults and we've changed so we're more open to other things and it's easy to reach out to someone and just get to know them - more than back then. But actually, no. The groups reformed almost immediately as they were back then. And I suppose it's normal. When I got there, my old friends had pretty much all arrived and were in a corner, chatting very happily. They spotted me and called to me and that was it. Back to the good old times. It was so much fun to see them again. Most of them I had totally lost track of, although I'm still in touch with two of them. So there was a lot of catching up. But also a lot of reminiscing. And the result was completely seamless and very lighthearted and breezy.  Time flew by. And then it was 2 AM and we were the last crew standing and they had to kick us out. And because that's what we are/were, we moved our little party to the lawn in front of the school and we kept on partying for another hour and a half.",3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW2BX09BA,3IXQG4FA2UKYYPMS1PF7EJW2BX09BA,0.0

I'm not the kind of person that likes big events, and usually avoid large crowds. For my sister, I was more than willing to put aside my own anxiety. My sister is a very special person to me. I was always close to her, and being able to see her that happy made me feel full of joy. Unfortunately, the wedding didn't go off without a hitch. There was one embarrassing moment when the ring boy was walking down the aisle. I felt so bed for him because he turned to smile as he walked by his mom and tripped over his own feet. He went down pretty hard and then there was a scramble to find the ring. My sister, being the gentle and caring person she is, went up to the boy and told his it was alright. The rest of the wedding went smoothly. There were a lot of tears, and even more smiles. Seeing my sister say ""I do"" was a very memorable moment to me. She looked so happy in that moment. I felt a little sad, knowing that my sister would be around less, but that was quickly replaced by my elation.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMO056TQ,0.0

We've been talking for over a year about getting a new car, he knew I wanted another Hyundai and this time I wanted a crossover. He even got red, my favorite color. The interior is beige fabric, I like fabric seats rather than leather, it has a backup camera, a great sound system, and I am able to connect my phone with bluetooth. The first thing I did was to connect my phone and drive up the road and call my husband using the buttons on the steering wheel.   I've never had a brand new car so this is so exciting for me. It is going to take a little while to get used to such a big vehicle, and use the back up camera but I already love this car and feel that its comfortable to drive. It has everything that I want without overdoing the extras. I'm so happy. It will also be great for when my daughter comes to visit, it has a lot more room for her 2 boys, and it will be much easier getting them in and out, and plenty of space for all of the extra that you need when traveling with little ones.  I no longer have to worry about space when I go grocery shopping and its not so big that my mother cannot get in and out when I pick her up. I know how Mark is and I'm sure he cannot wait to go over every little thing in the manual. I hope he doesn't start tearing into the engine, I'll have to remind him that it's a new car and he doesn't have to rebuild it. Well its starting to look like the Huyndai is now our brand, it's our third one and Kevin recently bought a new Huyndai as well. I can't wait for tomorrow, we're going on a little road trip to give it a good work out and see how she runs.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMXLX6TX,0.0

My father asked me ,do you have a girlfriend? I said no i don't have,  are you gay, i don't know what to say at this point i was very nervous. I just said if I said no are you going to believe or if I said yes are you going to accept me?  My father said ever since you are a child i knew it , i just don't have the courage to asked. and i accept you regardless because you are my son and i love you.

When I originally enlisted at the age of 18, I only planned on serving for 4 years. I planned on earning the money for college, saving up my money for life expenses, and gaining some training that would aid in better employment. Instead I found myself going career. A big factor was the conflicts overseas. What people do not understand is that your co-workers are more than just your co-workers or friends but family. You serve together for several years your family aid one another. You go through the thick and think, the good and bad together. In Iraq I witnessed many of my family members wounded or killed. How could I turn tail and leave the service after all that I had seen and been apart of? This is why my retirement was so hard to accept because I still feel as if I can give but I know it is time to move on. At my retirement my unit presented me several awards. I received multiple handshakes and hugs goodbye. It was my family coming out to say goodbye to me since I may never see most of them again in my life. It is a scary moment as I am now faced with the question of what to do with my life after spending over 20 years being told what to do and when to do it. I've never cried at work but a former patient of mine that I treated through 40 surgeries traveled 1300 miles just to appear at my retirement and say goodbye. That is how close your co-workers become. They're family.",,3IXEICO7935BCSEB343GU3BMWFR6TE,0.0

I was relatively unsure as I thought we were meant for each other. We gave it a go and both decided it wasnt for us. Lately though we have found our life in the bedroom a bit boring and were discussing with friends over dinner. They said they had felt that way too and didnt know what to do. We told them about our earlier escapades into swinging and they were shocked. They had never tried that but were interested in the concept. After a few drinks we just decided to go for it. Maybe it was the booze, or the closeness of our relationship but we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. I am not sure that we would do it again but it was a new spice to the relationship. I think if you were looking at adding something it shouldnt be the first thing you try but overall can be rewarding. We also were in the same room so got to see our partners in action. Surprisingly nobody became uncomfortable. Its also nice knowing when we get together with others we all have a secret. Maybe we will have to swing again sometime.",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H1VP60H,0.0

It was me, my husband and 3 boys who were 11, 6 and 1 years old at the time. I was very nervous about how easy and relaxing it would be with 3 boys at the beach, especially with my 1 year old, but it went so smooth and was so much fun! Our condo was beach front and we had an umbrella and chairs set up for us every morning so that made things very easy with 3 boys! It was also very nice to already have a spot saved for us. We spent every day down at the beach. My kids had a blast in the water and on the sand, riding the waves in the water and building sand castles in the sand. Not once was I stressed and not once did the boys complain that they were bored! The older two boys played great together and the baby was happy just being there, played in the sand, played in the water, waved to people that were nearby. He loved the beach and whenever he was tired he would crawl up on my lap or my husbands lap and take an hour plus nap. We also played miniature golf one day, got ice cream a couple of the days and went to dinner a couple of the nights. The weather was very hot but it wasn't unbearable. It only rained one of the days which was great! It was honestly one of the best beach vacations I have ever been on, if not the best. It was a very memorable vacation and I will cherish those memories that were made.",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H08Z06A,0.0

I had told him that I was in the process of re-doing my kitchen. In the kitchen of the house he was renovating was a newer style stove. It was considerably better than the original stove that was in my house and he offered for me to have it. I was very thankful and appreciative of him letting me have it. The timing of the event couldn't have been better. I gave him some advice on some projects he was thinking of doing at his house. When I completed my project I invited them over to come see how it turned out. I also showed him the new stove and thanked him again. It has been a nice addition to my house. When I see it I am glad.

However, the events leading up to the ceremony were pretty stressful. To start, the weather was lousy. We were having an outdoor wedding. It looked like it was going to rain, and it was already very windy. We were worried that some of the setup might just blow over from the wind. Also, we hit a lot of traffic going over to the venue, and I was already very stressed. My wedding dress also felt like it was not fitting right, even though it fit perfectly when I tried it on numerous times before. However, this could have been in my head, as I was already very stressed about the wedding and everything that was going on. It's not like I did not love my soon to be husband. Nor did I have second thoughts about it. On the contrary, I love him very much, and I was just looking forward to getting the ceremony started. When I finally walked down the aisle with my father and I saw my husband to be, I felt way better. Seeing him standing up there just seemed to alleviate all the stress. With that being said, the most surprising thing that happened was when the ring bearer tripped and fell. He quickly got up though, and he acted like nothing happened. It ended up not raining, and the wedding was relatively calm after that.",,3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCCX8WQ0,0.0

We hear of them and read about them in newspapers almost daily. Such accidents often result in lose of life and material. These are caused by the carelessness of the drivers and their ignorance and negligence of the traffic rules. A few days ago I returned from Pennsylvania where I visited my brother. He had just got his driving licence and had just started to drive on his own without an instructor sitting together with him in the car. Unfortunately we had two accidents during our 4-day stay. Luckily no one was injured, but the car was partly damaged, especially at the second time. I'll tell you the story of the 2nd accident in brief ""We got off the highway and entered a country road leading to our summer house. We were driving at a speed of nearly 40 km/h and saw a railway bridge ahead of us. The road narrowed under the bridge we had to pass. We were expected to before the bridge, but my brother didn't notice the warning sign since it was hidden by a tree. We had to give way to a big truck coming from the opposite direction but didn't due my brother's failure to notice the sign. When we saw the truck approaching us, we abruptly slammed on the brakes and my brother turned the steering to the right thinking was a lane there, but actually that was the lane for traffic in the opposite direction and as a result our car hit the sidewalk right under the bridge and it stopped after the collision. Luckily we didn't collide head-on with the truck. The right tyre burst, the rim was dented, but the biggest problem was the front steering column, which broke into two parts. However, there was a car service centre right near the place of our accident and they helped us repair the car so that we could drive home"".",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9H2X406V,0.0

We had been leading up to this event for a long time. She became very nervous. At night she would tell me that she didn't want to go to kindergarten.  I think her nervousness came from our nervousness. She is our first born, and this was a monumental event in her life. She had gone to preschool, but this felt very different. We tried to do things to make her more excited.  we took her shopping for back-to-school clothes. She did get a little excited about that. We also had an informal event at the school, so she got a chance to look at the school and the things in the classroom. I made sure to take the day off, so that I could help take her to school and be there when she got home.  we got to the classroom, and she found it in and seemed to be having a great time. Before we even got to the school, we took a lot of pictures of her. We took pictures of her on our porch, and pictures of her in front of the school. It was very moving to see her so grown up and ready to go to school. After school that day, she came home. She came through the door and threw her arms up in the air and told us that she loved kindergarten. It was so relieving to know that she had had a good time. In some ways it was more moving hearing how excited she was about the day, then it had been watching her leave to go to kindergarten. In either event, it was a very moving day for me and my wife.",,3J2UYBXQQMYAWJHK52F6AS9HBSK06A,0.0

""There is a slight gas leak under the sidewalk in front of your property,"" he said. ""We discovered it May 31st. A crew will come do the repair around July 15th."" My eyebrow went up. He saw it, and added, ""it's a very, very small leak, so it's ok to wait. We use a machine that can detect parts per million. Yours is something like 5 parts per million."" Should I trust them? This gas company was the one responsible for the San Bruno explosion in 2010, and also the Northern California wildfires last year. This company is bankrupt and owes something like $20 billion. Maybe they are being more proactive now in looking for leaks to avoid more lawsuits. But should I trust them? What option do I have? I'm no expert. July 15th was a long time to wait. Would I get blown up if Fourth Of July fireworks set off the gas? No, no, he assured me. This guy seemed to know what he was doing. Ok, I'll wait. The following week the little colored flags were planted to mark the gas lines, electric lines, phone lines, cable TV line, and water pipe, very colorful to match the American flags on Independence Day. Tick tock. Tick tock. Nerves were just beneath the surface. Finally the day came, and they showed up in force with several huge trucks with digging equipment. It took them from 8:30 am till 8 pm to plug the leak. Sigh of relief all around.",3J4Q2Z4UTZPWER1PDIMPNSZCTQ7QWW,,0.0

This event took place roughly two months ago. What made this trip so special was the fact that it was the first time my children have ever been to the beach. I have a son who is five and a daughter who is three. Another special moment on this trip was we went with friends and family. While we were down there, we got to meet up with a special person in my life that I served with in the United States Marine Corps. I had not seen this friend for five years so it was a great reunion for us to get together and catch up. While in Destin, Florida, we stayed at a condo that was right on the beach. The views from our room were amazing and the water was crystal clear. We were also amazed at how beautiful and white the sand was. It felt like we were walking on silk. Aside from hanging out on the beach all day, we also went to out to eat at some very nice restaurants. I got to eat some fresh seafood. We're from Ohio so the seafood we can get in Florida is not like the seafood we can get in Ohio. On one of the nights we went out to play miniature golf. On another night, we went and rode go-carts with the kids. The duration of the trip was a week-long. I wish we could have stayed longer as we had such a fun time. I feel like the trip went by very fast. We plan on coming back to Destin, Florida next year as we liked it so much. Honestly, this was one of the most memorable trips I have ever been on. I will keep the memories of this trip forever in my mind.",3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7UU0L98,3JAOYWH7VJQABY84S241SMS7UU0L98,0.0

I will cherish this memory forever. The wedding was just great! When it's my turn to speak up the wedding, I went up the podium and spoke about how great a person my friend is.

I missed my sons so bad and strangely when i was visiting my father who lives in the Dominican republic that sadness hit me so bad. I saw how happy and sad my dad was and i became just sad. and i was going to be sad for 4 more weeks. even that motivation for money for my sons to give them a better life didn't subside my guilt. i was telling my dad about my feeling and he just laughed because he's been feeling this way most of his life. and i started to laugh and hanging with my dad was great. so after the 5 weeks i went back home and the relief  had when i saw my babies. and now i never wasn't to leave them.,3JMSRU9HQJGU2ZBFEHMT79RKDRUEVB,,0.0

I was afraid at first because the dog in the yard was huge and looked as if if could bite me. Seeing this child by himself and standing at the gate had me afraid for him so I opened the gate slowly and the dog let me in. The child said his mommy was hurting and needed help. I am a nurse and so immediately my skills kicked in. His mommy was on the floor and about to deliver her baby. The lady spoke little english and was so afraid and kept saying ""help me"". I know a little Spanish to get by and tried calming her.  I told the little boy to dial 911 on my phone and hold it to my ear while I talked to them. I started breathing in and out to help the mom become more relaxed. I was feeling a little overwhelmed but knew that their lives depended on me. The baby came after a few  pushes and I ended up safely delivering the baby and making sure the mom was ok. They ended up taking the mother to the hospital I worked at and I ended up taking care of her that night while at work. The mother and I both cried when we saw each other and her husband hugged and thanked me for helping them. I can honestly say I was scared of what could have happened, but thankful I was there to help them. I will never forget that day as long as I live.",,3JPSL1DZ5TLE4HLUWLYG197GVJVNAI,0.0

We celebrated at a very nice restaurant located in the Arts District of Downtown LA that my Dad had never been to. Upon finishing our meal he remarked that he had grown up within walking distance of the restaurant. Considering we had time to kill before the movie we had planned to see later, Dad decided to show us the house where he spent several of his formative years. My dad is a natural storyteller and he's immensely proud of his hometown so it was an extra gift in itself to see and hear him gesticulate and intone about stories from his childhood and which friends used to live where and what kind of misadventures he got himself into as a young boy. Our kids were very taken by some of the mischief my dad would get into, like shining the shoes of local gangsters, or ducking away from the school bullies by running across he rooftops and sometimes jumping from roof to roof over great heights to escape a beating. They laughed at his comedic embellishments, and they were more than a little incredulous at his fierce independence and feisty spirit, considering Dad was telling them how he was basically given free reign as a five year old to explore his surroundings by himself. He told us several intimate personal details like how strained his relationship was with his stern and often emotionally cold father and how he would find solace and understanding in the warmth of his mom. He also mentioned details about the day she died when Dad was only sixteen, which he very rarely does. This cross generational sharing is very important to my wife and I. It gives our kids perspectives into their own lives and a sense of history as to where they come. It also gives them insight into their own emotional makeup and personal perspectives. Our kids have a strong moral center, and a ""can do"" attitude when it comes to fixing their own problems. I think it's very valuable for them to know that the are values that we have tried very hard to instill in them in order to make them strong and productive members of society working for the public good. When you're young you think that birthdays are all about the cake, the presents, and the celebration of yourself, and in many ways those aspects are very important to my family. But as I get older I find that the only thing I really want is to be secure in the knowledge that my family knows how tight and lasting our connections are to each other and how our common bonds come from a place of great emotional depth. We had a lovely rest of the day and I was showered with generosity throughout but the greatest gift was experiencing the richness of our family identity.",3JNQLM5FT58ZBEN57TPMIZKTOOQL2G,,0.0

There were plenty of bedrooms for everyone so both my parents and my inlaws came along, along with our kids and some of their friends.  We all wanted to get out on the water and we rented some kayaks to use while we there.  Everyone was taking turns and having fun but my mother-in-law refused to try it.  Finally after a lot of pushing by just about everyone, she finally decided to give it a try.  It was so funny she was really pretty freaked out about the entire thing.  But she got in the kayak just fine and managed to have some fun kayaking along the shoreline.  It was hard not to laugh when she finished.  She got back to the dock and just stared at all of us.

The way he looks at her with such love and respect truly makes me so happy.  It is a beautiful day and the ceremony was perfect.  I couldn't help but cry through most of it.  The best partof the day was my son telling me how much he loved me.  He said I was the reason he was the person he is today!  He is so kind and such a good person.

When I became pregnant with my first child I determined to do everything possible to maintain my health as well as the the health of my developing child. This included regular visits to my OB/GYN for checkups. After one visit for routine tests, I got a text to contact the doctor's office as soon as possible. I called immediately, and shocked to be told the test result indicate that my baby may have Downs Syndrome. While still trying to process that news, the doctors told me the best thing I could do is to terminate the pregnancy. I was stunned. How could this be? I have been taking meticulous care of health. I had no statistical markers for risk of have a Downs child. I cried for day, not knowing what to do. Finally, I asked the doctor's office to send the test results indicating this diagnosis. It turns out, the test I took was not even for Downs. There was no way for the doctor to make that determination. The stress of this situation caused me to go into labor 3 months early. And Alex was born healthy. After a 2 weeks in MICU, he came home with and doing great. Now that I have the time and energy, I have hired a law firm that specializes in medical malpractice.

My hubs is not the type to go above and beyond for things, but he is thoughtful. So when he said we could go to my favourite restaurant, Hamirs, and go and see a movie, I was excited to do so! I had not been to Hamir's in so long, and I know my hubs isn't the biggest Indian food fan, so I thought it was so sweet that he would want to go there anyway, even though it's not his favourite. When we went to Hamirs, I noticed there were gorgeous sheets in these beautiful Indian prints hanging over the front windows. Usually the windows are really open and you can see inside. When we walked in, I was completely overwhelmed to see about a dozen of my friends and close co-workers! I was so surprised! When I was hugging everyone and screaming and smiling and 'yay'ing' over it, I noticed in the corner, my best friend from HS, waiting for me!! I couldn't believe it! She had come all the way from Massachusetts to see me! I started crying and she started crying, and we had such a moment! I had not seen her for about 3-4 years. The food was absolutely amazing and the conversation and just ambiance was so perfect! Hamir made my favourite dish, which is the chicken tandoori! The dinner and my friends showing up was a big enough gift, but I also received so many awesome gifts! Lots of Starbucks and Sephora gift cards! My best friend got me a Kate Spade wallet. My mom and sister got me a new pair of headphones. My husband went above and beyond for this one, it was crazy. I couldn't believe he went to all this, and behind my back without me knowing. Somehow, he was able to reach out to everyone. When I asked him how he did it, he said he found our addresses/email list that I keep on excel on our computer, and he was able to contact everyone via the email addresses I had in there. I was super bummed because I didnt take any photos but luckily, so many of my friends came through! When I got on facebook and IG the next day, there were so many tagged photos. It was awesome to see the different people in my life all in one space. My work friends, my new friends my old friends, and my family. I never really had many big birthday parties in my life, and I never had a surprise party, so this was a first for me, and it is truly something that I will treasure for a long time.",3JW0YLFXRU21YOXBPRLVFHHYPG3WW7,,0.0

I went to her funeral expecting to feel upset. I was shocked when I went up to the casket and felt nothing. Of course I felt bad that she was dead, but I didn't feel any sadness at all. I walked away from the casket and started talking to some of the other people we grew up with.

There were so many wonderful people there celebrating her life and embracing her for the wonderful woman she was. People from all over the country showed up, which was really powerful. It was kind of overwhelming for me though, because everyone wanted to talk to me! Thankfully, I had a few of my very close friends there to support me. My coworkers from the farm where I work even showed up. They didn't know my mother, but they wanted to be there to support me. My brother played a piece on the piano that he dedicated to my mom. A lot of extended family members also showed up and they got to meet my boyfriend. Having my boyfriend there was probably the most helpful because he has stood by me though all of this! He never got to meet my mom, which is something I really regret. However, he loves me and will always stand by me.",3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMOSXNBN,3JWH6J9I9TZJNRQM2ZYCWKRMOSXNBN,0.0

Initially I did not give it much thought and considered it a waste of time. After hearing some stories about how people are actually making impact just by using podcast as a means to share their honest view of various issue and people are actually willing to listen to it. I decided to listen to one, so I had my friend recommend one for me about 2 months ago, and he did. I tuned in after getting home from work, at first I did not get the idea but once I paid attention I realized what every was saying. I became a regular listeners of that podcast. A month later I was laid off at my job, I guess due to restructuring. I had nothing to do I was just at home all day everyday sleeping and eating, and maybe go out with my friends once in a while. At one of those outings I met the voice behind my favorite podcast and he told me how he got started. I decided to give it a shot, and then I did some research for about a week. I had no reason not to, no job, just bills to pay. 2 weeks ago I went live, I only had a few listeners, with few regular downloads at first. About 5 downloads to be precise and they were all my friends I suspected. One day I was just frustrated and I started ranting about my former job. This rant attracted people, I was amazed. Though I never the name of the company Where I worked but I said some things to me day to day and people seemed to like stories. I just kept on telling them different story everyday and now I am very successful as I have over 5,000 downloads every week.",,3JZQSN0I3RW3QGLGKX7DPQ9A1B9FGO,0.0

His job, his friends, his hobbies, general anecdotes from his life. He was not interested in hearing stories from my life. Even as they relate to a shared interest among the two of us. We both enjoy hiking. He frequently retold stories of his endeavors, especially in public settings. He spoke loudly, and always pulled up the same photo on his phone. I don't believe in being rude, especially to a person I'm partnered with. So I reacted with intrigue. Finding new things to point out. On a particular occasion, I wanted to show him a photo of a solo mountain hike I recently completed. He was not interested. At that point, I began to realize something wasn't right.

He is ten years old and has big mischievous eyes and curly brown hair. His favourite food is masala data and he loves to cat ice-creams. He runs very fast and always wins lots of medals for his school. He is the captain of his school athletics team, lie also loves to read books, watch movies and play video games. John stays in Newyork and visits us in the summer holidays every year. When he visited us last year, we had a lot of lint by joining a swimming camp and taking guitar lessons together. I am very excited because my mother has promised that John.  I can celebrate our birthday this year by throwing one big party for all our friends. I have so much fun whenever John visits that I sometimes wish that he stayed near us so that I could him meet him every day and we could study in the same school together!

My aunt and uncle forgot until the last minute to buy a cake because they had been so busy. They only realized this during the party, so they rushed out to buy a cake. When they finally had time to get to the bakery, they bought the first cake they could find without checking what kind it was. While they were gone, my nephew was opening his presents as fast as he could, because he was more interested in eating his cake than his actual presents. We watched as he opened many presents with new toys, without caring because he was so excited for his cake. When my aunt and uncle returned, he just about leapt out of his seat and ran to them. He couldn't wait to have a piece of his birthday cake. They sliced the cake with a knife, and gave him the first piece. When he tasted the cake, he immediately spat it out. It was carrot cake! He was so upset. He wasn't even interested in playing with his new toys because his birthday was ruined by the last-minute carrot cake his parents had bought. None of the adults thought the cake was terrible, we all enjoyed it.

My son always loved mountain biking and was getting quite good at it. When I agreed to bike on some trails with him I was not sure what to expect, however I was excited to see what it's like. I knew how to bike quite well but I hadn't gone on any serious mountain bike trails yet. I remember when we arrived at the trail, he told me to follow him and that he would go slow. I was surprised how much stamina and focus it took to go down these trails right away but I kept up with my son at first. After a few minutes of going down the trail, however, my memory of the event gets hazy. What I do remember is that the trail started to feature these large jumps, and my son would back flip off every single one. So I figured since he's doing so many back flips, I would be able to do at least one pretty easily. The last I remember is getting so much air off the jump that I was headed straight into a river next to the trail. After that I don't remember anything until I woke up in the hospital, but my son tells me I performed a triple back flip off the biggest jump and landed straight in the river, and that he was able to get me out. But when he did, I apparently wasn't breathing, and thankfully he was CPR certified and was successful. Since then my memory has been pretty bad, I think I hit my head on a rock even though I was wearing a helmet. Since then I have been pretty terrified of biking at all. But I know one day I'll have to face my fear and perform that trick again, even though my son tells me not to.",,3K4J6M3CXFF8UP489HLLBPYJ5XRGAC,0.0

I've been so busy since then that I'm just now writing about it.  I'm such a procrastinator!  My best friend and I were on our way to see my favorite band, Highly Suspect, perform at the Amphitheater when I heard my phone ringing from the depths of my purse.  I almost didn't answer it because I was driving and all that, but my best friend fished it out of the abyss for me.  I am SO glad I took the call!  It was an automated call from the local rock station I listen to religiously on my way to and from work, telling me I had won a trip to Las Vegas.  They have a web page where you can enter-for-a-chance-to-win stuff like T-shirts, concert tickets and vacations (obviously).  I had totally forgotten about it because I never win anything, even though I check the page daily for new contests.  I was so excited when I got that call, having never been to Las Vegas, that I immediately called the radio station.  I almost thought it wasn't real.  The lady who answered the phone assured me that if I had gotten the automated call I had definitely won the trip.  She got real quiet and said she needed to check something, so she put me on hold.  When she came back on the line it was with the most awesome, unexpected news!  I had actually won a trip to Mexico.  This excited me even more, because I've always wanted to go to Mexico.  It was the most amazing trip and I will forever remember it!",,3K3R2QNK8CPDUOVY1GW2J9OQ8TVU9U,0.0

I twisted my foot and ruptured my Achilles tendon in the process. Ouch! I immediately knew that I had a serious injury. The pain shot up from my ankle area and I could no longer stand up.  A couple of my fellow players helped me to a bench and I sat down, hoping that it was just a sprain that would heal up with time and ice.  But it soon became apparent that I should probably get the thing looked at. I didn't think that I could drive with my injury, so I got a friend to drive me to the clinic,  The doctor told me I was in for a long recover. Bummer! So I have been limping and babying my foot since that day. The tendon seems to be taking its sweet time healing. I am getting very tired of hopping along on crutches, but that is my fate until I am whole again. At work they call me ""Hopalong"". I think that I will play soccer again, but I will use ace bandage wraps on my ankles from now on.

His passing was tragic, but in all the time that has passed I don't feel as though I've really come to terms with losing him. So I had been thinking of a way that I could finish the grieving process and come to terms with everything. Then, I thought about something that he always talked about. He used to say that when he finally retired he would put away his work suit and put on his gardening rags. I always rolled my eyes, thinking if he really wanted to garden he'd make time for it in the present. But every time our family tour the nearby Botanical Gardens  I would see the longing on his face. The contentment he seemed to have when he'd bring home a plant he picked out, brought home and nurtured, then gave to a friend. Even though he's gone now, I want to feel closer to him. I want to fulfill his dream of gardening for happiness and pleasure. So from now on, until I can no longer, I will be spend every weekend tending to my father's dream garden. I'll find all his favorite plants. I'll even pull out all of his old landscape designs. I'll figure out a way to incorporate his ideas into my own land.

But, I have been too afraid to do so.  Three months ago,  I finally got brave, and went to the local park and went to the pond.   At the Gathering Place's pond, a worker helped me get fitted for a life vest and kayak.    I was given some basic rowing instructions.    Then, I was able to sit down in the kayak.   And, I was off.   I didn't know how to row well, at first.   So, I promptly rowed myself into the pond's edge - the weeds.    I guided the paddles backwards, and I was free to explore the five acre pond.   I learned how to row the paddles correctly, and I was amazed at how fast I could go.   I was so happy, I could feel my legs tighten and arms heavy, but I knew I was getting a good workout.  After 60 minutes, I decided to take the kayak back to the boathouse.   I was hot and tired, but satisfied I did so well.   When I returned the building, a dock worker helped me get out of the kayak.   I stood up, and then took my lifejacket off.   I was so happy, I learned how to kayak.",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRX3FLN7,0.0

It was 4 months ago when I rode the Metro as usual after work. I had stayed back to cover an important part of my task before going home. At 8 pm, I was just leaving the office. I was pretty famished and all in my head was what I will get to bite when I reach home. I sat down gently by the window. The seat next to me was empty and I was just praying it wouldn't be a mother with a kid that will come and sit next to me. I like kids but at that point, I didn't just want one to disturb my peaceful ride back home. I brought out my phone and starting checking Reddit for the popular posts on that day. The seat next to me was still empty. I didn't know what made me look far right, beyond an elderly man was this lady on glasses. Her nose came out a little than the other girls I know. Just when I was praying that she looks sideways so I see what she looks like, she turned sideways. I froze at the spot. It took about 10 seconds to caution myself that I've been staring way too much. Those 10 seconds were the most enchanting moment of my life. The elderly man seated next to her left and maybe not wanting to sit alone, she came to sit just beside me.  I can't say maybe it was the scent of her that made my nervous that one word could not leave my already slightly opened lips or that I didn't expect her to make that move. I just slowly turned back to checking Reddit. I still feel bad I didn't even say Hi.",,3K9FOBBF2I5V00CYTCN6ANNRYWYLND,0.0

I went into my office and started to prep for my workday. I heard him bumping into the doggie gate in the hallway. After about four times of this, I opened the office door to check on him. I quickly noticed that something was wrong with his eyes and that he could not see. My heart sank. I was home alone with him and didnt know what to do. I immediately started to panic.

She looked frail, thin. She was more patient and loving and was accepting of my recent unorthodox career choices. I felt myself opening up to her more and feeling at ease in saying what I wanted to.

I remember still hearing those words and felt so crappy about it. I wish I could go back and take the words back on what I said. Things were wrong between us. I couldn't look him in the eyes anymore. I felt so crappy and still remember those feelings. I would go and visit him and think how crappy I was to him. He would apologize for this and I would apologize and cry to him. This went on and on and finally I was able to save his life with my bone marrow. I really felt better at that point. Now years have passed and I am thankful for this.,,3KIBXJ1WD6G2YFUS9RBIACAHAPLOKS,0.0

The day I yearned for and prayed for and hoped for. Since I was 12 years old, I was in near constant pain from my menstrual cycle that no doctor was willing to diagnose properly or do any more than throw some ibuprofen in my face and walk away. It's the woman's burden (what are we in 17th century Europe?), or you'll grow out of it. Well, I am now in my 30's and if wasn't for chemotherapy to suppress my hormones, I wouldn't be able to walk or work. Thankfully, I met my savior shortly after turning 30. My mom passed away and I had a lot of feelings to work through; so I began seeing a delightful woman as my psychologist who recommended a doctor that she used and had sent many other women for treatment; even women who were scared of the obgyn. I wasn't scared, I just wanted someone to listen, someone to care and Dr. O**a turned out to be all of that and funny too. She truly cared and searched for reasons for my pain. After ultrasounds, MRIs, blood tests, exams, finally we found out what I'd said all along...I have crappy lady bits. :P Fibroids, PCOS, Adenomyosis, Endometriosis; you name it, my uterus probably had it. And I knew I just wanted it out; I never wanted to have children, and I said if I changed my mind, I'd adopt. But, I was young, so she tried other things, all while making sure to keep my pain in check. After multiple attempts at birth control and hemorrhaging twice, requiring blood transfusions and hospital stays; we finally agreed something more drastic had to be done. We started lupron and then waited. It blocked all of my sex hormones and prevented the pain. But, it's a form of chemo so I couldn't be on it forever. After a year of lupron, we shook on it, I would have my hysterectomy. It was scheduled right away, but she was unfortunately diagnosed with MS and couldn't operate. I had to wait some more. But the end was in sight. She introduced me to another surgeon in the practice and we scheduled the surgery. After three long months of waiting, it's finally here. I will finally remove the uterus that has ruined most of my adult life and kept me from enjoying most things would be tossed in the trash bin, where it belonged.",,3KMS4QQVK3C8S2HZAOSSNI13IT0KFI,0.0

I will have to be totally self-sufficient. But I am doing my best to save her. I have some knowledge in health and nutrition. I believe that high iron and low iodine levels in her food contributed to her problems. The most useful thing that she has done is utilize an infrared heat lamp. I use one personally and can say that it helped my health, even though I don't have cancer. The issue is that her immune system is so overwhelmed that she can't fight the cancer properly. She needs to deal with all of the chronic infections and problems. They make her constantly tired and her appetite isn't very strong. If she passes away, it will be difficult for me because I have no family of my own. It is accelerating my realization that I need to find other people in my life that I can rely on.

I was to appear before a panel the next Monday to answer some questions and review my performance over the last 12 months. I was dressed up and ready to go. Just as I was walking to the conference room, A colleague mistakenly spilled his coffee on my shirt. I was devastated as I was specifically advised to appear as smart and neat as possible before the panel. I had no time to go home to change so I had to walk in that way. I was so tensed up. The first question I was asked was why I looked so tacky. I explained that few minutes ago, a colleague spilled his coffee on my shirt and there was no time to go and change my shirt. The members of the panel laughed and told me the session was not going to take more than 3 minutes. They said they had noticed my work ethic and just had to summon me for formality sake. They made positive remarks about my performance and told me to check my mail box for a break down of my scores. They then handed me a letter of confirmation which also contained information about an upward review of my salary as a confirmed member of staff. That was it.

It was my first child and I was so excited! It was a very fast labor. It only lasted an hour and a half. We were lucky we got to the hospital in time. It was especially nerve-racking because we had to drive through a blizzard for 30 minutes before we got there. I was well trained and kept my cool during the whole experience. I started the deep breathing before we left the house. Not only was there a blizzard, but it was dark! I prayed and prayed and kept a positive attitude throughout the experience. When she was born, they immediately took her to the side to examine her. This was after getting the cord from around her neck. I was worried, but kept a good attitude.

The day was August 14th to be exact.  My youngest child was starting kindergarten.  My baby was not a baby anymore.  I had trouble sleeping the night before.  I woke early that morning.  I did everything I could to hold back my emotions as I got him ready for the big day.  The time was finally here.  I drove him to school soaking up the last few minutes.  I had tears well up in my eyes as I walked him up to the school doors.  The most memorable part of that day was when he looked at me and smiled and told me everything would be ok.  He was comforting me.  That made my day and will be a treasured memory I will always have.  It is so hard to let go of your children and let them go out on their own.  I loved having him be by my side day after day, but now I can the pleasure of seeing what he can do on his own.

It has been a long sad process although this fate has been in the cards for quite some time now.  She was an alcoholic for most of her adult life and things had gotten quite bad over the past several years.  She disappeared and was out of touch for the past five years or so, we'd only hear where she was if she ended up in rehab, jail or the hospital. Last March I get a phone call that she is in the ICU and has only a short amount of time to live. I try to get back to see her but am unable to for a couple months.  This lead to a trip home in May and I wasn't even sure if I would get to see her. She happened to be back in the hospital the day after I landed and I was able to go in for a visit. This would be the last time I'd ever get to see my sister. She was so different and sick and completely ruined. She had been an brilliant young woman, beautiful  and could have had anything but she fell victim to a lack of family support and the harms of drugs and alcohol. I admit that I have had my own struggles throughout my life and often have thought about my sister while trying to straighten myself out, even long before she passed away.  She passed away one month ago to the day and it has been life-changing in many many ways, I'm trying to be better everyday so that I can find a way to honor her and not let her death be in vain.  I want to be able to help others that find themselves lonely and lost, like she often was. There is much that I need to learn and a lot of growth that I need, the loss is still fresh and I often find myself confused about how I'm feeling lately. All I know is that I'm changed and I won't let her memory be lost.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIII0B824X,0.0

That was my real blood father. Take into account he lives about four states away and time that has passed between visits was around six years. Now just because we live far apart doesn't mean we don't have a good relationship, we do it's just that while I was little he had to move away so he could make money to live. I didn't understand this at the time but as I am a adult now I understand this more than ever. What helped me understand this more was the fact that I now have kids myself and I get that you always do what is best to provide for them. So with the background that we have I was so happy and elated to finally see him again after all these years. Now don't get me wrong on another front I also have an amazing step father that helped my mother raise me when I was a young boy and I love just as much, so I am truly blessed on two fronts.  As the party passed and the day went on with lots of fun and happiness, I started to grow sad because I felt he would have to leave that night. He told me he was staying the weekend and actually planned a fishing trip with my step father also. I was so excited for this as I knew I would have the two most important men in my life for the whole weekend and fishing on top of that. I think to myself this is going to be the best weekend in almost six years for me personally.  So after this party we head out and pick up supplies for the trip and also picked up bait and such as well. So after arriving we set up camp and then cooked out and just sat and talked among us. To be honest the best part was that he included my step dad and they also bonded as well. I honestly don't think I could have asked for a better weekend that that, and to share it with two people that care about me was the icing on the cake. I was glad for that surprise and it is by far one of the better moments in my life.",,3KXIR214I523D6GK11Q5WIIITRV249,0.0

We played music and had a lot of games going. We would go hiking in the morning, and return in the afternoon. We loved doing this. They view from the top of the mountains was stunning.

I live about 5 and a half hours from my parents where I grew up and we don't have very much disposable income. Due to this, I often do not get to visit and my kids miss out on some quality time with their grandparents. My parents are very proud grandparents and very active when they are with my kids. I got a small bonus this summer and used it to go visit my parents so the kids could have some time to spend with them. We had a lot of fun throughout the whole time including spending time at the local lake for my mom's 70th birthday. This resulted in my kids playing some mini golf, fishing, and paddle boating all day long in the hot summer sun. We had water balloon fights and went out for ice cream and visited the specialty vintage toy and horror shop. My kids loved all of this and I loved all of this. There were so many other things that sparked a lot of joy during this visit. However, there was one thing we did on two different nights that brought me the most overwhelming positive emotion. My mom grabbed an old mayo jar in the evening one evening and my parents, my wife, me, and all 4 of my kids ran around at dusk in their big yard on the edge of the forest and caught fireflies until we couldn't see anything anymore (no street lights out there). Over the course of this, there were so many laughs and amazingly funny screams from the smallest kids when bugs landed on them. We saw bats flying around in the last sliver of daylight as well which sparked even more excitement. I felt like a kid again and loved being outside with everyone. It helped me hold onto my youth a little bit longer and made me appreciate my family and my parents even more.",3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRHMWODQ,3KYQYYSHYWTUK9OIHAPV6ZFRHMWODQ,0.0

To start with my relaxing morning I drew a bath with a bath bomb I'd been saving for such an occasion. The water was nice, warm and smelled delightful. I soaked for about 30 minutes. After my bath I looked around the house and realized it was a mess. To put my mind at ease I start tiding up and deep clean a good portion of my apartment. Now that my home looked as good as I felt, I began to get dressed to go to eat. I had given Mel a call to meet me there and she agreed. Feeling good and looked even better I grabbed my keys and went off. I finally get to the restaurant and I sit there wait for Mel to arrive. She texted me and said that she was gonna be a little late due to an accident on the freeway. I go ahead and order some coffee and a pastry while I wait. To get myself ahead in work for the following week, I respond and plan with client's requests and answer any questions they might have. As I'm sitting there typing, I notice a man checking me out from a couple tables in front of me. I looked over and it was clear to me that he wasn't my type. As I looked we had a split second of eye contact. He smiles and approaches me at the table. As he's walking up to the table, I desperately grab my phone and continue replying to clients. He looks at me and asks if I wanted to go out sometime. I tell him no. He makes another attempt and again I reject him. He gets frustrated and completely goes off. He goes on and calls me a bitch making a scene in the whole restaurant. He starts using racial slurs and tells me that I'm not pretty enough for him because of it. Embarrassed and harassed, I try to go on about my day but couldn't stop thinking about the incident.",,3L0KT67Y8F2CGCB2KNTI3PZTM3PYSN,0.0

To get ready I drank some coffee and went to the party. My cousins rented a local Italian restaurant for the party. It was a surprise and they were very shocked to see all of us there for the event. There was a lot of food. Seven courses in all. In the end I wasn't able to complete more than 5. I initially resisted having desert. But the rum cake they got for the party was so good that I was somehow able to finish two servings. I don't get to go home that often. It was nice to see my whole family together.

My 15-year old cat will wander outside and sit in the sun. He is getting older, but he is still spry enough to occasionally chase a squirrel. Well, I did not know Kitty-Kat was outside when I went to close the garage door. It is a heavy door, so I normally give it a little nudge and the thing will slam shut the rest of the way all by itself. I was totally aghast to see Kitty-Kat try to duck under the door just as it fell onto his neck. He could not even breath! I immediately opened the door enough to let him get up and come in. He wobbled a bit, but then he settled down onto a blanket I keep on the floor for him. Well, two weeks later, and Kitty-Kat was obviously in some distress. I remembered back to the garage door nearly strangling him. I scooped him up and ran to the vet's emergency room. I explained what happened. They took over, performing multiple tests on him. I know that the veterinarians did the best they could do under the circumstances, but they admitted that there were no medical procedures that would help my cat. They sent me home with some pain killers for him. That evening, my Kitty-Kat died. He was already old and had lived a long, eventful life. However, I still wailed out loud. My kitty was gone forever.

And more importantly, my students hated math. I figured if I could pull off the olympiad event I might make a good impression on the superintendent. I started getting everything together and realized it was going to be a lot of work. I had to get enough kids to participate, get parents to help, and get donations. I was doing pretty well and then I got a phone call that the school had decided to include the younger grade levels as well. All the work I had just done had to be redone, and at three times as much. Somehow I managed to pull it off. The event went perfectly, the kids all had fun. I looked really good and I was anxious to see if the SUperintendent would notice.

It is even worse that the town is prone to flooding due to poor drainage. Well, it was 2 months ago when I was proven right. There was a fierce storm that was lasting for days and days. It was raining so hard I thought it would never end. The streets were flooded and people were now stuck in their homes, unable to leave at all. Emergency services were going about the town as best as they could, helping people they came across. It was starting to get dark, and the floor waters had started to rise above the windows in our house. I tried calling 911 a few times, but there was little they could do. We were simply one of many calling for help at the same time. I was alone in the house with my mom that night and not even she could seem to keep calm. We had no choice but to wait out the night and hope for the best. We made sure all of the windows were shut tight and we secluded ourselves on the second floor of the house to try to stay above the water. We waited out the night, not sleeping at all. We were mostly too scared to go to sleep. This was probably the scariest night of my entire life. Luckily, we both made it out okay.",,3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFS8ZHDB1,0.0

It's been gone for 4 months and I still regret selling it. I know it is trivial to miss a car, but I have so many awesome memories while driving it.  I remember the day I bought my Chevy Corvette. It was 1970 and I was 23 years old. I had landed a great job and decided to buy a new car. I got to the dealership and fell in love with it the moment I saw it. I knew that was going to be MY car. It was so slick and I just knew that I would look so cool driving it around town. I would definitely be a hit with the ladies. In fact, it helped land my first date with the beautiful woman that is now my wife. 30 years and a 1000s of memories later, I had to say goodbye.  It was a relic of my youth and I knew selling it would go towards a good cause. I had decided to start a college fund for my new grandson. One day I'll tell him about my electric blue 1970 Chevy Corvette and maybe he will fall in love with cars too.",,3LO69W1SU4ZPQ8VC68ABK3EUZ97GLB,0.0

The floor was hectic and people were talking so loud. I had to leave and take a breather in the bathroom. I was worried about the way that everyone would see me afterwards. I didn't want to be so visible to everyone on just my second day back. I had no idea what to expect. Everything has been good though. Luckily everyone still welcomed me back to the team regardless.

It was a long time coming since they had both been together for what seemed like forever, so we were all expecting the proposal to be soonish. What I was more excited about was the bachelor party. My buddy and I get along extremely well. Almost too well. We both have a hugely diverse friend group who love to party, so I knew this was going to be nuts. What made this bachelor party nice was the fact the wedding still wasnt for another few months. He wanted it to be in the summer rather than winter since there were more things that we could do. So for this party, we all flew out to Denver. We both got some of our close friends out there and he had never been, so he thought it would be awesome to go out there and rage Milwaukee style, in Denver. We all flew out on a Thursday since the whole party/get together was from a Friday until Sunday. He wanted to stay until Monday, but if I knew myself and our group, there was no way we would want to stay an extra day in the condition we anticipated being in. So I flew out with another friend of mine Thursday evening and arrived at roughly 10pm. Far too late to actually do anything besides have a few brewskis and meet new friends. And that is exactly what we had done. Friday and Saturday both ended up being a complete blur. Between being kicked out of bars to losing people for hours, it was probably some of the most fun I have ever had. Between the groom and myself, we have some of the nicest guy friends in existence and it proved right this time around. I got to meet some of his friends that I had never met before despite always hanging out with the groom on the weekends at home. The best part about the trip was feeling like I left with more friends than I got there with, despite forgetting most of the experiences we shared together.",3LEP4MGT3HMA1FZ9D5K90FFSZXEBDJ,,0.0

She is a little older than my wife and I and I misjudged her based on her appearance. We talked a lot about music and I realized that she knew a lot of music and has very similiar musical tastes as me, which is surprising since I like a lot of lesser known bands. We then walked from dinner over to the concert venue, which was outside. I enjoyed the band a lot. I've seen them several times before so that was expected.

I've been working for months to get my mother state help for her dementia. I knew she had been diagnosed, but I didn't know how bad it was until then. Ever since then it's been constant calls, week-long trips down to try and get paperwork done, and worrying. So much anxiety that I've lost 30 lbs in the space of 4 months. Every week there was at least one crisis where my mother was overspending herself into the red because she couldn't remember getting money out of the bank that day, or signing up for multiple life insurance policies. When I first applied for Medicaid for her, I was instantly rejected and no one told me. I had to call up after a month before learning she made $195 too much in Social Security to qualify for assisted living. I was devastated and started crying. But I kept going, kept pushing, and found out that I could apply for home services because it had a higher income bracket. Getting the paperwork together from 250 miles away was hell and it took weeks and weeks even with help from my aunt who lived nearby. When we finally got it in, the Medicaid service worker who was helping me was taken off the case and her case was given to someone else, but they didn't tell me. It felt like a merry go round, and my head was always spinning. I spent a lot of nights crying when my mother would call and spout word salad, feeling like I was totally alone in the world. Everyone I called said they couldn't really help and some places didn't even pick up the phone. A long-distance caregiver, only child of a single mother, so young and trying to care for her mother with dementia when she should be having kids and starting a family. I didn't want to be self-pitying, but I did fall into it sometimes. Then I opened my mailbox and it happened. It was a letter saying that she was approved for Medicaid waiver HCBS and that she could start immediately. I dropped to my knees and started crying, knowing that the fight wasn't over but that at least I had some sort of help. Someone recognized that my mother was in need and that I couldn't do it alone. It's still been a struggle since then and she's definitely had some very bad days where I had to go down to make sure she was OK. But we are slowly moving towards someone being there at least 4 days a week for some amount of time, which is more than she has now. This letter has changed my life, because it proves that someone listened. I'm no longer alone and neither is my mother.",3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYUCGWFA,3LOTDFNYA8LZN2BGZ2BVBTVYUCGWFA,0.0

The ceremony was short and sweet and then the party got started. We enjoyed a delicious dinner that was served family style at out table.  After dinner, the open bar really got going and people were ready to party and dance the night away. There was the standard father-daughter dance and the groom-mother dance. While I myself refrained from drinking too much, my aunt did not follow the same game plan. I looked over a one point and she was dancing with a glass of tequila in her hand. After a few hours of repeating this behavior, she got really sick and threw up all over the table. It was embarrassing, but in our family embarrassing is the norm.

It was around 9:00 PM, the usual time of her evening walk. The evening was beautiful and the sky was very clear. I tend to be a bit of an amateur astronomer and like to stargaze. On the horizon that I was facing I saw a strange object. It was a spherical shape and of a purple hue. The object began to rise and change it's color to a deep green. It continued to alternate between colors. The sphere began to move toward me but did not make a sound. As it approached my direction, it continued to rise. When it was directly overhead, I would estimate it at about 500 feet. It was about the size of a small private plane. It then be began to increase speed rapidly and disappeared. The speed it was moving at was astonishing. The experience was unbelievable. I told my wife and a couple other people and they seem to think it was some sort of experimental aircraft. Whatever it was, it was highly advanced technology.",,3LRLIPTPERVDWB0RZ8609HQC9VBAK7,0.0

These are words that caused a fully functioning adult and changed her into a child. A child who has to depend on everyone around her to keep her clean, to keep her healthy , to help her relearn to walk . I had a good life, great job, great coworkers or so I thought. In July of 2018 i started having symptoms of many things, none of which I would ever imagined would be a mass on my ovaries. I knew something was wrong with me, I did not feel like myself but I continued to do my everyday activities, going to my job, working out on my treadmill, occasionally lifting weights with my home gym. I was eating healthy and losing weight everyday, which I had finally gotten under control. One day I was picking up my car from the garage down the street and on my way home I thought I had passed my house. I literally had no idea where I was, and that was pretty f'in scary. I went to my PCP and told her I was no longer comfortable to drive. I had been driving everyday since I was 17 years old. I was able to work at home thanks to my employer but the more I worked, the less focused I was. I initially thought it was due to my vision, so i had my eyes checked. They weren't terrible, but I thought I would give my glasses a try to see if it helped. It didn't. I went on FMLA, never thinking I would have to go through what I went through. After 41 days in the hospital, undergoing a multitude of tests, plasma exchanges, testing for Lyme disease, I went to the rehab inpatient for 7 weeks. I had 4 sets of serial casts, fitted for my braces which I continue to wear everyday thanks to my father. I am finally in outpatient therapy and I should be happy as I am making some progress but negativity around me drags me down. I love my mother and my brother and sister but it seems I am never doing enough for myself. They don't understand that if I could do it I would be. I have started standing at the parallel bars, my knees pay for it later,but they aren't hurting in that moment. I got up on all fours,never thought I would be so happy to be on my knees but I could do it.. and that is what matters. I am focused on getting my legs strong enough to stand. Hoping for some solutions when I have my doctors appointments this week.",,3M0BCWMB8WI9ALZ0U0PZS34DG2SWB9,0.0

Prior to that, the owner of the company I worked for had made the decision to shut down the business where I had worked at for about five years.  As it was a family run small business where I was the only employee, I was not offered any kind of severance benefits. I was only informed that they would give me a month's notice before they closed down the business. As it was, I was unemployed for a good six months. It was unfortunate that during this time my husband hurt himself while working his restaurant job. He had to have a hernia surgery and had to recover for a good two weeks.  During this time he was not allowed any physical activity and could not work. At this time, I was collecting unemployment benefits, our only source of income, which did not remotely cover our monthly expenses and rent.  We had virtually no savings, and had mounting debt.  My husband and I both grew depressed and started to get into arguments over the smallest things, like the fact that his smoking habit was making a dent in my meager unemployment benefits, or my not wanting to get out of bed and look for employment because I was depressed.  However, as my unemployment benefit was set to run out, I had no choice but to go out and look for employment, even if it paid minimum wage and inconvenient hours.  I was scouring employment websites and Craigslist for hours every day looking for jobs that I had no interest in just so that I could put food on the table.  I was discouraged because I did not get any calls, emails or applications returned while I was coming closer and closer to maxing out my unemployment benefits. It was not look good for us.  Finally though, I managed to get a part-time job as a receptionist for a debt collector, a job which I hated and lasted at for three weeks before I managed to interview for a logistics job which I got and have stayed at to this day.",3M23Y66PO3TAXS1WE4YQKYF0V0I6S3,,0.0

I had the great opportunity to travel overseas and meet the woman of my life. I had been chatting with her online for several years now, we met through an online video game. As time went on, we found that we had alot in common. It started out that we just happened to be in the same guild for an MMO, called World of Warcraft. As a healer in my guild, she healed me when we did raid dungeons, because she was assigned to my group. There were times that we would privately whisper to each other and talk about various things in life during these gaming events, and we found that were very interested in what we had to say, and listen. It was then we I made the decision to ask her out online, not knowing to where it would lead later. We ""online dated"" for a good while, until she asked me to come see her in her country. It is very far away, but I thought, yes, I need to meet this person, so I decided to do it! Afterwards we set a date, budget, flight plans, etc. Then, I embarked on a 30 hour trip to see this person. It was a pretty good trip overall, but when I landed the airport was very packed and I felt overwhelmed how many people were there. I ended up getting lost there in the sea of people. I did meet her and her brother there, but then I had to go back into the airport to use the restroom since our plane was flying over the airport for some time. When I got back out, I couldn't remember where their car was, so I got lost until her brother found me again lol.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA40AQ6RL,0.0

The birth of my own children was monumental and shaped my life for the next almost 30 years. As my life went on, so did my comfort with who I was and how things were. After so many years, I knew that there was nothing that was going to change my views on life and me as a person. I was wrong. My daughter, Sarah, recently gave birth to a beautiful baby boy. This is our first grandchild. Let me tell you, there is nothing in this world that can prepare you for being a grandparent. It is an experience all to itself. The day started like any other, until I got the call. Sarah called to tell me that she was in labor and heading to the local hospital, and she wanted me there. I have never gotten dressed and out the door so fast in all my life. When I arrived at the hospital I found my baby, Sarah, smiling and excited to meet her son. On the way to the hospital I had images in my head of a girl who needed her mom to help her though this painful ordeal but there she was all smiles. As the day, and her labor, progress Sarah was her usual chatty, funny self. Momentary pauses during her contractions were but a semi-colon in her stories. It was hard to believe when the doctor said she was ready to push, Sarah had barely winced from what I know to be tremeandous pain. It seemed to happen in the blink of an eye. Sarah was calm and focused as she brought her son, my grandson, into this world. In that moment of birth I was not longer Mom, I became Grandma. Never did I think I could love any child more than my own, but I was wrong. Sarah was no longer my baby, she was a battle proven mother who I admired more than anyone. Though I was always careful not to spoil my own children, I found a yearning to give this little boy everything his heart desired. I had a new mission in life, to dote over and spoil my new grandson.",,3M68NM076ITYWD1JZFYLUOA48V36RC,0.0

We had been expecting this time to come any day now. Once it arrived, it was nearly impossible to prepare for! My wife was already in pain. I could see the look of anguish on her face. No amount of childbirth classes could prepare us for the real thing. And here it was! Staring us right in our faces. I quickly sprang into action. Jumping out of bed and nearly tripping down the stairs to start getting things ready. Or course it was the middle of the night, and everything was pitch black in our modest home. My wife was slowly making her way downstairs too, much slower than I. Before I could turn to help her on her decent, she let out a blood curdling scream. The baby was coming. And right this very second. I had no time to prepare. I helped her lay down on the floor and we both began all the steps we had been taught. At that moment, I truly new how powerful a woman was. Even though I felt her anguish remotely, I was in true awe. She was my hero as she brought our son into the world.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIE7VTNX4,0.0

I wasn't expecting much, as this wasn't my trip idea, but merely a concession to go with my friends.  At the helm of the floating idea was Diane, whom chose her dream location, Alaska.   She couldn't help herself either.  Stories of buildup of how amazing the trip will be was shared with the group, and she made no attempts to reserve expectations, and her reputation was now at a risk. After arriving, we relaxed for a day in the hotel, simply sharing stories and enjoying the restaurants nearby.  However, the day I will remember for a long time came the next day.  Diane was not exaggerating. The day started off on a cruise through the Alaskan waters.   On the cruise was the most fantastic sushi which made me feel regret that it was contained only on the ship.   Afterwards, noticing the pool empty in this cold climate, we took a swim, with a delightful contrast of the cold of the air compared to the warmth of the heated pool.   With some more time to spare before arriving at the grand finale, we enjoyed a game of putt putt, to which I ended with a +35 score due to a mixture of incompetence and alcohol.     Finally, we reached the grand finale, a large shelf of ice which calved before our eyes.   On the way back, we were even treated to the unadvertised sight of passing whales. We flew back the next day.  We will not soon forget our trip to Alaska.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIE55RXNU,0.0

At a point I  sincerely thought she wont go through with it cause the sickness really did got to her really. I was scared at that some point . but on the day of her death was the worst of all I could literally see the light leaving her body that was how bad it was. I had doubt she was even actually gonna survive it. My siblings and i were with here i can remember her telling us how much she loved us. she told me specifically to take good care of my siblings if anything had happened to her. at this point in became really scared on how we were gonna survive. a little while she started struggling to breathe  my sibling called the nurses to come help us.

I accepted a job with my kids school. I have been running an in home daycare for about 7 years now. While I love what I have been doing the days are getting longer. My kids are growing up faster than I could have expected. I was shocked when the school called and said they had a job they could offer me but it would only be part time. Now I am very excited to take on the challenge I really had to discuss with my husband if we could financially swing this. I make decent money right now but it doesn't allow me the freedom to just focus on my kids. This is a very important time in their lives as they figure out who they are and the type of people they will become. I feel as though what I have been doing worked for us while they were little but now they will both be in school full time, it is time for me to figure out what I want to do with myself as for as our future. I think working at their school has the perk of being able to work and being sure if they don't have school I don't have to work. We will have the same schedule  and be able to spend the one on one time I so crave. They are only little for so long and it is time to focus on them. I am very excited to start this new adventure. My family is excited and in only a few short weeks we will be adjusting to our new schedules. We can not wait to see what the future holds for us.",,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEYVSXN4,0.0

After a couple hours of sitting on the floor to avoid the bedbugs i heard the door knock. I sprinted to the door like a marathon and low and behold the person was there with a baggie of something. i had no clue if it was legit or if it had something in it that was bad but i was anxious so i took it and payed for it. i paid the man the money and went to the table to open the baggie. it wasn't the usually stuff i was working with but it looked pretty normal to me. i packed my bowl and went to town on it. it relieved all my anxiety that very moment and i felt very relieved. Only problem was it was lasting only 5-10 minutes when my usual stuff would last hours. So i kept packing and packing my bowl with this weird substance of weed or as i look back now probably the legal K2 Stuff thats horrible for you and all night just kept packing it. halfway through the bag I noticed i started feeling very weird.. I took off my clothes and took a cold shower but that was no help. I started laying on the floor gasping for air trying to breath but couldn't grab enough oxygen. My girl took me to the hospital that day and it was just an 'anxiety attack' but i bought the stuff to help with the anxiety. how could it have made it worse. since then i have been dealing with severe anxiety.,,3MAOD8E57RWQ0UTN7VQULHIEGOONXU,0.0

She is aware of my previous marriage. She encourages me to move forward. She forgives me for my past. I'm still with her today.

I was told I was on the verge of getting rheumatoid arthritis and would need a cane to walk with, I would have to be on medication my entire life, and that's just how my life would be. I was getting ready to accept it. I did not. I turned my life around. I am healthy, happy, and LUCKY.

I puked and had to leave the party because I was so sick. I spent all night on the toilet puking out the massive amount of sugar I consumed. This event hurt my confidence a lot. I had trouble sleeping for weeks after. At work and around other people I lost a lot of confidence in myself and began to withdraw into my own mind. Eventually I learned to move on. Use it as a learning experience. And try to gain my confidence in my self in other ways. I tried to take up other hobbies. Because when I become good at something my confidence rises.

His friends share a house and there was a room spare so he decided to move in. It was quite sad to help him pack, thinking that he wouldn't be living at home anymore.   That said, I was excited for him to start a new adventure in life. The most surprising part was helping him to go through his belongings to decide what to take with him. We found old books and toys from his childhood. We also found old homework assignments dating from 1st grade to 12th grade. It was a lot of fun reading them. Packing his belongings and furniture into a van took most of the day. My son was very excited but he also seemed a bit nervous. It was difficult to hug him goodbye but he promised to come back and visit very soon. He actually came back the next day! It turned out that he had forgotten quite a few things that he would need at the new house. He also found out that the washing machine didn't work so he would be coming home quite often!

I still had some things I wanted to finish, like eating my sandwich. This greatly annoyed my girlfriend because she thought I was just doing it to be a pain in the butt. We did not argue about this until I had come back from the store. All in all, we probably fussed about the issue for a few minutes before it seemed the issue had been resolved. I was wrong. Later on that night my girlfriend unexpectedly slapped me across the face and told me it was because of my behavior earlier. I was very shocked because this had never happened before. I did not react much because I was so taken off guard. She did not react much either. She just simply told me to continue watching TV and acted like it never happened. Later on that same night she proceeded to hit me three more times. This was for a different reason than the argument we had had earlier. I did not hit her back after any of these attempts. She apologized the next day, but it feels like this memorable and striking moment may have done something to change the dynamic of our relationship for the foreseeable future.",,3MMN5BL1W0Q82E19B5461M4ATM33MR,0.0

I know that I felt that I was part of something more and among people who were just like me. I was also happy to just be there with my loved ones and it was my nephews first time at a convention so it was really exciting. I was really happy when I got to meet some comic people who wrote on my favorite book Harley Quinn. Jimmy and Amanda Conner were some of the coolest people that I met that day. I got to tell them how much their comic meant to me and got to thank them for doing the great work that they did. I felt that they were really humbled people and it was so exciting to meet them for the first time. My girlfriend who is my wife now got to meet spike from buffy and she was happy about that and it was a good moment because of how kind the person was to everyone. We also got to get alot of cool items that we had not gotten before from other places so I felt we got alot of unique stuff ourselves.  But the one part of the convention that was a high light was getting to Meet Kevin Conroy. The line itself was really long and some of the people who were waiting were kind of rude especially one guy that made kevin take a picture of himself and was just pretty silly and embarrassing in the end. But I was just glad and happy I got to meet one of my idols growing up and just meeting them for a few minutes was just one of the highlights and moments that I would hold for myself. I had a great time and felt that because I was with my peers that I was able to enjoy it more. It was also more fun because of my family that went with me.

I think its pretty common for the boyfriend to not what to hang out with his girlfriend and her friends. She took it as a bit of an insult, though. She said insulting who she likes is an insult to her character. The whole thing was blown out of proportion. She tried to trap me with stupid questions like ""so if I get along with annoying people, you find me annoying?"" and things like that. About 15 minutes into it, I could tell this was going to be a bad argument. I didn't realize just how bad until later in the night, though. We were supposed to go to dinner at my parent's house, but she said she wasn't coming. She loves my parents, and my mom's cooking, so that was a sign of just how mad she was. Still, though, it was such a stupid argument, so I didn't apologize. I went to dinner and then came back. She wasn't there. She decided to stay at her friend's house.

I did not know what was wrong with him.  I called into work to tell them I had an emergency and would be out for the day.  I rushed bear to the vet.  I was so scared he is like my third child and I could not stand it if something happened to him.  When we got to the vet they took him right in.  I was so nervous but the vet was calm so I tried to be as well.  They gave me several meds for him.  The vet did not know what caused the episode so that has me worried.  It could happen again if I do not change whatever caused it in the first place.  I felt unsettled because I did not know if it was something he ate or if he was allergic to something.  What if the next time it is even worse?  I did not know where to even start to try and find out the cause.  I decided to take him back to the vet in a couple of days for a recheck and to talk to the vet in depth about steps I can take to make sure he stays well.  I hope the vet does not think I worry too much.,,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCID4M,0.0

He was being a jerk and other stuff was going on with him emotionally, I think. Anyway, I was walking with my friend close by to my building. This guy and the owner have known each other for like 25 years! They had been fighting lately. I guess they were kind of antagonizing each other. They're 2 old men in a really, really small town, you see. Anyway, they were in a fight, and when the owner saw me with me friend, he started yelling. He yelled that my friend was NOT allowed in my house (his property but I pay rent). He would NEVER set foot in there again. I was upset and told the owner that we needed to talk about this. I wanted him to explain to me what was going on, since I had no idea about their fight at the time. He shouted that no, he would not explain, and that if I hung out with my friend I am an idiot! He called me an idiot. Then he stalked off. I was so mad I didn't accept his (half-hearted) apology the next day, and then we were in a fight. I told him he can't just decide who is allowed at my house. He said he would rip up the contract and he didn't care. I thought about leaving, but after about 3 days we were able to talk civilly (my husband facilitated a lot of that because I was still angry) and we decided to stay. I'm glad we did! We were able to end things at that place on good terms, and move into a better situation. We are still cordial/friends with the owner.",3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26BCFUK2,,0.0

It was devastating to me because I spent the majority of my childhood with her. My parents had to work about 12 to 14 hours everyday. They worked at a restaurant so they were always tired after work and went to sleep right away. I did not spend much time with them, so my grandmother too care of me a lot. The funeral was large because she had quite a few children and all of them attended. My grandmother had a lot of friends too so it was nice seeing all of them paying their respect. I did not talk much during the funeral. All I could do was think about all the good memories we had together. It was nostalgic. Seeing her body in the casket felt unreal. I could not believe that I could no longer spend time with her anymore. It made me regret not seeing her much when I was an adult. When they lowered the casket down in the grave, I cried a lot because the moment was truly the last time I would see her. I just hoped she was in a better place now.",3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCJD4N,3N1FSUEFL6MQGGE0YQAMS19MXCJD4N,0.0

I met up with Elizabeth here in France of all places.  We grew up together in Chicago, and it's been eight years since I last saw her.  Despite that chasm of time between us, it's like we had just talked yesterday.  We still have so much in common, and I realized how much I missed her over these past few years.  She's just finished school and is engaged to be married. I told her all about Mike, and how we were planning our wedding. I think we talked for hours in the cafe today about our plans for our weddings.  She hasn't been back home to Chicago for 3 years, but plans to visit her family soon. So hopefully we can go visit some of our old haunts together when she gets back. I'm so happy to have reconnected with her. It was like a part of me was missing these last eight years, and now that piece was put back.  Tomorrow we're going to visit the Eiffel Tower together in Paris.  I can't wait!

There were a number of things that built up to cause this. I had been under a great deal of stress for quite some time. I didn't feel like I was getting any backup or support from my manager or the owner of the company. There was a week when it seemed like everything bad came together all at once. I was sexually harassed by an employee who exposed himself to me and had another employee accuse me of sexually harassing them. I also loaned someone money, only to have them disappear. This all happened around the time of my birthday, when I didn't have a single person to wish me a happy birthday. So, one day, I snapped and quit. I was unemployed for about three weeks. Finally, my employer asked me to come back. Things haven't really gotten any better, but I'm looking for something else. I am hopeful that something will come along and that things will get better for me. They haven't yet, but I guess there is always hope.

He said he was in town from London, and wanted to get together.  I thought this was odd since I hadn't seen him in at least 5 years since he moved to Europe for his job.  But I said sure, and suggested we go to Disney World as I had just renewed my annual pass.  When Billy arrived at my house it was like no time had passed between us.  We were back to laughing and joking just like we had when we were kids.  I drove us over to Disney World, and we set out on our adventure.  First we went on Space Mountain - I think Billy screamed more than I did.  We went on Big Thunder Railroad, and laughed like kids the entire time.  We went over to Epcot for a food tour - we both liked the Japananese food, and the beers in the Germany area.  We reminisced about the old times growing up, and our parents.  Billy shared with me that he still wasn't ready to settle down, but did have a girlfriend in London who sounded lovely.  We watched a parade, hugged Mickey Mouse, and even saw the fireworks show in the evening.  At the end of our day we drove home, and talked about making this an annual adventure for the two of us.  That was the last time I saw Billy.  A week after our Disney World adventure, Billy was killed in a car accident in London.  I still haven't accepted the fact that this was our last adventure together.  I would give anything to have that day back and re-live it over and over.",,3N4BPTXIO9EXBKEP5DNR9I26SESKUQ,0.0

Having seen it before, I knew he would like it. It's a great movie. So me and my wife planned to take him to the theater last weekend. It also happened to be his birthday, so we lined up a little surprise for him. He was already excited to see the movie. We got ready and hopped in the car. We drove to the theater. We walked into the lobby and got our tickets. Little did he know, we had arranged a surprise party for him. All of his friends were there waiting for him, as well as some extended family. He was so thrilled! We also had gifts for him and rented the little party room at the theater. After the movie, we opened presents and had cake and refreshments. Everyone had a really good time. Johnny had a blast and loved the movie. He was so happy to see all of his friends, and the movie was delightful. It was maybe his best birthday event yet.

The weather was cloudy and we met for Mexican for lunch.  I really enjoyed getting to meet them.  We started to walk around and then got caught in a torrential downpour!  It lightened the mood for all of us to get soaked.  Later we had dinner and drinks and relaxed even more.  It was fun to hear about my girlfriend's childhood and meet the folks who raised her.

The most surprising thing there was when i ran into an old friend that I hadn't seen in years from school. I believed this was a sign of fate. We both spent hours meditating there. It was a serene and uplifting experience. The views were gorgeous, and it was good to get the fresh air. There's a reason why it's one of my favorite places. I wish I could have stayed there longer.

Around March of this year she began to spend most of her either in her bed or curled up next to me on the couch. I attributed her behavior to old age, and the vet agreed. He could find no illness or injury. Over the coming weeks she became progressively weaker until she was unable to walk. Her breathing was increasingly labored. I delayed the decision for as long as I could. On June 22, I carried her, bed and all, to the car and drove her to the vet.  He agreed that she would not recover and felt that ending her suffering was the correct decision. Throughout, Ginger was as alert and affectionate as ever. This made everything more difficult for me.

He's been really into those movies and toys lately and so we thought we would surprise him with seeing the movie. My wife and I don't ever really go to the movies together, nothing good has come out lately and it's been a long time since we were teenagers going every friday. Nowadays, you can actually reserve seats and order food; you can get there 30 seconds before the movie starts, have your seats and have your food delivered to you. It cost almost $75 for the three of us, but it was worth it for him to have a fun day out. He really enjoyed seeing the movie with us, and had a blast seeing all the characters. In addition to the movie, I decided to have a surprise for him. He's been saying he wanted a buzz lightyear for himself, so I ordered one off amazon and hid it in the car. When we got into the movie, my wife told him someone wanted to see the movie with him. His eyes really lit up when she took the buzz out. He held him and sat with him through the whole movie. I think I even, at one point, saw him talking to buzz, telling him something about the movie. It was really one of my favorite moments. We have a younger daughter who wouldn't do well at the movies yet, but it really makes me think about how much fun the two of them will be together. Hopefully they will both grow up liking almost the same movies!",3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SJ6P72R,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SJ6P72R,0.0

I work for a transit company, and we provide the only real mass transit in my city. Recently we launched an exciting new BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) line. This route has been in planning for years, and ever since I started working here I've been involved with planning, tracking, outreach, etc. It was exciting to launch it, we had the news here, tons of people, 200 volunteers from the city, and all sorts of other things. We had live bands playing at some of the stops, a DJ at the transit center, and a ribbon cutting at city hall. The exciting part about this line is that it uses a fleet of full electric vehicles, they emit almost no pollutants, and are extremely quiet. There were some hiccups. Ridership was much higher than we anticipated, so the buses were going much slower than intended. Usually the buses will run every 10 minutes, the whole line should take about an hour and a half to complete a full round trip. The line runs North to South, and we were pushing 35-45 minute wait times. The buses were so packed that we eventually had to turn people away if it was too full. After the launch we received some complaints due to timing issues. We fixed those by adding more buses to the routes. Another complaint we had was that bus stations (these are center lane stations) were causing congestion, so we improved traffic light switches for bus only lanes, to minimize the time at each stop. The city was excited and came out in force, and it made all the hard work worth it. I feel like we dropped the ball in some places, but man we did our best, and I'm so proud of my team and myself. We did some fun activities that entire week, and we have some other fun stuff in the works. I can't wait for the future lines, we have two more lines coming in the next 4-5 years.",,3NAPMVF0ZX10WTY33ZOCZU2SU6X72A,0.0

It was one of the greatest days of my life so far. I wasn't prepared for the emotional impact that her birth would have on me. I am normally a fairly non emotional person, but that day I couldn't help it at all. I was surprised by the length of time it took for her to actually be born. I knew that it could take some time, but it was much longer than I had anticipated. My wife had to be induced and we were there for two and a half long days before she finally came. My wife originally didn't want to get an epidural, but quickly changed her mind once the labor pains really started piling in. The first time I got to hold my daughter after she was born, I felt instantly connected to her and my life felt more complete somehow. I feel like it also brought my wife and I closer together as we have shared such a majorly impactful event together. It was hard to watch her go through it all, but in the end it was more than worth and I don't think either of us would change a thing about it now. Our lives changed greatly that day and I'm not entirely sure that we were completely ready for the impact it would have on our everyday routines, but so far we have been able to adjust pretty well. We have become a good parenting team and our daughter is growing up so fast. I often think back on that day when she was born. It doesn't seem possible that it was so long ago already. She has changed so much in that time and is changing every day.",3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GDHJ8P4,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GDHJ8P4,0.0

Even though I have spent over 30 years of studying 6 hours per week to teach adults the one hour class, I still am taught new things by the Holy Spirit as I study.  I encountered something that I found to be particularly touching today as I studied Acts 1:1-11.  The passage states that the book of Acts is about all that Jesus began to do and teach.  By verse 11, Jesus has already ascended into heaven, but this is still the beginning of what Jesus began to do and teach.  Subsequently, he will use the apostles and others who are called to preach to continue his teachings to the world. The apostles have spent the 40 days since Christ's resurrection learning how all of the Old Testament was about Jesus.  They were being instructed in the knowledge they would need continue to teach others.  Yet, they had been cowardly, scattering away from Jesus when he was crucified (except John who stayed).  So in addition to knowledge, they needed power to behave differently and that would soon come with the new ministry of the Holy Spirit introduced at Pentecost, 10 days after Jesus' ascension. But, in addition to knowledge, believers were advised to conduct themselves in a manner that could not be criticized (1 Peter 3:15-17).  Their behavior should adorn them.  That is what touched me.  The word adorn is so beautiful.  Most days I simply dress myself.  Yet, when I was dating, I would adorn myself with some cologne and my best shirt to be as attractive as I could be.  It touches me that the scripture urges be to adorn myself with righteous behavior.  It also convicts me.  I have studied and have a lot of knowledge of God through the Bible.  However, I still battle with my sin nature and often I am not adorned like I would like to be.",,3NG53N1RLW50OE4SF2RU976GEB0P8R,0.0

We were supposed to go out and do something and instead she ended up calling, for the third time, to cancel. I just unloaded on her, told her that I am tired of being the only active participant in this friendship. She gave me a sob story about how she's just been too busy to spend time with me.  I don't know if that's true, but I don't care.  She kept coming up with excuses and never even bothered to call me and ask how I was doing. So we had a huge argument and we have been angry at one another ever since. I haven't really spoken to her, other than just to say hi in passing, for over a month. She doesn't even seem to care, which hurts even more.  I regret that we had such a horrible fight, but I don't think it was my fault. I think that she could have easily spent some time at least writing me. She didn't even bother to do that, she just ignored me. I don't know if we will ever be good friends again. The fight was bad, but the time since has been even worse. She hasn't even bothered to try to clear the air or talk to me. I did try to talk to her a couple of times but she never responded.

We spent quite a bit of time apart, angry at one another. At least, I was angry at her. I don't know if she was angry at me, because she wrote me a message recently. Actually, she tried to call me a few times and then wrote a message asking me if I was alright. I wrote back and let her know that I'm feeling alright. We talked for quiet a while and she did her best to mitigate any angry feelings we may have between us. We talked about the time that we have been apart and we even touched on the fact that we had disagreed at one point. We didn't talk, at all, about the situation that led to the hurt feelings in the first place. Instead, we talked about what we intend to do going forward. We talked as though we are going forward separately, not together. She was very nice about the whole thing, and didn't say anything nasty. I didn't say anything nasty either. We both just talked as though nothing had ever happened. We talked as though we were no longer friends, but that we now have a history together. We talked like we knew each other very well. I don't know if that was a good thing or a bad thing, but I know that it was some kind of an evolution in our relationship. We now operate as two separate individuals, not nearly as close as before, but with a history that binds us together. Throughout the conversation, I kept trying to find some common ground. I desperately wanted to feel as though I were as close to her as I once was. She didn't reciprocate on that. She made a point to tell me that she still considers me a 'good friend' but never offered any new personal conversation that would support that idea. Instead, she made a point to ask me some very general questions, being careful not to get too personal or specific. She didn't ask anything specific, but I could tell that she cared how I was doing. That made if fell like there is hope that we can still be friends.",3NKQQ8O39ZRPXE8FDW14557GO0ZDUG,,0.0

I went to the grocery store after class one Monday afternoon, and I had my school bag with my laptop in it sitting in my back seat. As I drove to the store I noticed dark clouds forming on the horizon, and I knew it was going to rain. Of course, upon leaving the store it began to drizzle, and by the time I got home it was absolutely pouring rain. I did not want to risk getting my computer wet, and I knew it would be hard to protect it since I had to carry in the groceries as well. I decided to leave my computer bag in my car for a couple hours until it stopped raining, but I completely forgot about it, and I apparently also forgot to lock my car doors (I'm sure you can see where this is going!). The next morning I realized my mistake and went to my car to get my laptop, only to discover it had been stolen! Panicked, I immediately called my mom, and she advised me to first contact the police, and then contact my insurance company. The officer who arrived was very kind, but unfortunately it had rained again that morning, wiping away any fingerprints, and there was not much he could do to help other than file a report. Shortly after he left, I contacted my insurance company and was able to get money back for the items I had lost because it happened on my property and was covered by my renters insurance policy. I was still devastated, mostly because in taking my laptop, the thief also took my flash drive with all of my school files on it, meaning I now have to try to get back all the files I lost. On the bright side, my previous laptop was rather old and needed to be replaced anyway, so I now have a much nicer computer. Having my laptop stolen is definitely an event that I will not soon forget, and it taught me several lessons. First, I learned to always, ALWAYS, double check that my car doors are actually locked. Second, I learned that it is critical to keep a record of the product codes for all expensive items, because without that number the police cannot give you back your laptop even if they find it.",3NJM2BJS4XS20HU5WE7ZBT2Z42LPCX,3NJM2BJS4XS20HU5WE7ZBT2Z42LPCX,0.0

I've always had a desire to help others and after discussion with my wife, I decided to pursue a career as a firefighter. In our city, the process to become a firefighter is lengthy and demanding; it can take up up to three years and begins with the basics: an application process which began in June 2018 and ended in August 2018, and a test taking procedure which took place in December 2018. As summer of this year drew closer, I was doubting that I would be accepted further along, but finally, in early May 2019, I was invited to take part in the next step: the Candidate Physical Ability Test (CPAT). Over the period of May 2019 to August 2019 I would be given the opportunity to take the CPAT and if failed, I could take a practice test, then repeat the test. In total, there would be three attempts at the test and two practices, as needed. I thought I would pass on the first try given my physical capabilities, but I was sorely mistaken. I could not proceed past the first event on the initial test. I went to the first practice in June which was more of a walk through, but at least got to see and feel out the other seven events. Three weeks later, towards the end of June, I had my second attempt at the test. I made it further, getting through seven of the eight events, but failed to finish in time.  I would have to wait six weeks to take my final attempt. Halfway through we were given our second and final practice. This practice, they let us do a full run-through. I made it to the final event, but could not complete it; only needing about 10 seconds of work to finish. Over the next three weeks leading to my final true test, I felt deflated. I told myself maybe I just wasn't prepared. ""There was always two years from now"", I would think. I went into the final test still feeling a lot of uncertainty, but I prepared myself by thinking of my future and my families future. This was it; it was now or never (or at least now or two years from now). I buckled down and pushed through; finishing the course with 38 seconds to spare. It was a small window, but a pass was a pass. I was extremely emotional after passing; screaming with joy and calling my wife right away. The rest of my afternoon and evening was filled with unimaginable emotions that will stick with me beyond the entirety of this process. I cannot express enough how excited I am to move forward with this stringent hiring process.",3NJM2BJS4XS20HU5WE7ZBT2Z6RGCPV,3NJM2BJS4XS20HU5WE7ZBT2Z6RGCPV,0.0

I flew into NYC, got picked up by my boyfriend that had driven out to visit his family several days earlier, and picked up my sons in NYC. One son lives in D.C. and had taken the train in a day earlier. We huddled into the car and drove to Cape Cod. As we settled into the condo, we decided to take the early ferry to Martha's Vineyard. It was a gorgeous ride over and we enjoyed the view. As we hit the island, we rented bikes and got a map. We spoke to a couple of locals to get ideas what would be good to see. We headed toward Edgartown to see the Lighthouse. We rode the beaches we Jaws was filmed. We also happened upon an oceanside restaurant. We had a late lunch on the patio overlooking the water. It had great seafood. On our way back to our port town, we walked through the historic Victorian cottages that were built in the 1800s. The village is adorable and some have been in families for generations. It is much like the Mel Gibson movie, The Man Without a Face. Families spend all summer on the island. We shopped a bit and headed back to Cape Cod. It was a wonderful time with family.",3NL0RFNU0G9YUMKAQ7W9WE4CIH0K4K,,0.0

So I hopped in my car and took the 7-8ish hour drive to the house and the adventure began. I got there as the second person, so for a  day it was just a few of us chilling. The next day more people started filing in and we went out to eat for the first time. The third day is is when things really ramped up as we ordered a huge 40 inch pizza and the bulk of the people that I connected with the most arrived. The next day we went to a pretty dope arcade as a group and the rest of the people that were coming arrived as well. We were in a packed house full with 13 people and it was crazy. People were sleeping everywhere imaginable. The next day, the 13 of us went out to eat, partook in some weed and played some video games like Jackbox and Smash Ultimate. We did so many little things like eating out as a cool kids group of us, went to a gaming bar, shopped at Wal-Mart at like midnight and just so many little fun moments I won't forget. People started leaving on Saturday, so we light off some fireworks in celebration. The last day I was there the few of us left went out to eat and then I took off to head home in the afternoon.

This time, I saw the actual text message. She was asking him when he wanted to come over to 'have a good time'. I was devastated. I confronted him, and he tried to reassure me that it was nothing.

When my work represents my person is very well done. I am the type of of boy that every detail has to be covered, nothing more and nothing less. I usually go beyond what people expect of me. These are the things that make me feel this way.  However, when something does not go as I want, or simply does not work out well I get frustrated, anxious, and drained. There are many things I mastered as a person but when I have my comfortable zone I get frustrated and lose myself. When you do things you bad never done before it requires more effort and more of me. In the other words, is going beyond what the person expects from you. Also, is thinking deeper than usual so everything can go as I plan. Therefore, is good to get out of your comfortable zone and try new things but I understand that not everyone has the capacity for a change as drastic as this one sometimes. it has helped me to make better decisions and work more with my emotions.

It was determined that one of the babies did not have enough amniotic fluid and her heart beat was indicating some stress with the mild contractions I was having. I began to panic thinking about all the things I had not completed that I desired to complete before the arrival of our twins. I was admitted to the hospital within the hour. I was hooked up to multiple machines and given medication to make labor move along more quickly. The pain became quite intense about 6 hours into this and I was given the option for n epidural, which my doctor stated was the best option in the event I needed and emergency csection. I opted for the epidural and when I was given the medication My blood pressure dropped so low instantly I passed out. When I woke I was surrounded by hospital staff and being given multiple medications. A few hours after this it was time for delivery and I succesfully and safely delivered 2 babies with no surgical intervention. We stayed in the hospital for several days. The twins needed a little extra help to ensure they were going to be ok with eating and gaining weight. Even though baby B was a footling breech delivery she was perfect and healthy. The hospital staff treated them like little celebrities because there had never been a natural twin birth in that hospital before and they were all in awe of the babes. The babies gather nuch attention every where we go. This has been quite a challenge for me as an introvert with a fear of small talk. Maybe someday when I have gotten a decent nights sleep it will come easier.",3NPFYT4IZDQKQ2C1KRDZVX9HXJ0XGQ,,0.0

They seemed to be yelling in a direction together, however they were yelling at no one. We continued working and tried to down out the yelling even though it was very distracting and was interrupting our work. As the group got closer, we started to wonder if they were going to target us as bystanders. We began to collect and discuss our course of action if this group were to get hostile. They passed on the inside sidewalk of the street adjacent to our location. When they had passed we resumed work as normal. A couple minutes pass and the same group, still angry, passes by our location even closer. They seemed to be making glances in our direction and this time were more threatening. We tried to ignore them until they were closer, then proceeded to alert our manager. When the group was closing in, my manager grouped some of us together for safety purposes.

We were doing some construction on a particularly busy road, so everything had to be done at night when we would not be disrupting traffic flow too much. It was a pretty involved job since we had to dig up the road to extend the sewers so that it would connect to the new apartment complex the city wanted built. It was job to stand at one end of the work area holding a sign to alert anyone coming towards us that the road was closed. Typically, this was a pretty boring job, and most people knew what was going on so they avoided the area anyways. This night however, was different. It was around 2am when I started hearing some really loud, drunken laughing coming from down the road. After a little bit, I saw a group of 6 rather large men stumbling down the road, walking towards me. The group definitely noticed me, because I saw one of them point right at me as they got closer, their laughter kind of quieting down and being replaced by some angry shouting. Our work site was completely blocking their path and they didn't seem too happy about it. As they got closer, I got nervous. I quietly signaled to some more of the crew to come over and back me up in case things got messy. As they got closer, I began to fear for the worst. It is not easy to reason with drunks, and these guys were big guys. They could easily beat me up if they wanted to. For whatever reason, once they were about 15 feet away, they stopped in their tracks, kind of stood there for a bit looking puzzled. We locked eyes. After a short delay, they turned right around, and walked down an adjacent street. I let out a huge sigh of relief, and we continued working through the night without interruption.",,3NS0A6KXC5U9VXCGL91KSIPSCTKGZJ,0.0

I checked literally 3 times that my eyes didn't deceive me, but there my friend was. At 6:30 in the morning, in the same gas station, several towns over from where we both grew up. I was blown away. I walked all the way up to him before I said anything because I just couldn't believe it was happened. As soon as I said something he looked right up and recognized me, and straight away we started talking and catching up. He hadn't been in town longer either - maybe a year - so we were both kind of dumbfounded to see each other at all, nevermind in such a random place at a random time. We exchanged numbers and it turned out he'd tried to find me a few times over the years too. We've both gotten married and he has a few kids. We still haven't actually caught up in person over a beer but we will do soon.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6PZ4970,,0.0

I have an oddly shaped uterus that has a wall down the middle, separating it into two chambers. This condition causes my babies to run out of room quicker than usual and there will always be a chance of them coming early. This was the case for both of my kids. Recently I gave birth to my second son and he was much bigger than my first which resulted in him coming much earlier. He had to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit for the first few weeks of his life and it was very sad and exhausting. He was too small to nurse directly at the breast so I had to pump milk every 3 hours, day and night. I had to stay at the hospital in his room if I wanted to be able to hold him at his ""touch times"" so I was getting, at most, 1.5 hours of sleep at a time, for nearly 3 weeks. The level of sleep deprivation a human body can handle is truly insane. I met some amazing people that also had babies in the NICU. It's really cool to see all the different family dynamics. There was a huge Amish family that had a baby there as well. I got to ask some questions I had always wanted answers to. It was a cool experience even though my memory is very foggy, probably due to the sleep deprivation. I am so incredibly grateful for the amazing NICU staff for accommodating me in every way possible.",,3O7L7BFSHFBPGTRFFANASK1Q5QJEI1,0.0

He had never been to Europe, and had not been on a plane since he was in the Korean War , and was shipped stateside after being shot in the knee. My Dad lost his Mum when he was just about to leave for Korea, and wanted to meet some of her side of the family in Cork, Ireland. The five of us siblings arranged all of the airbnbs, the transportation, flights and the itinerary for him. The highlight was to be meeting his Mum's sisters relatives, all still in Cork. The country is beautiful, with winding roads, villages, and brilliant green farmland. When we got to a little village outside of Cork, we met Norma, who was Dad's great grand neice. She told us we could spend the four days with her, and she treated us like she had known us all our life. Great home cooking, with eggs from her hens, bacon from her pigs, and vegetables from her garden. She had pictures of my Dad's Mum at different stages of her life, from infancy to when she left for the states in 1925. WE met lots of cousins, aunts, uncles, greats, all of them making us feel right at home. WE spent a lot of time just walking the countryside, as there were a lot of great paths to explore. My Dad still at the age of 88, walks six miles a day, and he loved walking through all the fields and lanes. My Dad's Irish family is very musical, and they had one night where they invited family and neighbors over for a sing along of familiar and unfamiliar Irish fork songs. One night we went to a local pub and learned firsthand what hearty drinkers our relatives were, Tons of stories were told, lots of laughing and quite a bit of cursing too. My Dad was overcome at times with all of it. Taking it all in was both fun and exhausting for him, but he was totally in love with Ireland and his family that lives there. My brothers, always a bit rowdy, had almost too much fun, but it was so great to just enjoy all this family had to offer us. Our plan is to take him back every year that he is still healthy enough to go. We already have about six of the Irish clan coming over for holiday in October. This was a bucket list trip that totally surpassed our wildest dreams for my dad.",3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6YND97U,3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6YND97U,0.0

He had always talked while I was growing up about how he wishes he had a closer connection with his Mum's family. He wanted to see the places he had heard stories about, and see his grandparents home, where his mom grew up. I decided it was now, or never to see this through. I talked to my dad a few weeks back and made sure he was OK with the travel arrangements.  He tried to persuade me not use my time-off from work on this trip. He said, ""Oh, I'm too old to fool with a holiday to Ireland! I can look at pictures of the place anytime I want. Seriously, go spend your time away from work at the beach with your family. Don't worry about me. I'm just an old man."" But I knew what I had to do. I told him, ""Dad, I appreciate that but this is important to me, and I know it's important to you as well. Please plan on having a small bag packed on the first Saturday in August, and I'll pick you up in the morning for a two night stay in Ireland!"" And we did! We enjoyed a nice drive along the highway and didn't hit any traffic at all. We were in Ireland within 3-4 hours. The first place we stopped was at a diner for breakfast and coffee. We made chit chat with the server and found out about the area we were in. She helped us find our way on the road to do a pass-by his grandparent's old home. It looked just like pictures we had back at home. We made our way to his mum's house and she had a lunch and tea ready for us. We spent the whole day looking at old photo books, and telling stories of the old times. I was personally so glad to get to join my dad on this trip and I know it also meant quite a bit to him as well!",,3NXNZ5RS1BJBWDJ2O83R9HA6YND97U,0.0

The most memorable part was reconnecting with him and getting to meet his 3 children, who he didn't have the last time I saw him.  I took them around the city and showed them a lot of the popular attractions around here. I think they were happy to get the super in depth tour, and got to show them things that other people probably wouldn't know about visiting here. The event was significant to me, because its important to maintain relationships with family. It was both about the past and the future to some degree. In a way seeing him again reminded me of several events from my past, and allowed me to remember some of those past events with him. Seeing him again also was positive because it sort of reignited our relationship, and we now have a bit of basis to build on to further enhance our relationship going forward. Meeting his family was very important as well. They are already almost young adults themselves now, and it was important for us to connect so that they knew who their extended family is.  We have already been in a touch a bit more since we last met. I am hoping we can keep the momentum going. The event overall was pretty significant for me because it put family in the forefront of my mind. It kind of reassures me to know that no matter how much time passes, or how far away you are, there is always an opportunity to reconnect with family. I'm definitely going to try to go visit him within the next year or two to keep in touch and keep time between us shorter.",3OCHAWUVGP6PSO8KAIYETP1AAJYKX5,,0.0

After a long, 18-month planning process, we finally set a date for May. When the day finally came, it was a beautiful morning in the mids 60s. We thought this was going to be the picture perfect day for weather to celebrate. By noon, it began to turn. I got a text from my future wife that there was a torrential downpour. She began to panic. I assured her that in an hour or so, the weather would pass. An hour came. The weather did not pass. As the rain continued to fall and the caterers in crisis mode, I tried to stay calm. This was an outdoor wedding. Didn't Alanis Morisette say something about rain on your wedding day? As guests began coming, the rain slowly and slowly lessened. Right at the very moment our vows were to be said, the sky opened up. The rain was gone. The grey backdrop and wind provided for a legendary wedding.",,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y73GYFAE,0.0

Recently my daughter broke a spot between her teeth. It needs to be fixed before it decays as this is her front teeth. The problem is that she has a fainting disorder, syncope, or at least that is what we think it is, but even the Dr. doesn't know.  I am the only parent my daughter has as her father was killed in a car accident. I am the only one who helps her through these types of trials. Recently she fainted when she was with her boyfriend. He'd never seen her do it before and it was frightening for all involved. I had to explain to him, about her heart failure when she received her MMR and her pacemaker and how it malfunctioned and had to be turned off. She is 17. He still loves her but now she's terrified. It happened to her again when she tried to have a dentist fill this same tooth, only worse. She passed out came to and passed out over and over, while her eyes shook and her mouth foamed. The ER could find no reason for it. Now I have to take her to a new dentist to get it fixed. My daughter does not want to be dependent at her age, but she has to depend on me, as I have to be with her when medical procedures are performed on her. She will try nitrous oxide this time, for her dental work and we're praying it works to help her remain calm and conscious for her dental work on Friday. Parents are important especially mothers. I feel needed and have to walk a fine line between giving her freedom to live her own life while staying there for her when she desperately needs physical and emotional support.",3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7VJXAF6,0.0

I finally had a few days vacation and I was looking forward to spending the weekend at the beach with my girlfriend.  I had been spending a lot of times stressing about how I was going to look in my bathing suit and thought that maybe a good workout would provide the necessary motivation and confidence needed to feel better. After calling my girlfriend and making further plans to go out and to dinner and see a movie I grabbed my gym bag and headed out the door. I called my best friend to meet me at the gym. We had both made a commitment to get healthy a few months ago and tried to be each others personal trainer and cheerleader. I arrived at the gym first and sat in my car imagining all the fun stuff would would be doing on out vacation. When my friend finally arrived we got going quickly. My friend jumped on the treadmill and, after stretching I started with the weight bench.  I was in a great mood. I felt stronger than ever and so proud of how hard I had worked at the gym over the last few months. I noticed my friend jump o the treadmill and signal it was time to leave. As they opened a water bottle I decided to push myself had in the last couple minutes. As my friend stood watching I head a small pop. It didn't hurt at first but I was curious what it was. Immediately  The pop was followed immediately with the most extreme pain I had ever felt in my leg. I knew I had made a mistake. I knew I had pushed myself to hard.  I saw the concern in my friends face as they tried to help me up. Why had I been so stressed about how I would look in a bathing suit? As my friend helped me into her car on the way to the doctor, I realized my vacation would be ruined all because of my lack of self-confidence.",,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1,0.0

His auburn hair, his blue eyes and demeanor drew me in. He had a smile that could light up an entire room. Boys like that tend to draw me in. I was doomed from the start. We started off just talking and getting to know each other. Comments on social media turned to texting, texting turned to phone calls that lasted for hours, phone calls turned into a friendship. It didn't take very long for this fledgling friendship to turn into something more. At first, I was really scared about how much I liked him. Every time we hung out, went swimming and talked, I knew that I was in trouble with this one. I knew that he would be the one to break my heart. I mean, how could he not? He was everything I wanted and more. I found myself in love really quickly. Summer seemed infinite, and made it feel like this love would never end. I began to think that he may stick around even after camp ended. Maybe we could make this work. Maybe he was the one.. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. We both agreed that long distance wouldn't work. It would be too hard, so we decided to end our relationship. It still hurts to this day, but I cherish every moment of what we had. Those memories are precious and will connect me with him forever. Memories are what makes love eternal, even when love isn't enough.",,3ON104KXQLIPPMERFLFCKPY77BI4WL,0.0

It wasn't just a simple injury either. This thing came out of nowhere and literally wiped me out. It happened shortly after a gym session which didnt seem like anything different. I did work a bit harder than usual that night but thats what I do to gain strength and improve my fitness levels. Later that night after feeling an odd feeling in my leg, I felt a crazy pop. It felt relived but then shortly afterwards, I couldnt walk. This was my righ leg and I was barely even able to press the gas pedal in my car to make it home. Pains and muscle spasms begin shooting throughout my entire leg but seemed to focus near the inner part of my knee. After making it home, I immediately began RICE. The next few days were literally hell! I couldnt shower, cook food, and could barely make it to use the bathroom. I lived in a basement apt as well at this time and definitely could not make it upstairs to leave. Not that I could drive anyway. Eventually I retrieved a set of crutches that made life so much better! However, I couldn't walk work nearly an entire month and am currently still recovering. Its been about 5 months since the incident. The worst part of it all is that I am a very active and healthy young male. I put a lot of focus on health and well being and understand human anatomy and physiology at a high level. So, without the use of a major limb really puts me in a strange situation. It has been an interesting experience as far as learning how to do things that I can't do anymore but I cant say that Ive been depressed or sad. I have definitely felt worried at times though.  I hope this eventually heals and I regain full mobility of my leg.",3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1,3OLF68YTNAN2GP8DYXF3T4Y7T6FFA1,0.0

We were having issues and I felt that she was withdrawing from me, most noticeably, in a sexual manner. Seeking out sexual releases, I looked to some videos she had sent me approximately 2 years earlier. After I played with the audio for my own liking, I realized that I was hearing a couple male voices and one female voice on a video that was designed for me only. When I asked her about it, she said I was hearing things that were not there. That is when I took a closer look at even older videos. I found one other video in which I heard a male voice. When I questioned her about it, she denied it of course. Then I went to even older videos, and I realized that she was watching something over and over and that those videos were made in advance of them being sent to me. Yes, I did ""tweak"" the speed and enhance the audio, but that did not affect the fact that I realized that she was watching a video. I discovered that she was watching the same video over and over as she performed a solo sexual act. As I became better adapted to settings that would bring out background audio and hard to see objects in a visual sense I started seeing what I was previously being distracted from seeing. I realized that the women I loved and the one I had moved to Europe for and waited for 13 months to marry after returning from Europe was not performing for me or because of me. When I looked closer, I realized that what I was seeing was her watching a video of a dog performing oral sex on her.  The woman I was to combat animal abuse alongside -- was in fact, an animal abuser.",3OONKJ5DKD515CQY3EYPB9RRE1MOBL,,0.0

Alex was scared, too. Some nights he'd wake up crying and get in bed with us.  We were all worried about the whole thing.  The day we went in, the nurses and everybody, they were all so helpful. They took Alex in and got it done in under an hour while we waited. Well, thank God, it's over now, and the results are good!  Alex's hearing is completely fine. We're all breathing big sighs of relief! We do need to keep following up with hearing tests every six months, for now. This is probably nothing at all, but they want to follow it just to make sure.

This is such a specialized thing that we had to take him to a children's hospital and hour and a half away.

When we got to the hospital he had to have an exam prior to the test, of which he hated.  He was already scared and very confused, he had just turned three a month prior and has no verbal communication skills so that makes this even worse.  We had to hold him down on the table in the operating room so that they could hold the anesthesia mask on him.  It was so hard to do and very upsetting to watch him because you could see the fear in his eyes.  Once he was asleep we went and got some lunch. Within 30 they were calling to tell us they were done with the test.  We went back to the room and waited for him to wake up and got the test results.  It came out normal and all was well.  We had to wait for a little while to make sure that he was not going to have any after effects of the anesthesia or any vomiting.  We were then free to take him and head home.

It was the first Thanksgiving I had with my whole family since I was in my early 20's. It came a few months after my mother had a stroke. I come from a fairly large family (3 brothers and three sisters) so it was interesting to have us all under one roof with our now husband/ and or wives and our children. It was not one moment of calm, it was total chaos and way too much energy for me. Especially the fact that I am a bit of a hypochondriac and my family and I were on an airplane for nearly 6 hours. Not too mention going to a climate that is much dryer and much more hotter and or coldrer depending on the time of day that where we live. I found myself feeling ill and just wanting to rest the whole time. Unfortunately with so many people in one big house there was no time for that. We managed to have an enjoyable time. We cooked together, watched movies together. The kids got off of their devices for a short time and actually played board games. I purchased my mom a champagne cake made by an award winning bakery (very expensive) because her birthday was in mid November. We were all very happy, and were appreciative that my mom is still with us. That week was the most memorable because it was a fun family time and I am not sure when it will happen again.",,3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLB5N4QL,0.0

She'd grown a tumor several years before and we were always happy that it didn't cause her any issues and she was able to stay with us. Then she got sick. She wasn't able to keep food down. She was throwing up even water. She got weaker and weaker so that she couldn't even make it outside anymore. We knew the end was coming and even though, since her tumor developed, we knew it would happen, we weren't ready to let her go. In her later years, she'd developed some anxiety and didn't like to be away from the family. So, rather than take her to the vet, we kept her at home so she'd be calm. We stayed with her round the clock, petting her and talking to her and letting her know how much we loved her and how grateful we were for her being with us and letting us love her. In the early morning hours a few days after she first fell ill, she passed away in our arms. She went peacefully and with us there to say goodbye. We prepared a spot in the backyard, which she loved to spend time in, so she'd be in a happy place for her and close to us forever. She has a nice spot that gets plenty of sun because she loved to lay out in the sunshine and just soak up the rays. In the spring, we planted wild flowers over her to brighten the yard as she had done with her presence before she passed. We just celebrated our first Christmas without her but she still has her place in all our hearts and we think of her often.",3OVR4I9USQ5K5PI53CG6S0GLGR8Q45,,0.0

My husband wished me a happy birthday but didn't take me out.  I couldn't understand that and I was really quite hurt.  Even at work I didn't get a cake or anything which is unusual.  Three days after my birthday my husband said we were going to our marina to spend the night on our boat.  He told me to dress up though in case I wanted to go out to dinner or something.  I thought it was odd but I dressed up anyway and when we got to the marina there were more cars there than usual and I started seeing familiar faces and realized it was a surprise party for me.  I can't even express the happiness I felt.  I had never in my life have anyone give me a surprise party.  It was my daughter who had planned it and to this day I can't figure out how they kept it a secret.  My co-workers were there, my family and my friends.

Since he was diagnosed, his condition has progressively gotten worse over time: he has difficulty controlling his bowels, suffers from poor energy levels, has difficulty keeping food down, etc.. He has gone to numerous doctors and has had several procedures performed, but his health has continued to decline. Still, he managed to remain mostly independent until sometime this year. Approximately 2 months ago, he had his first incident which required a 2-3 week stay at the hospital. He fell ill while at home and 911 was called to bring him to a local hospital. When I found out about the incident, I was basically forced to pick up responsibilities around my parent's home. This included picking up and helping drive my mother to and from the hospital on a daily basis so that she could see my father. It also included having to handle grocery shopping and basic household chores, such as doing the laundry, taking out the trash, and general housekeeping since my mother was frequently at my father's bedside in the hospital. All these sudden and additional tasks were a heavy burden on me because I had to juggle them in addition to my own normal everyday tasks. The incident also added an emotional burden because I now had to worry about my father's physical well-being while at work. I couldn't plan too far ahead in advance because I knew I had to be on call and be available whenever my parents needed my help. I was no longer taking care of my own affairs and I had to refocus my energies on helping my parents get through their difficulties before I could attend to my own. Since then, my father's condition hasn't really improved. Although he has returned home, I'm still on call at all hours in case he has another incident. I have had to take him to the hospital again on multiple occasions and his doctors say that he should be brought back anytime he feels unable to resume his daily activities.",3P1L2B7AD2BDILCAURNJPCNWFNDLOR,,0.0

After months of waiting I finally got called for an interview. It went well and the guy told me immediately my application was approved. A few weeks later I went to my naturalization ceremony. It was a very emotional day and I teared up several times. The ceremony itself was really unorganized and I was very stressed that morning. We arrived with plenty of time to spare but the parking lot at the venue was full so we had to park elsewhere. Then the line for security was insane. It was like going through customs at an airport! Then I simply followed the people ahead of me into another room because there was no signage or instruction about where to go! It was actually horrible. I am a control freak (I acknowledge that) and I felt incredibly out of control. By the time I got to my seat I was sweaty and stressed out. Once the ceremony started, that faded away. There were 1500 people there to pledge their allegiance to the US along with me and it was such a sight to see. During the ceremony the judge talked about becoming an 'us' instead of a 'them', and that now I was responsible for helping shape the future of our country. It was really a great speech that moved me. After the ceremony I went out to lunch with my father and my wife. We only went to Denny's, nothing fancy, but it seemed appropriate.

I couldn't decide between Italian or Mexican cuisine. I decided to eat Italian on a coin toss, and thank god I did; the table next to me was a young, beautiful women, crying alone. On her table was two dinner, with one plate being untouched. While I initially ignored her, her sobbing grew louder and louder, until I had to intervene. I asked her to calm down, wondering about why she was crying. Perhaps she set up a date and was ignored? ""I'm sorry that I'm crying. My fiance died one year ago from today..."" I was stunned at this response and asked if I could sit with her and comfort her. She agreed, and I canceled my order and held her shoulder. We sat there for 20 minutes, before she left. While I was happy to comfort her, she later entered back and gave me her contact information; she wanted to meet again. 6 Weeks AgoWe met again at the same restaurant, and she kindly asked for a kiss. I was initially stunned, but I brushed it off as a desire for her to pretend that I'm her boyfriend. She admitted that she was in love with me, and how I made her feel good after comforting her. I shared similar feelings towards her; she was stunning and beautiful. 1 Month AgoThis is our fifth time meeting up for a date, but this time, I have a special surprise for me. She has moved my heart in the last month, and I adore everything about her. Her voice is soft, her skin shines in the sun, and her hair flows like silk.

I finally decided to cash in some stock that I had and set up the trip for our 25 wedding anniversary.  I thought about it and chose the islands that I thought my wife would enjoy.  And I had one special island for me.  On Rangiroa 27 years ago I took many pictures of the black tip reef sharks, a very few with mine and many more with another person's camera.  I only had one that came out ok.  So I wanted my shark pictures.  We went to the airport early and took our first plane to Los Angeles and got on an afternoon flight to Papeete.  Our first island stop was Moorea, where we spent 7 days in an over water bungalow.  The Moorea of today saddened me because 27 years ago it was pristine and uncrowded.  Not now.  Next we went to Huahine, where we found the French Polynesia of 27 years ago.  Few cars and few people and absolutely beautiful.  I actually stayed in the same hotel that I had stayed in 27 years ago.  We had a great time there and rented a car to drive around the island. Bora Bora was our next stop and it was pretty much the same as it was 27 years ago.  It looks really nice flying in, but not so much on the ground.  We had decided not to get an over water bungalow there because it was too expensive.  But when we got there, we were moved into an over water bungalow at no additional charge.  We left after 3 days to my ultimate destination, Rangiroa.  We were staying a very nice hotel with our beach bungalow facing out to the crystal clear blue water.   Then on Sunday we went out to the Blue Lagoon where not only did I get shark pictures, I got shark videos.  I had tears in my eyes on the ride out because after 27 years I was finally going to get my shark pictures.  It was a rough ride, but we got to the blue lagoon and I was overjoyed. This was the trip of a lifetime and I only hope we can make it back one more time before we get too old.",3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,3P4MQ7TPPYYHMI1PZ9T35PRS5GLBBC,0.0

It was a freak accident but I couldn't even drink a simple cup of juice. The therapist says it's PTSD and at first I couldn't believe it.

On a trip out in Tahoe, I rented bikes along with my girlfriend and rode nearly all the way around the entire lake. We started on the North side of the lake, and geared up at the local information center to ensure we had the proper route. After packing up supplies and filling our water bottles, we began our trek in the early hours of the morning. Weaving through paths along one of the most beautiful lakes in the country was a blast, and we often decided to stop and take pictures on our phone to make sure we could soak it all in. We rode more than ten miles south through numerous towns and private roads along the nicely paved bike path, and then opted to stop at a local pizza place for a quick bite. To our surprise the garlic chips we ordered as a snack actually came out on a large tray, and it became clear this restaurant had a different name for their cheese bread. Both of us were shocked at first but ultimately happy with our delicious treat, which we devoured in a few minutes. Once we finished our drinks and paid our check, it was time to head back in the same direction we came to finish off our great bike trip. Before we finally pulled back into the lot near our car, we decided to stop for a few minutes on a nearby beach and take in our amazing views of the lake one last time. After numerous pictures and a few final sips from our water bottles we hopped aboard our bikes and rode the final few miles back to where we started. Despite being quite tired from such a long ride that spanned well into the afternoon, we both agreed that this place was an amazing destination that would be worth coming back to. Our decision to rent bikes also proved to be a great idea. We agreed it was the best way to explore such a great area that many people often speed right through with their car. We have already planned a repeat trip back to the lake, and I know both of us will be counting down the days until we can go back. Next time we will definitely bring our own bikes however!",,3P4RDNWND6SXR9D7TBY1P0EIJRLJIS,0.0

It was her right leg to be exact. She would occasionally brush it off and blame the fact that she was getting older as the cause. This went on for a few months. One morning when she woke up and got out of bed I noticed she was limping. I asked if she was okay and she explained that her leg was hurting worse than ever. I told her to call and make a doctors appointment and I would drive her up there to get it checked out. During her appointment, the doctor explained the issue and said she would need a minor procedure and the routine surgery to be performed would have her feeling better in no time. We met with the surgeon and he helped calm our any fears we had about about the procedure and did a fantastic job reassuring us that we should have nothing to worry about, it is a very common procedure. The day of the surgery they wisk my wife away for this routine procedure. They explained it would take about an hour and I would be able to see her after. A couple hours had passed and I began to worry if everything was alright. I asked a nurse for an update and she went and got a doctor who explained that there were some complications. They had cut an artery and bundle of nerves by accident, so things did not go as planned. I was horrified. The recovery process was much more entailed than expected. During this recovery she gained an infection from a small instrument they forgot inside her leg. They explained they would have to operate once more and they did so quickly. She almost lost her leg. The recovery process has taken much longer than anyone could have guessed. She now walks with a limp and has pain that is occasionally worse than it was before the surgery and this will continue the rest of her life. All in all this was a miserable experience.",,3P529IW9KZ7JC8ZHVO4T2IEIW5CLF6,0.0

We had been flirting and talking for a few weeks prior to that and it was nice. We decided to finally meet, it was nice. We went to IHOP for a nice brunch and to finally see each other in person. I enjoyed seeing her in person and knew it was real then. We sat down and had a nice talk with each other, gazing into each others eyes. It was right then and there I knew she was the one. Some people think that is probably creepy, but I knew. I have evidence to show it because we are married with a kid already. This was so awesome to think about and continue to right. I am one proud husband and father now. It all goes back to that day when I met the one. The one who set me straight and on the right path. The one who I forever get to hold.

It's in one of the roughest parts of my state and it's always nerve-wrecking going there. After drive twenty minutes I finally arrived to sit in a pool of jurors and wait for instructions. During this time I was doing work on my laptop and after hearing my number called I went to the courtroom with the other jurors to see if we were going to be called. After getting dismissed and sent back downstairs, I decided to purchase a muffin. It happened to be a banana nut muffin, unknown to myself. Instead of eating the muffin at the courthouse I waited until i was dismissed completely and on my way home to eat it. Luckily. As I arrived home I decided to eat the muffin, but after taking a few bites I noticed something crunchy. I thought I purchased a banana muffin, and soon after realized it was a banana nut muffin. I happened to be allergic to walnuts and didn't think twice about how bad it would affect me. After trying multiple solutions to get the nut out of my system, it was to no avail and I ended up calling my mom and having her take me to the hospital. My vision was blurry, my throat was closing, and I felt like I was dying and I was so dizzy. Once I finally arrived, they new to take me to get treated right away, and I was lucky enough to book a room at the hospital. They injected me with a few drugs and I was able to sleep better.",3PB5A5BD0WSQBN6A2E911YWT16O7GA,,0.0

We all talked about only having a couple drinks, but of course, most adults know that a few, means more than a few.  I ended up staying out a lot longer than I thought I would, drank way more than I really wanted to, and woke up with a killer craving, which of course, was hang over food.  I really wanted breakfast food at this point as well, so why not decide to go to IHOP? It was actually a 15 minute drive for me, as oppose to Dennys which was just down the street from my house, but for some reason, I wanted to upgrade to IHOP and I went with it.  I am absolutely amazed at how everything goes down, but it was at that IHOP where I met the woman that I knew I would eventually marry. I was sat down in a booth, that of course would normally have about 4 people in it, but it was just me.  Sitting at the next table, was this gorgeous, red haired woman.  Our eyes met, and she gave me the cutest little smile and looked back down at the newspaper she was reading. I waited, and was trying to get over how stunning this woman was, before I finally got up and decided to introduce myself and invite her to my table for some conversation.  She looked surprised, and asked really? Of course really, and I asked her if I could carry her coffee cup over, and she said yes and gathered her jacket and purse and came to sit with me.  We talked about everything from our careers, to our families, and even our heart aches. What was most surprising, was that she also was coming in that morning after a night out with her girlfriends who all were to hung over to get breakfast. We sat there for over 3 hours.  It felt like 15 minutes.  Not many people are lucky enough in their lifetime to make a connection such as this.  I thought she was stunning when I first saw her, now I just couldn't envision my life without her in it.  I thought I was crazy.  This is way to fast to have these feelings, or could love at first site be a real thing?  I don't know, but I wasn't going to questions it. It was not even 12 months later when I made her my wife, and here we are 15 months later, and I couldn't have found myself anyone else this amazing.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUASZRT2C,0.0

I had placed her car seat inside my shopping basket and we were touring the health food section. Suddenly my phone rang and an unfamiliar voice said, “This is your father’s apartment manager. There’s been an emergency.” All I could think was that my dad had probably been taken by ambulance to the nearest hospital or something. So I asked the woman, “Are they taking him to the hospital by ambulance? What hospital are they taking him to?” Then the woman replied, “No, he’s not going to the hospital. Your father has passed. Just try to get here as soon as you can.”All of the sudden I just felt overcome with panic. My hands were shaking as I quickly removed my daughter’s car seat from the shopping basket and hurried toward the car. I was amazed at the superhuman strength I had in that moment. You don’t really know what an adrenaline rush feels like until you’ve either been in a life or death situation, or at least experienced what your mind considers to be the emotional equivalent. I swiftly swung my daughter’s car seat in to the back seat of my SUV in a single motion. I drove with little regard for speed limit or traffic lights right to the bank down the street where my husband was working at the time.  When I finally reached the bank I swung open the double glass doors as quickly as I could. I spotted my husband sitting quietly at his desk. There were some customers waiting in the lobby, but honestly I couldn’t have cared less. As soon as my husband noticed me I spoke the only words that I could think of at the time . “Mark! My dad… My dad died.” Losing a parent is incredibly painful. Part of your identity dies. Nobody else remembers your childhood with the same sentiment. Nobody else really loves you as much as they did. It’s a really difficult thing to come to terms with. It seems inconceivable that someone who’s been there for us since day one can suddenly be — gone.",,3P59JYT76M6NURVAG2RD4QUAS5ET2B,0.0

I had hoped to catch the peak foliage; it always comes down to a gamble. Luckily this year I managed to catch some peak color, and even the trees that weren't at peak color yet were only a day or two from perfection. I made the decision to travel the back roads, and found a beautiful field, and while driving around trying to find a cell signal I found a beautiful lake. The trees across from it made for a stunning picture. I even stopped at a secluded town and took a stroll. I got breakfast at the local market; some fresh baked donuts and apple cider! Eventually I made my way to a local ski resort, which was holding its annual Columbus Day weekend events. The main event was a gondola ride to the top of the mountain to catch the panoramic view of autumn trees as far as the eye could see! The view from the actual top was slightly hazy, but the view from the gondola ride was picturesque! That was the highlight of my trip, as by the time I got down from the mountain the sky was clouding up, preparing for rain. I stopped at a local country store and a local farmer's market.

I have an old friend who lives there. The trip was grueling, to get across the Atlantic. It took me 31 hours to get there. I didn't sleep the entire time. But it was worth every second of anxiety and the lack of sleep. I stopped in Dublin and got to walk around the town and enjoy the accents. Trinity College was beautiful. Even just the streets and public parks were relaxing. The ""large city"" was calmer than the suburbia I live in. Then I made it to Tenerife and it was even more fun. The weather was PERFECT. The ocean was blue, and just cool enough. The vibe of every human was so nice and relaxed. Mojitos on the beach while swimming, couldn't beat it. Then we went to the top of Mt Tiede, a 12,000ft volcano! It was hard but worthwhile to see every side of the Island. Then we just hung on the beach every other day of the week. It was the most relaxing 10 days of my entire life.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG016WZS,0.0

She had not been feeling well for a good while, and after a visit to the hospital we found out she was in sepsis. This is a very serious infection of the blood that is very hard for elderly people to fight. I was in a panic. I was so sad and I had no way of getting down to Florida to visit her due to financial reasons. My aunt and uncle flew my mother down there and I had to sit home and wait to hear what was happening. My mom called me with updates throughout the week. As much as they tried to treat the infection with antibiotics, nothing was working. She was in pain and suffering. It was time for her to make a tough choice; stopping the medications that were keeping her alive. I received a tearful phone call from my mother telling me she was entering hospice care. This was grueling information, because it meant I was not going to see my grandma ever again. I was heartbroken. She passed away three days later. I was able to make it down to attend the funeral, and I've been very sad ever since. I miss her so much.",3PEIJLRY6UFGNO21ZWHHH0V5Z4VXWW,,0.0

While I had met people from the internet in person in the past, this was the first time I was traveling overnight away from my home to do so. I would be visiting them in their home in Ohio. I was coming from Illinois, another internet friend was coming from New York, and we were meeting up with the 3rd friend in Ohio. I was nervous during the drive to Ohio. I had never been in the area before, and I didn't know anyone else in the area I could turn to in case things did not go as well as planned. Luckily, I was the first to arrive at the house, and I was finally able to meet my friend Tam in person. We were able to hang out and feel comfortable around one another like we had been friends for years (we had only spoken online for about 1 year). Soon, the 3rd person (Judy) arrived and we all had dinner together. There were a few awkward pauses, but for the post part, the trip went well and we all had a great time. We traveled around the Columbus area, went to a few different malls and went out for food and drinks. We all stayed in the same house and spent the evenings cooking together, watching movies and generally bonding and learning about each others lives and experiences. Overall, it was a very fun and memorable weekend. We are trying to plan another get together, but since we all live in different states and have busy lives, it is difficult to coordinate and time and place. I do hope that we can all get together again soon.",,3PEIJLRY6UFGNO21ZWHHH0V5067WXC,0.0

She will be graduating in December with PH. D. in Urban Youth Development. To be a black woman of her age, with a full time job and a busy life ,graduating with a PH. D is amazing. Though it was no easy road and she admitted to all of us many times that she wanted to give up, she didn't. She kept pushing, sometimes missing nights of sleep and fun times to obtain a major accomplishment. She was convinced that the party was actually to celebrate the life of her stepfather, since he is old and not sure of how much time he had left to spend with his family. To her surprise, she drove an hour and a half away to be celebrated for her own accomplishments. The look on her face when she walked through the door with her cousin and heard everyone yell, ""SURPRISE!,"" was priceless. She broke down into tears of joy and was greeted by my two year old son who ran to her with open arms. She was greeted with hugs, cheers of congratulations. The program led celebration also consisted of opening and closing statements from family, friends, professors and a surprise facetime call from a classmate that was amplified on the microphone for everyone to hear. One her professors boasted about how she was the most quiet person in her class but one of the smartest.   My mother in law had her own photo backdrop with her name and school logo on it, a custom cake with her school's name, colors, mascot, and a graduation cap and degree. We also presented her with two custom made glass awards. We all ate, danced, cried, and had a good time in celebration of her achievements. She and I have come a long way in our relationship so for me to able to contribute in doing this for her and seeing the joy on her face made me fell good. It was an emotional  experience for us all.",,3PH3VY7DJMJ5SJ2G0E52ELBG5D5WZK,0.0

Also my son was there with is first cousins playing in sandbox getting all dirty. So were doing all this while the food is being grilled  so we could eat. Then after everyone arrived we wanted to do a balloon release in memory of my mom. We all gather on the side of house with our balloons and we prayed and said some loving things. Then we counted down and let the balloons go and watch as they float up to sky to see how far they would go. Which was really high without popping I felt like she was watching they floated all together. I wanted to cry but I held it in. Eventually the food was done so we lined up fix kids food first then ours. Then we all sat together and conversant and laugh.

That's why recent news of Mauna Kea emphatically hit me. Native Hawaiians are fighting construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope on sacred land. Unfortunately, it's an oft-repeated tale as ancient as time itself. As the traditional guardians of their lands, indigenous communities have tried and tried again to protect what is theirs, bucking against forces with systemic authority and deep pockets. And it's not usually the native populations who win in the end. What's happening with Mauna Kea is ""no different than what they did to the Native American Indians in Arizona,For the Native Hawaiians, it is not a question of faith against science. It's cultural preservation versus blind commercialism – the prioritization of capital over human interest. Located on the Big Island, Mauna Kea is not only an inactive volcano, but also the globe's highest sea mountain. For a decade now, international scientists have aimed to build the $1.4 billion project on the land, due to the absence of both light pollution and moisture in the air. Supporters favor the predicted economic growth with accompanying job opportunities. But the plan has encountered indigenous opposition every step of the way. At this point, thousands of Hawaiians have engaged in peaceful protest, blocking passage to the summit. Kūpuna, or elders, gather at the forefront. 30 elders were arrested at the the Mauna Kea access road as they attempted to block construction crews from proceeding up the mountain. They are not disputing technological progress, but pushing to maintain a sacred site of Hawaiian spirituality. Already the summit hosts 13 other telescopes that dishonor Mauna Kea's true purposes. Mauna Kea means respecting the earth. With its delicate ecosystem, the mountain and its endangered species face threats from human development, like habitat loss. Ultimately, it means native rights. So much social justice nowadays centers around finally giving indigenous communities – peoples with irrefutable historic connections to these lands – their duThanks to international media coverage and campaigns to #ProtectMaunaKea, the Thirty Meter Telescope announced a potential alternative to construct on the Canary Islands. But the battle is far from over.",,3PJ71Z61R5OXLR40ZSMI87JT6RD19G,0.0

It was my first real job after college. My family lives in Europe now so they were too far away to help me. I was getting so depressed and was feeling like I was failing in life. My best friend who lives in another state asked me if I would consider moving to another state because she would be able to help me and support me through this hard time in my life. I was so worried because the only person I knew there was her and I didn't want to make my problems hers. I really didn't have any other options so I agreed to move to Texas. I knew that they had a lot of jobs for engineers so I was hopeful to find a job pretty fast. Within a month I moved to Texas. It was stressful but my girlfriend was so supportive. She even let me stay with her for 2 month while I was looking for a new apartment and was sending my resumes to the companies. She drove me to my interviews because my car was not delivered there yet. It really showed me how good of a friend she is and this experience made us even closer. A friend in need is a friend indeed. This situation taught me how string I am and that there is nothing I cannot do if I set my mind to it.,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6197J98H,3PJUZCGDJ72FWROLYDVXNH6197J98H,0.0

I am not entirely sure how I have made it through this long. I am going stir crazy. Everything I have tried has proved to be a failure of the utmost proportions. This has made me appreciate things a lot more. I have learned better to accept what I have and not always be looking for something better. This shows me that where I am and what I have can be enough, stop constantly be on the look out for upgrades. I have now seen what I can get by with if I do not completely adopt the consumer culture so many of us have embraced. When you actually live on the things you need, you realize all of the stuff you spend money on that could be better spent elsewhere. Imagine the time I could have if I did not need to work all the time. This makes me realize I should save more so I can retire early. I need to enjoy more of my limited time. I need to be the with people that I enjoy, not just working constantly. I need to work to live, not live to work. I am definitely embracing this new outlook. When I find a job, I am going to be picky and do something that fits me. I will not just take the first thing or the best paying.

I found out by chance. What was making it even worse was that it wasn't the first time he was cheating on my mother. Also, the woman he was involved with was in her early twenties, so she was younger that my little sister. I felt horrible and truly disgusted with him. I didn't know what to do. I decided to speak with my sister about it and it turned out that she was suspecting him for a couple of months.  After talking for hours we decided against telling our mother, because her mental state has been very fragile for the last couple of years. We decided that we would confront our father though. When we did he denied it and lied to our faces over and over again. He claimed that the woman was just a good friend of his and was helping him with a new business venture. He even got frustrated that we don't believe him. Both my sister and I are a 100% certain that he was lying and that he was cheating on my mom. I am not sure if after we confronted him he had put an end to the affair or it is still a thing. Honestly, I think that it would be much better if my mother had divorced him the first time she caught him cheating, while we were still kids. She could've been so much happier without him.",,3PPTZCWALR608M6UO56WMWTUTZ9ZQQ,0.0

We didn't have too much time to get things together because my friends gave me really short notice. The birthday party was supposed to be a surprise, and I think we did a good job keeping it that way. His wife might have clued him in on the party, but even if so, he still acted surprised. I got to meet some really interesting people at the party that I had never interacted with before. Most notably was my sister in law's friend, who was full of energy. Even though I was exhausted from working a long shift, his energy was contagious and it really pepped me up and I was able to enjoy myself and have a great time with my loved ones. We had a caterer for the party who did quite a nice spread, with all kinds of food. I was adamant about there being vegetarian options, because I know a lot of people who might attend were vegetarian. Sometimes you go to parties with food and it's all meat, or just really boring stuff. But this caterer was particularly fancy, and we got a great deal because the lady who owns the business is a friend of mine. I overheard a lot of people talking about how great the food was. My brother got some really silly gifts. The most memorable was a teddy bear onesie. His friends made him put it on for the remainder of the party, which was really hilarious.",,3PQMUDRV7SS1WYT1BTD1DZZIMO2IIP,0.0

She lives a couple of states away and I hadn't seen her in many years. Last October grandpa died and by his request he was cremated and had a memorial in the spring. We didn't get to go because we couldn't get time off work. While we were up there though we went to his grave site, which is in a veterans memorial cemetery. It's a nice place and looks well taken care of.  I was nervous about seeing grandma for the first time in over a decade. I just never got the chance to go up there. My parents took a couple of trips but I couldn't get off work and stayed behind to watch the house and dogs. Anyway I was worried that I wouldn't remember much about her or the house but it all came back to me when I got there. They have a basement with loads of neat stuff. Grandma still does a lot of craft type things. It turned out she remembered less of me being there and didn't think I had been there for an even longer time. We went to see her brother and had a formal dinner which I was not prepared for. I was under dressed and felt out of place, which was a little awkward. But they were nice and it was a decent time.",3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NGXPOAA4,3PQ8K71NHY67KYR5NHTBF3NGXPOAA4,0.0

I've been out in San Francisco a lot lately to help take care of my 97 year-old grandmother. She lives with my aunt, but she's needed a little extra support lately. Anyways, I had been out there for over a month and was really missing my friends back in Colorado. I had made a joke to my friend Dani that we should rent an RV and drive the Pacific Coast Highway (PCH). There was some other family coming to my aunt's house who I really didn't want to see. Out of the blue, Dani called me about a week before the relatives were flying in. She declared that she had some cancellations and wanted to fly out and do the road trip. She booked her ticket that day. Once she flew in, we picked up the rental van (an actual RV was too expensive to be practical) and we were off! We started in San Francisco with a quick driving tour of the city, then we hit the PCH. We stopped at funky tourist attractions along the way like the Mystery Spot and a tiny Big Foot museum. We didn't plan anything; instead we just found places to stay as we went. If we liked the town, we stayed the night, if not we went to the next one. There were gorgeous views all along the rocky coastline. We took 2 days to drive down to Los Angeles and then we took 2 days to drive back to San Fran. I really enjoyed out time together and appreciated that she was able to come out. Plus the drive was a first for both of us which made it even more special.",,3PS7W85Z80OYUBG91B6SED2OY3JT9I,0.0

Pets are family and should be treated as such.  A friend gave us Maggie when my children were 3 and 5. I was a single parent at the time and she was a great addition to our little family. She was just a kitten and loved to play. Maggie grew up with  my children. When I started dating my current husband he ""hated"" cats (so he said).  A few years later, my kids and I were set to move in with my then boyfriend (now husband). The deal was to have Maggie fixed and declawed and she would be fine to come along.  My children are now 21 and 24. They never knew life without Maggie.  She played with us and gave us tremendous joy. We all loved her, even our dogs.  Now she's gone and I miss her.  We buried her in the back yard and planted flowers on her grave.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFRK312D,,0.0

I started a from home bakery about a year ago and have been blessed with a lot of business but mostly smaller cakes. I agreed to take on a large three tier wedding cake this summer. This is by far the largest cake I have ever made. This cake was also to be square which is a difficult shape to maintain on a cake because you not only have to get your icing smooth but you also have to keep your corners sharp. I was so very nervous about making and setting up this cake. The morning of the wedding I was already a nervous wreck. We received a phone call at about 4 that morning saying that my father in law had had a stroke and was in the ICU. I contacted the brides sister in law who was handling all of the plans and and spoke with her about the situation. I packed up all of mine and my 2 small kids stuff for a weeks worth of clothes and snacks to make the 4 hour drive. I packed the cake unassembled in my car and went to the church. I was able to manage watching my 2 little kids and set up the wedding cake without any serious issues. The bride was very happy with the cake.  The cake looked wonderful, I got a bunch of good pictures to post on my business page which was very helpful to me. I then got my kids and myself squared away in the car and made the 4 hour drive to my in laws home.",3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFPWF12B,,0.0

The benefits and vacation time were good and to top it all, I am able to travel to many places as part of my job. I felt everything has fallen in place for me and for the first time in a long time, I was on top of the world. Everyone was happy about me obtaining the job and able to afford to eat at fine dining restaurants, drive a very nice car, stay at the finest hotels and take my family to places they never thought they will see. My husband and I were pulling close to 300,000 a year with both incomes and to me, life was grand. I wasn't stinking wealthy but I were living great. I talked about my experiences often with friends, showing off places  my family and I went, snapping pictures of wads of cash with captions here and there. Some noted as 'haters this could be you too!' The places I used to frequent with friends became less and less and I somehow found myself not exactly on the same levels as my friends anymore.  I noticed I here less and less from each of them as time passed.  Initially I did not think much of it until one day a long time good friend of mines wanted to have serious chat. She noticed a change of attitude with me and said I was not the same as woman she used to know. I had the tendency to humble brag a lot and seem to distanced myself away from everyone else. Other friends thought the same but fear upsetting me. I felt a bit shocked about  how everyone felt and I apologized if I allowed my job to change who I were. Unfortunately that friend and I is no longer close like we used to be and a few others left my life too. I felt horrible about the outcome and made a conscious decision to humble myself. What comfort me is everything happens for a reason and a lesson to be learn is to not only be grateful but towards close to me ands not allow superficiality be a theme of my life.",,3PW9OPU9PR6ML7J1EJ73YKBFG9W21A,0.0

Late last year, after years of dealing with her dementia-ridden husband, she put him in a care home. Then in March of this year he passed away. During her time caring for him, her mental and physical health seemed to suffer. After she put him in the home, she did better. It was a bit of a relief when he passed away, and I hoped she would improve. That didn’t seem to be happening. One day I couldn’t get a hold of her all day, and I feared the worst. It turned out she was fine but had accidentally turned off her cell phone. At that point I realized that I needed to move in with her. She needed someone to help her out a bit, and I needed the peace of mind of being with her. So within the span of a few days I decided to move in with her and then did. It was a difficult thing to do for me. I had lived by myself for over fifteen years. I wasn’t used to living with someone else. On top of that, there were the ego-related feelings of being a pathetic adult living with his mother. I knew it was for the best for my mother, so I just had to deal with the negative aspects of the situation. She thinks its great and perfectly natural, while I think it’s a necessity and unnatural.  It has been two months now and it is going reasonably well. My friends all understand and even encouraged me to move in with her. I still feel weird about it and I still miss my independence. But I do not miss the constant worrying about her and what she is up to. I’m doing what I need to be doing right now. There should be plenty of time for me to live on my own again sometime in the future.",3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRERBUQ51E,3Q5C1WP23NNEK42OW291WRERBUQ51E,0.0

I was very proud though and pleased with the gift. It helps relieve some of the student debt I incurred. My wife also returned to school around the same time I did.

I have finally graduated from college and received a Bachelors degree in Accounting.  It took me five long years to complete that degree. Two years in community college and another three years in the CSU system. I had to fight hard for all the classes as registration filled out very quickly on enrollment dates.  For the first time I was able to see the light at the end of the tunnel. All my hard work paid off and I can finally say I have a accomplished one of my biggest goal. It was my graduation year and I felt very happy about it. My family and friends showed up to celebrate my big accomplishment. My significant other also came along to celebrate such a big event. They brought me thoughtful gifts and colorful flowers. We went to dinner with the whole family. They showered me with love and appreciation, which is what mattered the most.  From that day, I was ready for the real world. I was happy I concluded an important chapter in my life.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZM8X58C,0.0

I'd been living paycheck to paycheck, and despite all the Dave Ramsey videos I've seen, I never put away any money for an emergency. When my dog got sick, I ended up spending about $5,000 at the vet. When rent came due, I asked my landlord to work with me, but he was a jerk about it and kicked us out.  That is when I found out what a true friend is. I ran into an old highschool friend Mary and her boyfriend. They offered me a spare room that was connected to their garage. It's not half bad. My dog and I have our own space, and my friend isn't charging us rent. Now I have a chance to save up some money and get that emergency fund going!  I don't plan on finding myself in this position again. I do know that no matter what happens in life, Mary will always be a friend of mine.  I'm pretty sure Red, my dog, feels the same way.

I nearly immediately got a job, had an apartment, was doing pretty alright. Ended up losing my apartment and did not particularly know what to do. Luckily, a friend lived in the area and I started staying with them. It was difficult to get to work. One day, the car got a flat and I was not able to get to work. I did not / could not be too much of an imposition, so this was a major loss for me. I ended up developing an infatuation with my friend's roommate, but was unsure how long things would last seeing as he was moving out of the area fairly soon. After he left, I soon had to leave too.  I would help out, was not getting paid and really had no place to go. I slept in my car for a while, which was fairly terrifying. I would go on walks among the redwoods in the morning, work during the day and hang out with friends in the area. Everything was alright, but fairly terrifying and full of doubt and mystery. I eventually ended up moving in with my beau, and am hoping to get even more on my feet.

It was such a long journey, but really this is just the beginning.  After my husband moved to America and we went through that whole ordeal of getting his green card I knew it what it would be like getting my visa, I'm glad that's finally over.  Eleven long months of applications and waiting to finally get my visa, but it was worth the wait.  I can't believe that we're actually moving to Australia.  I know it seems weird that my husband would move to America, just for us to both move over to Australia a year later.  Honestly it just seems like the whole situation will be better once we get over there as long as we don't get burned up by the fires, lol.  We began shopping for houses a few weeks ago when we felt like my visa would be approved, but we're still not quite sure where we're going to move to exactly.  I think somewhere along the east coast, because I'm pretty sure there's not much else west of that.  Speaking of learning I might need to get a book or something.  I don't even know what kind of money they use, and I just realized I'll have to learn to drive on the other side of the car and the other side of the road.  This whole move seems like a daunting task but I know it'll be worth it.  Even the kids are excited to go.  They think they'll get to have a crocodile as a pet!  Not sure how I'm gonna let them down on that one, but they'll have a lot better experience growing up there.

Not like oh my knee is sore pain, but ouch I don't know if I can walk pain. I tried to tough it out for a few days but it was no use, I had to have it looked at. Getting in to see the doctor was the usual trouble, call to book an appointment, nothing open for a while but finally I did. After a brief examination the diagnosis was clear: I had a knee injury and would need surgery. After a few more doctor visits for examinations, meeting the surgeon, discussing the procedure, the day finally came for the surgery. I went in for knee surgery in January. After being admitted and put in a gown and bed, the last meeting with the doctors took place. At the end of it the anesthesiologist asked a series of questions just as final confirmation. ""Are you allergic to any medications?"" No I replied. ""Do you have sleep apnea or any breathing disorders."" No I don't I said, thinking that I had already wrote this all in a questionnaire. ""Is there any possibility that you could be pregnant?"" No I am not pregnant I said. ""This is very important though, is there ANY possibility that you could be pregnant?"" Hmm I thought. I didn't feel pregnant, but then again I had never been before, how would I know? So I said ""yes, it's possible I suppose, what does that mean?"" I'll tell you what it means. It means that your knee surgery gets postponed while they administer a pregnancy test. It means they have to do a second test, and then a third one to confirm. It means I went for a simple surgery and instead found out I was 5 months pregnant. It turns out that they couldn't do the surgery when I was pregnant, the danger to the fetus was too great. My surgery was cancelled. After a closer examination of my knee they decided the problem with my knee could wait a few months for surgery, or may even resolve on its own with physiotherapy. But there was one complication of my knee problem that none of us ever expected: I gave birth to my son in May.",,3Q5ZZ9ZEVP1WV4M9VNIGB11ZP0X852,0.0

It was very refreshing to come in from a very fun activity and eat.  We were so hungry , no one said a word as kids and wife were eating.  We had our burgers and hot dogs with the usual condiments , chips, fruits, water, and soda.  We simply relaxed and enjoyed the ocean breeze come through the gazebo.  It was a nice Florida summer day.  No work, no school, no worries.  Afterwards , we road our bike in the park.  We biked along the dirt roads that led inland to another part of the park,  In one of the ponds, we spotted turtles and alligators basking in the sun,  When we got back, we took a little nap under the gazebo before heading home for the afternoon.

It was filled with high highs, and low lows. Even though summer only ended 2 months ago I feel like it has been weeks and years since I was out in nature enjoying the beautiful weather and wind blowing on my face. One of my fondest memories this past summer was something that I saw outside my window. I peeked out of the kitchen window and looked out to see a rainbow in the sky. After enjoying the rainbow for some time I noticed there was a nest build on my window sill. I cannot believe I almost missed this beautiful sight. The mother bird was a rare shade of pink I have never seen before in nature only in the zoo. But the most majestic part of this experience was the eggs that laid peacefully still in the nest. The eggs were the bluest shade of blue I had ever seen before. I never pictured that a pink bird could lay such beautiful blue eggs. The mother bird was always so attentive to the nest and watchful over these eggs. Just before I left for holiday I saw an egg begin to crack. I unfortunately never got to see the birds hatch. I only wish I could have been there to see their birth and watch them fly off into the world. This was such a rare memorable experience I doubt I will ever get to see again.",,3QAVNHZ3ENQOGHI9K8I1OH3RA9RALP,0.0

She bought draino , which is NOT toilet safe , and should not be mixed with ANYTHING else.  Well she came home and dumped an entire bottle of draino in the toilet and created a toxic gas , basically mustard gas according to poison control. Decided to go smoke a cigarette while the entire house filled with the chemical fumes. I ended up taking them both to the ER for breathing issues.

It all started with my parents. They originally decided to move to Texas in 8 months and we planned around that date. However, at some point they decided that they had to move sooner. They said it was because of an offer they got on their house and they really didn't want to miss the opportunity to sell above market value. The problem is this was a very difficult position for me because I was budgeting to have enough money to move in eight months. When they moved up the date, I began panicking because I would not be able to afford to move to Texas with them and I would have no where to live if I stayed here. The whole situation turned out to be a really big strain not just on me but on my relationship with my parents. Having no choice but to move with them in a month and a half turned my life upside down. I turned to a friend of mine who I knew I could trust and I asked them what I should do. My friend told me I should make a decision based on reason and logic. He suggested I write down a list of all of the options I have and the pros and cons of each. That way, I could visualize the problem and have a better chance of making the right choice. By approaching it like a math problem and adding up the option with the most pros, I was able to make an informed decision. Even after using this strategy, I still took several nights to sleep on my decision just to make sure it was what I wanted to do. In the end, I decided to move with my parents and leave everything behind for a fresh start in Texas.",,3QFUFYSY9Z1NE0SWPW5CG1C72DE4F9,0.0

The first month was heart wrenching. Every time I look around I see a shadow of him everywhere. I missed him tailing me wherever I go. With a sinking heart I took out the batteries of the laser light, he loves chasing the red dot. What still trouble me was that I did not realized how much an impact we have on each other. Little did I know then that he was part of my world, but I am the world to him. It is when he tore my bedsheet and shredded only on my side of the bed that I realized that he was actually trying to dig for me. He could not understand why I left him for five weeks, which would almost be half a year in cat’s years. It was uncanny, my comforter looks unruffled but underneath, you can see the torn bedsheet. When I pass by a cat on my walks, I always made eye contact and think about Ashton. He was incredibly smart. I totally missed him at the window going out to work and his goodbyes and greetings at the garage door downstairs. I thought we might get another cat one day. Not now, I am still sad. I do continuously read about cats everyday on my iPad, and look at animal shelters online. I also check out Craig’s list periodically. I love and missed Ashton and where he goes a part of me goes with him.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXIVELBV,,0.0

It was a little over an hour drive, so we left early in the morning so that we could get there right when the park opened. we stopped at a fast food place to get breakfast that we could eat on the way. we ended up getting lost because the gps on my phone was confusing, but it only took an extra ten minutes to fix. once we got there, we decided not to pay for parking, so we parked further away and walked to the park. luckily it was all downhill. when we got to the entrance, we wasted about 10 minutes in the wrong line because it was busy and we got confused. once we got in, we went to the bathrooms and then decided where we wanted to go. i tried to be fair and make sure that we took turns deciding on what to do, so that everyone was able to do something they liked. we went on multiple water rides, and i waited outside roller coasters with the bags while the others went on them. we got rained out kind of early, so we went on an indoor ride to wait out the rain. it was super fun. we also went on a kiddie water ride; i guess our boat was too heavy because we ended up getting stuck in the middle of the ride and had to push ourselves out. it was hilarious, though. we left about 30 minutes before the park closed; walking uphill to the car was not fun for my asthma and i had chest pains most of the ride home. we also took a different road, so we ended up driving through downtown pittsburgh, which was somewhat stressful for my husband. we had to pee, so we stopped at this gas station once on the interstate, and i kid you not the bathroom was disgusting. i felt like i could get diseases from it, and i've used alot of dirty bathrooms. it was creepy. but all in all, it was a fun day.",3QHK8ZVMIN4TZRN1QMIXJSNXGEMLB3,,0.0

This was my second child but the first time I carried a boy. His birth was so memorable to me because up until that point, I was sort of disconnected from my pregnancy, as I was going it alone as a single mom. I remember arriving to the hospital that morning. I met with my midwife and she sat down with my daughter in the waiting room as I went in for my surgery. My doula met me in the post-op room, and we spent awhile there talking with the surgeon about what I could expect. As they brought me into the room, I remember the brightness and 'holiness', if you will, of the operation room. I sat down on the cold table and the anesthesiologist came to prep me for my spinal. That was the moment I lost it and began to cry. Not because it hurt, but because I was about to meet my son. It felt surreal. I was given the spinal and immediately laid back on the table so the medicines could kick in. They draped a curtain over my stomach and I began practicing my breathing techniques I had learned for the home birth I had originally planned to have. My son was breech up until 41 weeks, and although I did everything I could to get him to turn, he remained the 'wrong' way and I ended up scheduling my c-section. I felt so calm. The complete opposite of how I had expected to feel as I lay there, about to be cut open. The smell of burning flesh hit me. I felt a bit of tugging as I deeply breathed in and slowly out. I looked at my doula and asked her if they had started it yet. She smiled at me and said ""He's almost here."" A minute later I heard a loud cry, and I broke out of my trance and began to cry myself. He was here. They came around the curtain with him and my first thought was how beautiful he was with his little wrinkly forehead. I couldn't wait to hold him. I was just so happy.",,3QIYRE09Y43IAT8U025NQ8EDZMP1NA,0.0

I saw the little squirt sliding down the slide in kindergarten. I saw him get his first A in the first grade on a big math test. I saw him get into a fight in second grade over a girl. In third grade, I saw him make a fun science experiment. It was a volcano. This was very impressive and I was proud. After the slideshow, there was a pizza party. Everybody was excited and I had a lot of slices. Everybody was full from the pizza. There was some soda and I drank some.

I also heard stories in person from friends about what they did over the weekend with other friends. Not once the entire holiday season was I invited to any of these events despite the fact that mutual friends were all included. I realize that I become quite a hermit during the winter months so I don't typically do much but it would be nice to at lease be given the option of going. December was relatively mild compared to previous years so I might have done more if I had been given the option. I'm sure that if my friends heard me talking this way, they would make excuses like ""we didn't want to just have you watch us skate"" or ""we know how cold you get outside"" or ""we know you need to be careful about germs."" The problem is, no one asked and gave me the choice to decide for myself. They made the decision for me that the event was something I wouldn't want to do. I often become a little down during the winter months and this is the exact reason why. I sit in my house for weeks at a time without any contact with people (besides my daughter and home care workers) other than Facebook. It makes me feel really frustrated and lonely. People often say ""well, you should plan something"" or ""invite people over."" I do those things but I don't feel like I should always have to initiate social events especially when there are events going on that are already planned. During the winter months, my days are nearly exactly the same each day. I get up, work, take care of my daughter, and go to bed. I really have very little to look forward to except spring. Yes, spring, that season that is still months away.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87J5WEMJ,,0.0

It was supposed to be a really good time, we arrived on a Thursday afternoon. The water was lush and the temperature was perfect. We all went to the beach the next Friday. It was a really good time, everyone was having a lot of fun. The next Saturday we woke up and went to brunch before hitting the beach again. Once again, it was a memorable time and we all had a lot of fun. We went body surfing in the water when all of a sudden we saw a shark fin. Another swimmer appeared to have gotten bit, this was completely crazy. I swam as fast as I could to help the other swimmer, and when I arrived he seemed ok. But he couldn’t swim, and so I helped him to get back to the shore. It was a struggle to help him. When I got back to the shore I looked around for the lifeguard but couldn’t find him. So I wrapped up the shark bite wounds with my towel and drove this guy to the hospital. The hospital said he would be ok and only needed some stitches. I waited for the guy to get the medical treatment that he needed. It didn’t take that long and he eventually got the treatment. Later that day he thanked me and invited me and my friends to a party. We all became good friends and to this very day, we all stay in touch. It was a radical moment in my life.",3QJOXOW4XKDBCCH60PL2KD87K9NMER,,0.0

When the results came back, she asked me to see her in her office. I went in on a Tuesday morning. The doctor sat down with me and explained that I was pre-diabetic and obese. She told me that I need to lose at least 90 pounds and keep it off to put myself back in a healthy weight range to possibly reverse the adverse health problems that had been caused by my overeating and inactive habits. Since then, I have switched to a low carbohydrate diet that has a focus of protein and vegetables. I also started going for 40 minute walks everyday.

I always advised my daughter that if she ever comes into a situation where she does not agree with something, that she needs to take a moment and collect herself. Take a few deep breaths, gather her thoughts. Be open to what the other person may be thinking. Try to understand the situation and then offer your two cents. You will not get anywhere when you act upon emotions in a very tense situation.

We started our trip with a 4 hour flight into JFK Airport. We experienced our first subway ride together (and didn't even get lost!) on the way to the airport. Over the next few days, we spent our time waking up late and staying out late, experiencing everything New York City has to offer. We went to the Statue of Liberty, the 9/11 Memorial, Top of the Rock, Chelsea Markets, China Town, Little Italy and so many more it's hard to list them all.  My son was amazed at all of it.  He told me that it was exactly like it is shown on television, from all the people and the buildings, to the steam coming from the sewer grates at night. We went on a top of the bus tour into Brooklyn, saw Tom Hiddelston on Broadway, and spent the day in Central Park. I think you could live in New York City for years and still not see all of it.

I went on a trip with my youngest son to NYC.  It was our first trip together, just the two of us. It was the first time either of us have ever been to NYC.  It was amazing.  The sights, the sounds, the energy of the city!  We visited the Statue of Liberty, the 911 Memorial, Central Park, and so many more places.  We stayed out late and slept in late. My son's favorite place was Times Square.  He loved the bright lights and the people.  I enjoyed seeing all the places.  I don't think I could pick a favorite.  I loved the history behind the Statue of Liberty.  The 911 Memorial was sobering and left us quiet and contemplative.  Central Park was a fantastic dose of nature in the middle of the large city.  China Town and Little Italy were so exciting and different for us.  The most memorable thing for me happened on the last day.  We were walking towards the subway to head back to the airport.  My son turned to me and said ""Mom this was an amazing trip.  I had so much fun with you.  Thanks.""",3QL2OFSM9742XWISGZU774X44NQCNU,,0.0

Experimenting with drugs was probably the first of it, and it never really stopped.  I wouldn't say I've ever had a ""problem,"" but it has made me view the world, and the people surrounding me differently, less judgmentally - maybe sometimes more judgmentally.  Recently, I was invited to a ""dance party under the stars,"" where I went to a swimming hole to camp in a town that no longer has a police force.  I did what I always do in these situations - I took psychedelic drugs and went on an adventure in my mind. But this time it was different - this time, no one else was doing the same.  For the first time, this ""hobby"" of mine I used to make friends and relate to people, made me an outcast.  I was alone, I was terrified - I was hiding in my car ripping my inner self to shreds and rebuilding who I was.  For eight hours, I hated who I was, what I was doing, and I just wanted to disappear, I wanted everyone to forget I existed - while simultaneously knowing how much it would hurt when I was forgotten.  I spent that night alone. While everyone else was dancing under the stars, drinking, and sharing love, I was hiding so no one would know what I had done.  In retrospect, I do not think I would have been as harshly judged as I felt like I was in that moment, but I do believe no one would have wanted to spend that evening with me anyways.  I missed out on a good time because I tried to make it better with substances. We are a sum of our experiences, we must take the good with the bad.  All my mistakes have made me who I am and I have grown from my experiences.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF03EOUI,0.0

We started the night by stopping by one of our favorite restaurants and got vegan buffalo wings (the best in town, in my opinion) and a gigantic soft pretzel with mustard and beer cheese sauce. It was right before he was about to leave for an internship for the entire summer, so spending the night together was really intimate and fun, albeit quite bittersweet because I knew he would be leaving within two days. After talking about how much we loved each other over an amazing dinner, we got on the train and actually went to the concert. I distinctly remember looking over at him and watching him glow with joy at the show; I studied his smile and his eyes and was reminded just how much I loved him. ELO is one of my favorite bands and they were one of the best live performances I've ever seen. I sang at the top of my lungs and danced to some of my favorite songs, and my boyfriend and I held hands and smiled at one another during the slow songs. The lights were flashing all around me and it felt like I had been pulled from reality and inserted into a new world that was only dictated by feelings of euphoria and bliss. I also have a funny memory of buying a shirt, spending 20 minutes deliberating whether or not I should get another size, then running back downstairs during a break to switch it out for a smaller one (while my boyfriend begrudgingly followed behind me, but we laugh about it). My favorite part was discovering new songs that have become some of my favorites today, like ""Xanadu."" I had no idea I would fall in love with so much more of their music! Listening to it live for the first time felt like magic was pulsing into my soul. I am often moved by music but this experience was truly something else. The entire night I felt nothing but happiness, like I was right where I was supposed to be - I wasn't worrying about being separated for the summer or starting summer classes. All I cared about was experiencing what it feels like to be in love in one of my favorite settings: an incredible concert. We waited a long time for the train to take us home afterwards, listening to our new favorite ELO songs on my phone while I sat in his lap. When we got back, we stayed up late to have snacks and spend some quality time together for the last time in a long while. It's one of the most memorable nights I've had with him and something I'll carry in my heart for a long time, especially because it also involves one of my favorite musical acts.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFCI8UOO,0.0

My husband talked about how much he was looking forward to the day. He had a difficult week but this was curing him. We walked to the main gazebo where we were going to have some berries. Along the way there we saw a few animals. The part was known to have a lot of various animas living there. The biggest animal we saw was a deer. It was with her little doe. The two were munching on some foliage in the distance. We then saw dragonflies near the gazebo. I remember catching them during the summer with my siblings when I was growing up.

It had been raining quite a bit recently, so the service berry bushes were full.  We enjoyed eating service berries as we walked.  All along the pathways, especially when there was tall grass on either side, were a large number of dragonflies flying around.  I knew that there is a spring of water in the area, but I hadn't seen so many flying around at one time before!  We noticed a female deer resting among tall grass, but once she saw that we were no threat, she remained where she was.  We also saw ravens in a tree playing with little sticks. The weather was very nice that evening; it was nice to be outside with my spouse enjoying the fresh air. There was an avenue of blooming trees that we walked along, so fragrant.  The trees were also apparently full of wasps and bees, because they were buzzing so loudly!  Apparently we weren't the only ones enjoying the fragrant trees.  One thing that happened during the walk was that a dragonfly landed on my spouse's shoulder, holding a wasp it had caught!  It was big (both insects), and I was surprised to find out that dragonflies ate wasps. The dragonfly landed only briefly, and then flew away.  It was a really wonderful, memorable walk.",3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJFT9EOUN,,0.0

This might not sound like a huge ordeal, but let me explain further.  My six year old son is medically complex and has a seizure disorder with a chromosomal abnormality.  I was using the restroom when suddenly, I heard a loud boom.  I ran out of the bathroom to see my little boy lying unconscious on the floor.  I assumed he hit his head.  I ran down the steps.  His eyes rolled back into his head and he began seizing.  I was in a state of panic.  I yelled for my husband to dial 911.  He remained unconscious for what felt like hours.  In reality, it was only about three minutes before paramedics arrived.  He was shaking in my arms, started to turn a pale shade of blue and was not alert at all.  I was crying and yelling his name, but in my mind, imagining that this was the day that I was going to lose my child.  EMS administered a medication rectally.  He started to cry inconsolably, and then said ""Mommy.""  I have never felt more joy in my heart to hear that little voice.  We were taken to the hospital and stayed for two days for further monitoring.  I could not stop kissing his little cheeks during those days, and felt so emotional knowing that things could have ended so differently.",,3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20J1VC90I,0.0

He was in the hospital due to problems with his legs and congestive heart failure.  He seemed to be doing better than he had been and he was sitting up when we came into the room. and watching a baseball game on TV.  His doctor had actually told him he'd be getting out the next day so he was in a good mood.  I took my 12-year old son with me and he wore a St. Patty's day blow-up hat that everybody was laughing at and my brother thought was funny.  My mother was there visiting also and she thought the hat was funny.  I also brought him a flower centerpiece for his room that was St. Patty's day related.  He wanted to talk to his wife who was in the Philippines and I tried to help him call her, but we were unable to get her on the phone.  He also wanted me to get him some sugar-free candy as I usually picked some up in the store in the lobby of the hospital when I visited, but it is a smaller hospital and the store was closed because it was Sunday.  So, I offered to go to Walmart nearby to get him some.  I left and came back with the candy and he was very happy that I did this.  One odd thing that happened is I saw a friend who I used to work with at Walmart which was surprising as this area was quite a distance from where I thought this friend lived.  But, my friend told me she had recently moved to that area.  I was unable to go back to visit him when he took a turn for the worse within the next week and was sent to ICU.  I came down with the flu and I did not want to spread my germs in the hospital and definitely not to my brother.  The last thing I remember is the tight hug we shared and us both saying we loved each other.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JHYX09G,,0.0

Some friends of mine from church stopped by to tell us it was on the way and we should make plans to evacuate. They prayed for us and left. Most of the people in town had evacuated or stayed in a shelter. Not my family and I though. We have been through multiple hurricanes before and none of them had caused significant enough damage to justify leaving the house this time. We unanimously agreed that we would stay in the house and brave this out. Sure enough this turned out to be a category 5. Several hours into the storm, the windows blew out. And with that came flooding indoors. I was starting to wish that I had left, so my family and I are grabbed our most important belongings and put them into a suitcase. The next step was to get up to the car. This was difficult because the driveway was almost completely flooded. Fortunately we made it. My wife steered the car and I was able to push it from the front into the road. When we got to the highway it was raining so hard and obscured my vision. As I was turning a car came out of nowhere and hit the car. The next thing you know I woke up in a hospital. It turned out that I had 2 broken legs but everyone else was OK. Then the nurse came in and told me I had a visitor. It turned out to be my friends from the church. Hey cracked a joke saying that I should have listened to them in the first place but were glad I was OK. They congratulated me on getting my family to safety at least. Next time I'm going to take such warnings seriously. I don't wanna ever experience something like that again.",,3QUO65DNQVAG1BZ435FKGZJF0TRUOH,0.0

This brought back a flood of memories of our younger days when he was growing up. Baseball was such an important part of all of our lives.  Seeing him standing at the plate ready to swing at a pitch erased so many years in-between.  My husband coached him when he was starting out and through his high school years which culminated in his winning a scholarship to play in college.  We traveled all over watching him pitch and so this day, watching him play again made me go back in time in my head because all the sights and sounds were the same.  He stood in the batter's box in the same exact way.  So many things have happened since that earlier time.  He played professionally for a time.  He's since married and had a child but while I was sitting and watching him it might just as well have been 25 years ago.  Time goes by so quickly that we're hardly aware of the changes that happen.  It made me very happy to be brought back to that simpler time that day. I hope that he continues to play in the spring.  He swore he'd never play as an adult but it obviously agreed with him. He needs to keep it up.",3QXNC7EIPJHXE2JI39IIU20JS0B099,,0.0

I suddenly received a call from my younger cousin that he got a job at Google. it was one of the happiest days of my life as I was really really excited for him. I was so happy and excited because I personally sponsored his academics. right from when he was little and therefore I'm like a father to him. We lost our parents when we were very little.

It has undeniably changed our lives. we now have to do things differently in the way that we choose to live. Being that my son has diabetes we don't really eat anymore how we used to eat. we eat a lot less foods with sugars in them processed or added sugars in lunches and dinners. Sometimes it can be hard because he still can't eat certain foods at all. It makes our food very limited in what we eat. we had a short hospital stay that taught me a lot more than just basic care of the child. with type 1 diabets it taught me how to have a different perspective on life in general.

The daughter had just moved to Atlanta from North Carolina to work for a university there. She was hesitant about leaving the university she had worked at for over 10 years in North Carolina. The elder and his wife received a phone call stating their daughter had passed away. She had just accepted this new job in April of this year. It was hard for everyone to believe that less than six months later this young lady would be taken away. The university in North Carolina where she worked honored her life on their campus. The young lady was responsible for securing grants for students and underprivileged individuals to attend the university, who without her efforts would never have been able to do so. She worked in the same capacity at the new university in Atlanta. The boss the young lady worked for recounted her last day here on earth, as she was the last person to be with her. Though it was a painful recollection, it also painted a picture of the daughter's last hours on earth. The boss said they enjoyed a beautiful sunny day and that the daughter had been happy and was doing what she did best; helping others. There wasn't a dry eye in the place after her very vivid and poignant memory of their last encounter. She even spoke of a selfie that was taken of the two of them that was the last picture the young lady took before passing on. If you didn't know this young lady personally, after the tributes given at her celebration of life service, you were made to feel as if you'd known her your entire life.",3QY7M81QH88VD92TS5UGZQOMB6S7K5,,0.0

Fast forward to four years in college, it was her graduation party. I attended the party with one of our other friends as she was someone we loved so much and very proud of. Her relatives from Germany were also in attendance. I knew it was set to be a glamorous graduation party. I thought she was just going to give a vote of thanks when she picked up the mic. It was more than what I thought as she started talking about her ordeal in college and how she scaled through. She started by thanking God and her parents, the school, faculty and friends. As she mentioned friends, I was happy she has finally recognized us as part of his college journey. I didn't expect it when she mentioned how I have been a source of inspiration to her and about how I have been hardwired with the will to go on. I was moved to tears while she talked about me.

There were endless nights full of hope for her recovery. At night before I would doze off to sleep I would look at her closely. She still had that same pretty face, beautiful eyes, lovely shaped lips and brilliant mind. But deep inside, it was too painful to see my ever energetic mother lying in bed with all the tubes in her body. Too hurtful to think that all we had shared, our plans might come to an endâ€¦This is an adolescent daughter’s account of her journey with having a mother diagnosed with cancer. Dealing with maternal cancer can cause distress and anxiety because this illness is usually associated with poor prognosis, agonizing pain, negative effects of the treatment, and low survival rates. Cancer is considered by many as a “silent killer,” which unsuspectingly ravages the body from within. It can be a stressful experience, not only for the patients themselves, but also for the entire family. Every member of the family, especially the children, has to adjust to the emotional burden, physical demands, and lifestyle changes which cancer brings about. The occurrence of cancer has alarmingly increased throughout the years, affecting and claiming many lives around the world. It has been estimated that around 12. 2 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide (American Cancer Society, 2007). It is also projected that the number of cancer cases and deaths will continue to escalate in the future. New cancer cases are estimated to increase from 11. 3 million in 2007 to 15. 5 million in 2030 (WHO, 2008). Based on the worldwide proliferation of cancer cases, this disease is now considered to be a major health problem.",,3R08VXYT7DHM89WAHJDJN1IHOHNW7A,0.0

It was the first time that happened in a while. It's funny because we can go months without a single fight, but as soon as one happens it hurts just like it used to when we fought daily. We had both had some drinks, like usual. We drank probably about 12 beers between the 2 of us and it was a Friday night, so Tommy decided to buy Fireball as well. He had been in a shitty stressed out mood and had worked a lot of hours, but the night started out okay. We listened to music and then were invited to a bonfire down the road at one of our neighbors. We have a toddler, but the night was warm and we were just gonna stop by for a minute. We got her bundled up, and she enjoyed walking in her stroller. At that time eveyrthing was fine. What started the fight was when Tommy finally came home. Tommy had a few more shots of his Fireball while we were at the neighbors, and I grew  tired of having to chase around my toddler. After all, it was getting late. So I went home with the baby...Tommy was supposed to be following me, but didn't get home for another 30 minutes. I was irritated and kinda bitchy, because he always does this crap to me. He works so hard and for so many hours, and then wants to spend time with everyone else when he is home. So I WAS being a bitch, and I was tired...and of course he completely goes off and gets defensive. He never sees my side of the story, and I never get to have any sort of negative feelings ...but whatever. I'm used to keeping my mouth shut. It wasn't until after the baby went to bed when we started pushing each other around a little bit. Our physical fights are few and far between and they're not as bad as they once were...but still everyone is bullcrap. It's pathetic I gotta keep my emotions in....and I'm getting so sick of it! I will not live like this for another 12 years!!",3R2PKQ87NXUNSHJSW8BT5S6ZDPDMIU,,0.0

It was a relatively solemn occasion. What surprised me most happened when I saw my girlfriend's dad cry for the first time. He wasn't all that close with his father. The tears certainly surprised me. It was a jarring image to see. Afterwards, we all went out to eat. We had a buffet style dinner at a Polish restaurant. We talked about memories we had of him. I wasn't overly fond of him, so most of my stories I would have shared wouldn't have been positive, but alas. His wife made sure to talk to several people and offered leftovers to everyone. It seems to be a slightly impersonal ending to the day, as it seemed way too normal to me for some reason. I drove home with my girlfriend and recounted the day. She said she, too, found it strange.

This house is far more than a place to live. It has always been my safe space. She raised me from the time I was 3. She has always been my person. The one person who I could call when everything is going wrong and she would say ""come on over!"" Now that she is moving I feel like that is all changing. Heaven forbid I need a place to go her house won't be an option. I have been helping her to clean it out and go through things. I am strong for her but I really could just sit down and cry.    When you are a child you don't ever think that your childhood home will one day be gone. But that is how I feel. My safe space will belong to someone else and never again will I pull into that driveway and walk up to the door. I think that is the hardest part. I wonder how many times I will forget and pull in without even thinking about it.    As I was helping her go through photographs and papers I found so many of my photos that I didn't even realize existed. She has every dance photo I ever took. She has all of my costumes too! I am 33 years old and my grandmother has kept every childhood memory she could of me. It is nice to know that those memories mean just as much to her as they do to me. When it is gone for good I will still have all of those memories. And I can still go visit my grandmother and talk with her. For that I am so thankful. She is my safe space. Not the house.

It was not a planned retirement. The management harasses employees on a daily basis and makes the job a miserable place to be. After months of going to counseling and being medicated by a psychiatrist, my husband decided he had to leave. Several other older employees left the job as well due to the constant stress was making them ill.  So now he and I are both at home, at least for now. His pension money is coming in monthly so we're able to pay our mortgage and car payment. We've seen a financial counselor which has helped a lot. Our 401K money has been mostly invested in a variety of stocks except for a small amount that we kept out for living expenses. Since we've received some money, we have more time to decide what to do. I'll probably will take a part time job somewhere but I'm less stressed than before and I don't feel rushed. My Turk earnings help me make extra payments on my credit cards and I'm making progress in paying them down. We often see the mail trucks in our neighborhoods speeding down the streets. They are driving unsafely but they are afraid of being written up by their bosses. The job wasn't always like it is now. The Postal Service has GPS now so they can track each employee all day. The postal worker is given a few minutes only to deliver a package and the majority of their workload consists of packages, not letters. Employees used to be able to stop and talk to their customers and they usually knew if anything was wrong. My husband even saved a customer's life once because she had cut herself so he wrapped her arm up while they waited for the ambulance. Now they aren't allowed to stop except to drop the mail quickly and get going again. More employees are falling, getting bit by dogs and having accidents because they are rushed.",3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGD4VFZC,,0.0

We partied like rockstars. Seeing the falls was so awe inspiring too. It really helped sober us up. Just enough to go back to the bar that afternoon and get drunk again.

It has been incredibly difficult to deal with. I was staying with her, taking care of her, and doing her laundry, cooking, picking up her medications, etc. For years, she was in and out of the hospital, but she always came back home within a month. They would have to regulate her medications, and she was fine. This time was different. She had to have open heart surgery. My family and I went through a lot of ups and downs. One day they would tell us that she's making great progress on her recovery, the next, they'd say she's regressing. This went on for a month, before they finally told us there was nothing they could do for her. She and I had our fair share of issues, but we both loved each other very much. She was the only person I could say who truly loved me. Now she's gone, and I've been staying at a friend's house, trying to decide what to do next. I've suffered with depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidal thoughts for decades. I honestly don't know if I want to continue. My mom was the only reason I kept going. I knew that if I committed suicide while she was alive, that it would kill her. Now she's gone, and I have no reason to live.",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGMYSZFQ,0.0

My step father, a very healthy man most of his life, was suddenly struck ill with a possible stroke. As a family, we've always been close. We generally know when one or another is sick or feeling bad. He had exhibited signs and symptoms, but we could not get him to respond or go to the Doctor. It really upset us that we could not get him to go. His stubbornness initially made us mad, but we got past that. He was just too ill to feel mad at during this dire situation. Upon visiting the doctor at the ER, he was diagnosed with a Subdural Hematoma. A Subdural Hematoma is what doctors refer to as a traumatic brain injury - which is in effect a collection of blood between the covering of the brain. It is very serious and can lead to death or disabilities if left untreated.  The Doctor will usually put you on a blood thinning medication such as Warfarin if your body is able to respond. Fortunately for our family, he got there in the nick of time. He is resting, recuperating, and responding to treatment and prognosis is looking great for a full recovery. We now wonder if his initial stubbornness was the result of the stroke - that is, the symptoms of not fully understanding the seriousness of the matter and deciding against going to the hospital.",,3RGU30DZTBUJNS3YEQWTHTLZPM2JM2,0.0

It was tough. The words just felt unnatural (at least in my head). I don't know if I said it to avoid the awkward silence or if I meant it. I really have only a few firsthand memories of my father growing up, all of which were positive. My mom always spoke poorly of him. I think I just believed he was this druggie/alcoholic loser that she made him out to be although I never saw him drunk or stoned that I was aware of. He lived out of state most of my life. From what I've been told, my parents eloped in Vegas after I was conceived and divorced before I was a year old. My mom never remarried or really even dated. But now that I'm getting to know him more, I'm learning there's a lot more than the labels my mom put on him and ingrained into my head. I'm kind of angry I never got the opportunity to learn this sooner. I remember always being afraid to ask for things without fearing some form of guilt relating to my father. When I was in middle school, I really wanted to play the saxophone. I worked up the courage to ask my mom. Per usual, she would tell me it was too expensive and to ""ask your father"". I was mentally punished for who my father was my entire life but I didn't even know him. Now that I'm getting to know him more as an adult, I wholeheartedly agree that I am a lot like him (looks, personality, etc.). I was always the black sheep of the family, so it's legit mind boggling to me to have so much in common with a relative for like the first time ever. I call him by his first name. I don't know if I'll ever adjust to calling him ""dad"" but I do remember I would dream of having a dad in my life as a kid. I think I am finally learning to understand myself, accept myself, and be myself.",3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGT4VUBK,3RANCT1ZVG3WIHAVZ0AYAFJGT4VUBK,0.0

We had talked about getting married, and we had gone to pick out my engagement ring together, but I didn't know when the actual proposal was going to happen. So I was kind of existing in limbo, just waiting for something to happen! We were on vacation in Florida and had gone out for a really nice dinner together, to an Italian restaurant. I remember having gnocchi but I'm not sure what Justin got. I was wearing my favorite black dress and the weather was beautiful. We split a serving of tiramisu for dessert. When we got back to our hotel, Justin suggested we take a nighttime walk on the beach -- it was really beautiful on the water, there was a breeze blowing over the waves, and all the stars were out. There were, by coincidence, fireworks going on across the water. I remember having my head on Justin's shoulder and his arm around my waist as we watched the fireworks. We were being quiet and then he said something like, ""We have a pretty good thing going, don't we?"" I said yes and was feeling very content and happy. Honestly I wasn't expecting the proposal to come right then, but he got down on one knee and asked me to marry him. I was grinning like a fool and my heart was going like gangbusters. He took the ring box out of his pocket and opened it to show me, then took the ring out of the box and put it on my finger. Of course I said yes, and then he asked if he could get up because there were rocks on the beach and he was hurting his knees! He got up, hugged me, and picked me up and twirled me around. We shared a kiss and then walked back inside because it was getting cooler. We decided not to tell anyone else until the morning so it could be our secret just for the night. When we told our parents and families, everyone was so happy -- they could see how suited we were for each other. We had also each been engaged (but not married) once before so everyone was glad that we had gotten it right this time around. Now we are planning the wedding and adjusting to our lives as an engaged couple!",,3R9WASFE2023HXGLAPV2AXPGMZPFZ5,0.0

Usually for me that means I had some amazing food at some super trendy brunch place with artisanal waffles or something, but I honestly can't remember the food this time. I remember getting up early that day and starting to pour some cereal, and my wife stopped me and said we should go out instead. I thought that was odd since it was so last minute, and we got dressed really quick to head out the door to the corner diner. Before I could get through placing my order, my wife just blurted out ""I'm pregnant"" with this huge smile on her face. She couldn't contain herself or even wait for us to get to the meal. The waitress, Rita, squealed with delight, and I jumped up and we all three embraced. We've been trying for quite some time, and this was such great news. We spent the whole breakfast planning out our future and talking about how this would change everything for the better. Our waitress gave us some tips on parenting as she has children of her own. My wife got a little sad at the end because she had imagined this big fancy way of telling me and this was so rushed and last minute instead. I told her it was perfect, because it was perfect. This was such a surprise as we'd both almost given up hope, and the way she told me was just so filled with joy and surprise that it fit so well with the surprise we'll be expecting soon. I want to tell more people than just our new waitress friend Rita, but it's too early for that. We've started talking about baby names, but if it's a girl, I'm pulling for Rita.",,3RKNTXVS3NKSI9BOEGJK201GFSZ4AU,0.0

I got a call from another friend with whom I hadn't spoken in a while. Even then I knew it wasn't gonna be good news. We had all shared a lot of memories over the years. Despite the somber setting we had a good time reliving some things from our past. The deceased's best friend had never lost a peer before so my heart went out to her especially. I remember feeling kind of hopeful once it was all over. Like life would carry on for me. I guess it seemed more like a celebration than other funerals had ever been. For the first little bit I was still ashamed to laugh at funny stories we were remembering or to raise my voice to add to the stories being told. But it felt more and more natural to talk about her with some enthusiasm. By the time it was over, there was definitely a feeling of healing. Not completely, though. It was still very raw for some.

Quite possible she may have had a cold or maybe she was struggling with allergies. It turned out that it was much more. Lilly suffered from a tumor on her heart and mucous that surrounded her lungs. We knew the results were unfavorable, but we didn't quite understand the severity. It was almost impossible to wrap our heads around. This seemingly healthy, happy, and beautiful dog was ill and right before our eyes we couldn't even grasp it. Within a week it was determined that to allow her the tiniest amount of suffering possible we would have to put her to sleep. It crushed us. It crushed me. I had never dealt with loss so abruptly and with something I cared so much about. I think about her every day and I know that her spirit still lives on.",,3RJSC4XJ11GEDFH60J51IMVHFW305M,0.0

It was few months back she went to the hospital to get a check up and had tests run.  The results came back and she learned that it was inoperable and she had short time to live. In the short time she had left. She decided to make a charity for the children of the neighborhood.

We were having a family get together for my sisters birthday and most of the family was there. Aunt comes in late, as usual, with her bratty daughter (15) in tow. Aunt places her purse by the front door. It's a huge monstrosity of a bag that is open at the top. This will be important later. They complain about the food all through lunch. We just ignore this and continue with fun of the day. After lunch, the parents are all drinking coffee in the dining room while the younger kids play and watch movies in the salon by the front door. Entitled cousin does not want to watch the movie that is on, I think it was Frozen, saying it is lame and is a kids movie.  She takes the remote and changes it to Game of Thrones. All the other kids are mad and complain that the show is too scary.  A tussle ensues for the remote and in the course of the wrestling, Aunts bag is knocked over and items scatter onto the floor.  My Sister comes in and tells everyone to quiet down, changes the show back to Frozen and takes the remote which makes Entitled cousin cry and scream that Nephew hit her and wants him punished. Aunt comes in and yells at Nephew that Cousin should have what she wants and for Nephew to stop being a brat. Then Aunt sees her bag knocked over and starts screaming at Nephew that he is stealing from her. She picks up her bag and says her FitBit is missing. I roll my eyes because of all the crap in that bag, how would she know immediately that her FitBit is missing. Aunt demands Nephew turns his pockets out. Nephew says he does not have her FitBit and to leave him alone. Sister tells Aunt that her Nephew does not have her FitBit and maybe she should look under the couch where her bag fell over. One of the other kids does just this and does find her FitBit. Aunt yells at Nephew saying he stowed it there for later so Sister tells Aunt that this is rediculous and it is time for them to leave.",,3RU7GD8VPPFI7YJ1T0XZQY6H1OMSPM,0.0

I flew into MSP early on a Sunday morning via a red-eye flight.  It was nice not to deal with so many people and I was able to sleep through part of it, so the day wasn't ruined.  My friend Mike from college picked me up and we went downtown for breakfast.  He and I chilled at his apartment and caught up for a few hours until the afternoon.  We met up with some of his friends in the city and saw a UFC headline match.  I decided to put money on some of the fights and got lucky.  It was foolish but hey, I was there to have fun and it wouldn't have cost much more to lose anyway.  I ended up winning about $50.  We hit up a couple bars afterward and had a nice time.  I wandered around a bit over the next couple days.  I didn't have much of an itinerary and it was nice not to have anything in particular to do until the weekend.  I spent almost a whole day at The Mall of America - it was huge, even larger than I was expecting it to be.  I went to see The Specials on Thursday as part of their 40th anniversary tour.  I like ska, and I don't listen to it much at home, but the show was fun and the music sounded pretty good in person, so I enjoyed myself.  On Friday and again on Saturday I met up with family outside the city.  It was a reunion party and we were able to spend it outside in the sun both days.  I played a lot of horseshoes and frisbee.  I flew back home Sunday morning.",,3RUIQRXJBCA5C09DHZ7RXVJ2T1YLLB,0.0

I worked really hard for a couple weeks to save up for her school clothes and new shoes, we got her a haircut and did everything she wanted. She got a new backpack and all of her school supplies. Two weeks ago they had a function at school to meet the teacher so we went and we got to play for a little bit. The kids in her class are just so adorable. She has a friend  and when we met him for the first time he was just so respectful and so silly. Just a typical four year old child. i remember going up to him and playing with him. He was playing in the play kitchen area with a couple other students and I walked up to him and asked what he was making. He was no nice, he made me a 'pizza'. It was fake of course. I spoke to the teacher is very nice also. I think Savannah will do very well. Yesterday she got a sad face because she didnt want to stand up for her morning meeting so I talked to her about it and hopefully she will make better and smarter choices next time she is in class.",,3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3UUIN0S,0.0

Today was the day, after all our training, today was finally the day. I jumped into the shower and quickly got myself dressed and ready to go. I got in my car and drove off to the track, my parents promising they'd be in tow to watch me racing. The hum of excitement at the race track was palpable, and I could barely contain myself as I got into my vehicle and the announcer counted down for the race. I slammed down on the accelerator and began to soar forward, the other racers becoming blurs around me as speed became the only thing on our minds. Everyone knew the stakes, this was a national race, any victory here would result in fame or fortune for the driver, and opening the door to something lifechanging. Distance wise, these races aren't very long, neither are they time-wise, really. But after spending so much time practicing, so much time racing, I've learned that no matter how long the race actually is, it always takes so much time to really get through it. Seconds pass like hours as I realize that I don't think that I'm passing anyone. The other racers edge forward ahead of me, and I keep slipping further and further back, my future slipping away slowly. As the race came to an end, and it was locked in that I lost the race so early on, I was a bit disappointed. But at the same time, I was proud. I followed my dream, I chased my goal, and I gave it my all. This experience will stay with me for the rest of my life, and I'm glad that I had it, win or lose.",,3RWE2M8QWIWI34NC4J1NC3V3U5J0NS,0.0

He always helped make facing life a little easier. No matter what I said or did all he showed was love. During the rougher times in life he was always by my side and helped me stay calm and think clearer. Those memories are what have fueled my decision. I greatly miss having a canine companion and after much research I have decided that a lab would be the best kind of dog to suit my lifestyle now. I particularly love the coloring on the chocolate labs and with a little luck I found my new doggy soul mate. I went to 3 different shelters and visited with many different dogs. While they are all adorable and I somewhat wish I could take them all home. There was something special about ""Sugar Bear"", even his name seems to fit perfectly. Once we met, it was literally love at first site. He is amazing and I feel so much happier having him in my life. Hands down the best decision I've ever made so far! I don't feel as depressed anymore now that I have a furry friend by my side. He makes my evening walks so much nicer and helps me feel safe. I love getting to cuddle with him at night after a long day. I can't believe I waited this long to adopt another dog honestly, but I am so happy that I finally did.

My husband and I aren’t rich, and we didn’t have the money to go out the next day to buy a new one at $1000.  We had to wait about a week to get the refrigerator.  In between that time, we had no means of keeping things cool or frozen.  I had to go to the store every day to buy a few bags of ice just to keep what we were having for dinner that night cold.   I am very careful as not to waste a thing in the kitchen.  If I make a whole roasted chicken, I use all the meat in a few different meals, then I take the carcus and boil it down for broth, and keep the broth in the freezer to make soups or whatever.  While the refrigerator was broken, there was no way to do that.  I was using the last bits of meat for a sandwich, and throwing the bones in the trash.  My husband got mad that I was wasting the bones...took the bones out of the trash and started to eat the TINY bits of meat off of each bone that had been thrown away.  I stood there in total disbelief at him eating something I threw away.  I was grossed out and disgusted.  I got angry and stormed outside for a bike ride around the neighborhood.  Not paying attention to where I was riding, my bike tires went off of the curb and I flipped my bike and went flying into the gravel.  I walked home bloodied and in pain.

I was used to working part-time jobs, and was not making that much. At the time, I was very depressed and stressed about my financial situation because I was in debt, broke, and had over $200,000 worth of student loans. I was at the end of my road because I was waking up extremely sad every day and I felt like I had nothing to live for. I was discouraged because I had been applying for jobs for months prior to graduating but everyone said i was applying too early and that I needed more experience. The longer I was unemployed the more depressed I had gotten. At this point, I was losing so much weight I was down to about 90 pounds and my appetite was pretty much non-existent. I decided that I needed to do something because I felt myself going to a very dark place that was scary to think about and I felt like I was going to end up doing something irrational that I would regret. I needed help but didn't want to ask anyone for help. I decided that I needed to get up and get my life together. One particular morning I woke up and applied to at least 30 jobs in one day. I was determined to find a job because I knew that would solve at least some of my problems. It would provide me with a stable full-time salary so I would be able to take care of some of my debt and other financial obligations. The next day, I decided that I needed to talk to someone, so I called a help hotline. I was on the phone with a specialist for about an hour and a half and she was able to help me feel better. The specialist boosted my confidence and gave me some tools that I could use next time I was feeling depressed or stressed. About a week later, I got called for an interview that I was really interested in. I ended up getting hired the same day, right after my interview which was really exciting and motivated me to do better.",3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FMD81,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPR1FMD81,0.0

I have a son who just turned 12, and since I'm in my 30's I figured I was done. I am also a very independent woman, with a good career and almost done with my MBA. So the timing is a little hectic. I always had planned on having another after my son, but when it didn't happen in a few years I started to make other plans. I have been a single mother for years and felt no need to settle, so I was planning on adopting in the next few years. I've also worked very hard on my fitness the past 2 years, and this plan felt perfect so I wouldn't have to give up the progress on my body. About 6 months ago I started dating a coworker, who is a great man. I'd even told him not to expect me to have kids if he wanted to be with me. Then after just 2 months I found out I was pregnant. At first it was a huge shock, and honestly I wasn't very happy. After some months to get used to it, I can honestly say I'm very excited now though. It's been a huge adjustment, however. I went from living alone to having my boyfriend move in to help with my bills. Being an only child, my personal space is very important to me. I understand some sacrifices are necessary though, and in the end it will definitely be worth it.",3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,3S06PH7KSSQ9OHHHB8RKU32JOBW1DQ,0.0

Maybe I'm ready for my life to mean something more than...to be about something more than just me, just getting through, just going from one moment to the next. I keep thinking about the future. What it looks like, what's going to happen after I'm gone. I never really thought much about it before, never really thought about the past either for that matter. And now, all of a sudden, it's like time has just opened up before me. I think about the baby inside me. Who are they going to be? Where are they going to end up? How will they change the world. I keep think too about the past, all the people before me who were once children, were once babies growing inside someone's stomach. It makes me dizzy, like looking up at the stars from the top of the mountain--how they just keep going and going.

She was determined to start her own lipgloss line. At first, I was a bit skeptical, since she had been prone to picking up hobbies and tossing them aside quite often throughout her youth. However, I quickly realized that she had put a considerable amount of thought into this and was surprisingly passionate about it. I was quite happy for her to say the least and was myself determined to help her in any way that I could. The primary aspects she wanted help with were the packaging and the pricing for her products. I was pleased to find that she was so deep into the process of creating this lipgloss line. Of course, I thought these were great ideas to start with. To start, we went to a nearby crafts and art supplies store and decided to spend much of the day browsing the extensive collection for what would work best. She already had her mind set on packaging that was bold and memorable. We looked first at the most striking colors and materials we could find. To my surprise, she was immediately taken by a combination of colors and materials, as though she had fully established in her mind the design she'd be going for. We selected our packaging supplies and were thrilled we had made it so far so efficiently. We then thought extensively about pricing. She had several ideas and was confident that they would work. I searched online for similar pricing models for makeup and lipgloss lines and quickly found that my daughter's ideas were in line with the common pricing trends. The whole day proved to be a success and I love that my daughter has finally found an aspect of her life she can be fully involved in and passionate about.

Your body is usually trying to tell you something when things aren't working right or when the body is being attacked. I finally felt like it was time to go see a doctor because this wasn't normal for my body to be feeling like this. I went into the doctors office and sat down; I was very nervous about this day. The waiting room was filled with other sick people. However I did not look sick as the other patients, but I felt very exhausted. I finally went back to speak with the doctor and told him all of my symptoms, as I was telling him I felt like a weight was lifted off of my shoulders only to be exchanged for this other burden to be placed upon them. I took some labs and a few blood test and waited in the room as the test were examined. The doctor came back and said ""You have a rare disease"", I was floored. Everything seemed to be going in slow motion as the doctor was talking about what the disease was, I did not even hear him tell me what it was. I was thinking if it was a fatal disease, or if it would change my quality of life. I just shook my head and the doctor tried to calm me by saying ""don,t worry we will do our best to help!"" I left and went and picked up my prescriptions. I sat at home by myself staring into the nothingness of my emotions thinking about what will become of me and my newly discovered disease. I turned on a gospel sermon to listen to and coincidentally it the sermon had to do with unforeseen circumstance and how to deal with them. The pastor said that ""these circumstances aren't here to hold you back; but here to propel you forward to your purpose."" I felt a lot better and started thinking of my new purpose and why I was chosen to have this rare disease. I knew that I would have to change a lot of my habits and make better decisions for my health. I sat down and made a list of things I would need to change and a list of things I have always wanted to achieve.

The death of my father, however, was something I don't think I'll ever be able to fully get over. I love my father so much. He was always there for me, always by my side. He gave me the best advice anyone could ever give. He was there through my first break up, there for my graduation, even there for me when I was going through a rebellious phase in my 20s. Most people rebel in high school, but I was a really good kid. I guess in my early 20s I was tired of being so good, though. I just know that he would always love me. I knew that he would always be there no matter what. To this day, I still feel upset over his death, and the way he died. I will never be able to live the same again. I try not to get so sad, because I know he wouldn't want that for me. But it's so extremely hard not to miss him. I honor him every year on his birthday.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRZYE8DO,0.0

The rain started out as a drizzle at first but eventually turned into a raging downpour. I remembered the weather said it would be storming today but I didn't realize how bad it was going to get. I turned on the radio and set the channel to the local news station hoping to get some info about the forecast. As much as I was focused on keeping my car on the road during this monsoon, I still had an appointment to get to and at this time I was starting to run late. I got onto 95 North and started picking up speed. The rain was seriously coming down now and I could barely see out of the windshield. Up ahead there were a few cars travelling about the same speed as me on this four lane stretch of the highway. My windshield wipers were trashing from side to side violently as I did my best to stay in lane. Out of nowhere I saw a white sedan that had been cruising in the slow lane start to drift over across the lane next to it. It turned sideways and shot across the highway, slamming directly into the black SUV that was about fifty feet or so in front of me. I slammed the breaks and felt the ABS kick in but it didn't do much to stop me. Both of the cars came together with a loud bang and collided with the jersey wall on the left side of the road. I must have come within about 10 feet of hitting these two cars as they were drifting across the highway. I passed the wreckage and looked in the rear view mirror as the cars came to a rest blocking three of the four lanes. I didn't stop and just kept on driving. I was so shook up that I just felt numb and scared. I thought about that event for a long to afterwards and easy it would have been for that to me in the accident.",,3S0TNUHWKU4RZH12AT0Z9DPRSMLD85,0.0

There was a huge rain storm and my house flooded. This sucks because the insurance is not going to cover it. At least I started my new job for more income and better benefits. That is the one good thing going for me. I am glad that everyone was ok but the money needed will take years to make up. The worst part was it was my birthday when this happened. We had just got done singing happy birthday when the sirens went off. I got the alert on the phone and shrugged it off not thinking about it. I got done opening the last present when the water started rising in the basement. I put some towels down and went to bed thinking it will stop. I wish this is where it ended. I woke up a few hours later to the dog barking.  That is when the trouble happened. There was about 2 feet of water in the basement and continued to rise. A few hours later it was up to the stairs and I had to get everyone else out. Luckily we ran uphill to the neighbors and they were safe. Unforunately I went back and everything was almost underwater. Once again, I am happy we all left, but not the best birthday ever.",,3S3AMIZX3VRTBKRFR5G4BZLARA8CDF,0.0

I had no idea that I was going to be thrown this party and I had no idea who was going to be there. The party was thrown by my Aunt with the help of two of my close friends. I usually don't like surprises and this is well known among my friends and family. Despite not liking surprises the perfect planning and inclusion of the correct people made the night a real success. I was really touched by the fact that people were willing to do so much for me. I didn't realize how special of a gesture it was to plan a party for someone without their input. The most memorable part of the evening was when I came up to the balcony and saw all of my friends. I knew they were going to be afraid of my reaction, but I think I was able to act happy enough to convince them I wanted the party. This was also very significant to me because it was a birthday that I was planning on doing nothing for. If my friends asked me to have a party before this event I would definitely have turned down the idea. Another thing that made the even very special were the choices of food and drinks. My friends chose to have Mexican food, and also chose to drink tequila. Mexican food is my favorite type of food and I love when it is paired with Tequila.

I was amazed at what the classes and the environment had done for him. His body transformed from that of a soft, pudgy video game fanatic into the lean body of a junior Tarzan. He also came out of his shell. He is a shy, socially awkward boy and the extremely positive and supportive atmosphere helped him to be more confident in himself and more comfortable with other people. It really made me feel like I wanted to be a part of this big ""family"", so I signed up. I was still very worried that my age and the extra pounds I was carrying would be embarrassing at least and insurmountable at worst. In my very first class I met a student who was older than my mother and another who weighed over 300 pounds. They both assured me that it was fun and very doable for people of all ages and sizes. I also was treated in a very supportive and encouraging manner by everyone, regardless of their age or level of ability. I think the most surprising thing was that I apparently move really well for a 50 year old. I was really proud of myself when I realized that I could keep up with the youngsters. I'm not as fast and flexible as they are, of course, but I can make up for it with my strength and my focus on proper technique.

On this trip my wife, two daughters, sister, brother, niece and nephew accompanied me. We went out to a Mexican dinner the first night. We went to laguna beach the next day and went to a restaurant on the ocean for lunch. My 2 year old daughter went to the beach for the first time on this trip. She was scared at first but then really liked the ocean. We also went to the Huntington Library. On the last night we gave my dad gifts and went to the Panda Inn for dinner. It was an enjoyable trip filled with lots of memories. This may or may not be the last time I visit my dad in California, so I am glad it was a good trip. I am also happy I got to do this trip with my family. The weather was pretty good on the trip. It did rain on one day. The beach day was very sunny. We got to see where they live for the first time since they had moved. The food was very good on the trip. I ate a hamburger at the Burbank airport on the way home.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE554AXC,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE554AXC,0.0

We walked down a dirt road in my neighborhood where I knew we would see many interesting things including an old cemetery at the end of the road. This cemetery was what I would call a ""farmer's cemetery"" as most of the people listed on the tombstones were related and multi-generational and it was built on some old farmland. My grandson and I read some of the tombstones and discussed some of the ages when people died and were buried there. We came across a tombstone of a boy who died at age 5, the same age as my grandson. My grandson had a difficult time understanding how someone his age could have died. He said he thought only old people, like me!, died. I explained there were lots of reasons why a young person could die, such as an accident, disease, illness, etc.  He seemed to be surprised but also enlightened to his mortality. I was surprised that he believed only old people could die. The only people he knows who have died were all elderly, so it makes sense. It was also surprising that he considers me old. That never came up before. I don't like to think of myself as old, but to a five year old, I guess I am. It made me think about my mortality too.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE7LUAX0,0.0

The only place to take a walk that was safe was on the country road across from my house where there was a little cemetery.  It was a beautiful sunny day and there was a warm breeze blowing the smell of the newly blossomed lilacs in the air.  I couldn't see any lilac trees or bushes but figured there must be one behind the little storage building in the cemetery and the scent was blowing towards us.  I decided to push the stroller with my little grandson on the sidewalks within the cemetery.  Within minutes, my little grandson asked, ""Grandma, what's that smell?""  I sometimes answer his questions with a question to see what he is thinking.  So I asked him, what do you think it is?  To which he replied, I didn't know dead people smelled so good.  I will never forget that day and sure enough after we walked behind the storage shed, there stood a beautiful lilac bush.  I didn't want my little grandson thinking dead people smelled good, so I showed him where the smell was coming from.  We just never know what the little ones will say.  There are truly innocent and filled with wonder.  My walk through the cemetery was fun and educational.  One of the joys of being a grandmother!  I will treasure these times and moments for as long as I can remember.",3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE7LUAX0,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYE7LUAX0,0.0

I had no plans and wasn't really expecting to do anything for my birthday other than what I normally do on an average day. To my surprise, on the day of my birthday, I woke up to a birthday card from my parents that included two tickets of a flight to the Bahamas that was departing in six hours and a note that we have reservations at a hotel for the week. I immediately went to thank my parents and then called my girlfriend to tell her the news. I wanted her to come with me, she was extremely surprised and excited too. We only had about five hours to get ready, pack, and make it to the airport. We were going to the Bahamas for a week! About two hours until the flight departures, there is a knock at our door. We answer it and it's a limo driver! My parents even surprised us with a limo that would take us to the airport. We couldn't believe it! We go to the airport in the limo and get on the flight. We arrive in the Bahamas and we were brought to our hotel. The hotel room was a suite and it was just absolutely gorgeous, it had an ocean and pool view too. The pool area even had some big slides that made it like a water park. We didn't get to do much the first day because we were traveling but we did go out for a very nice dinner at a restaurant that was on the beach and I think I had the best seafood I've ever had there. We also sat on the beach and listened to the waves afterwards and went in the hot tub for a little bit before we went to sleep. This was definitely the most shocking and exciting day of my life and I'll always remember it.",,3SB4CE2TJWHJGBZYYRLPZBYEXX4XAB,0.0

I first met GW when I went to work for my uncle at his business after I graduated from college. GW was my uncle's neighbor and he worked part time there. GW didn't talk a lot but he had a wicked sense of humor. He and his wife, AW, raised 4 kids together in the same house for 50 years. I didn't get to see GW often after I got a new job and moved but I heard for AW that GW wasn't feeling so well since last year. He was in and out of hospital a lot of the time. Then in March I got a call from AW that GW was in the hospital again and would like to see me and my uncle. I got the feeling that this might be the last time we will speak to each other again. This might be the goodbye the we all dreaded. On a beautiful Saturday I drove my uncle and my aunt to visit GW at the hospital. On the way there we bought him some flowers for the room. When we got there I could hardly recognize GW. He looked so thin and frail and his cheeks sunk in quite a bit. I felt so sad that some tears actually came out. GW was asleep so we asked a nurse to wake him. He was groggy but very happy to see us. Even though he was physically deteriorating I could see that his mind was as sharp as even and his sense of humor was still there. I stuck my hand out to shake his hand and he held mine for a long time like he didn't want to let go. His hand felt cold and weak. I got emotional again and almost cried again but I held it in. I didn't want GW to worry so I put on a brave face and smiled. Before we left I told GW to get better soon and we'll be waiting for him at home. For the rest of the day I felt a bit melancholy and down. Seeing GW like that reminded me of how fleeting and fragile life is and it scared me.",3SEPORI8WOL8L6ZDZ99AWWEPFO1AZC,,0.0

When I left, I was feeling so bothered, so pressure, so paranoid that I didn't even tell them I was coming. My attitude about them was, ""well, here's you son - like it or lump it. Let me do my filial duty and get out of here."" When I saw them in person, everything was different. There was welcome surprise, big hugs, and really just gratitude for me showing up in the flesh. Plus, my mood was positive and peaceful, pretty much from start to finish. It really was a pleasure. It was such a good and unexpected experience that I plan on visiting again before too long. I don't know how things will be next time, but my goodness, that is my mother. As a son, you're supposed to visit your sick parents.",3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL8HUULX,3SNLUL3WO598VQW7QDZSOIFL8HUULX,0.0

The good thing about it was that we were even laughing together. Mom showed interest in what I had to say. I was able to share how things were progressing in my life and what I was aspiring to.

That makes her zodiac sign the crab and mine the ram, not meant to get along without a lot of work, but we get along fantastic - so much for that. She speaks quite directly, and it's very relaxing and reassuring. Wasn't so direct about that crush for a few months, though. I'd first started talking to her because I admired her art, and she admired my writing - not that you'd know it from this kind of diary entry. Bit more comfortable with fiction I suppose. Anyway, we'd spent a few months chatting online, flirting a bit but ambiguously so, you know, like you could read more or less into it, whichever way you liked. Anyway, we'd both developed massive crushed on each other of the course of chatting - though she's told me since that she'd been pining a bit even before we started talking, that was cute - so it was nice to finally have that stated. Feelings mutual. And it's only been a couple months, and it's a long distance thing, but it's been working unbelievably well since then. All the little things, waking up to texted good-mornings and listening to her voice saying good night every night, chatting while we watch shows together, sorting out travel plans. Really quite remarkable given that she's ridiculously out of my league. Talented, thoughtful, gorgeous, ambitious, much smarter than I am - she's incredible. And somehow she's enjoying spending time with me. Go figure.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG015VCKG,,0.0

He was riding his motorcycle on his way to his house when a box truck stopped harshly in front of him. He was checking his mirrors and when he looked back up he did not have enough time to slow down all the way. He hit the brakes as hard as he could and ended up hitting the back of the truck. His motorcycle went under the truck and his neck was the first point of contact with the truck's bumper. He broke his c7 vertebrae, and destroyed his larynx pharynx and most of everything in his neck. I was riding behind him and was able to stop in time. I am not trained in CPR or any type of emergency medical care so I just dumped my bike and got on the phone with 911. The truck behind us attempted to stop traffic from coming towards us. He was helevacced to the nearest hospital. En route to the hospital he died twice and was resuscitated. I picked my bike back up and essentially followed the helicopter to where the hospital was. When I got there things were not looking good and I worried my dad would be severely brain damaged or even dead. They eventually were able to stabilize him and put him in a medically induced coma. He was in the coma for 7 days and when he awoke there was no sign of brain damage. He made an incredible recovery over 18 days and was released from the hospital then.

He was seriously injured from the accident and had actually died and needed to resuscitated on his way to the hospital. I thought I would lose him. He had broken his C7 vertebrae, crushed his larynx, pharynx and paralyzed his vocal cords. During his stint at the hospital he was handling it well. He wasn't very happy about it but he was pushing through and just continued to be himself. Every day his voice is getting a little bit stronger and he is scheduled to get the tracheotomy taken out soon. This will relieve the family of a lot of the everyday nursing duties that we've shared. It will be a bit of a recovery time for him but the doctors think he is ready and he is beating all standards so far so we are not going to be ones to disagree with him. Right after he had a consultation he wanted to go to the motorcycle dealership to look at new bikes. He already has his eyes set on a new a one. I told him that when he was ready to buy a new one I would buy one with him too. Granted he will probably buy a much nicer bike than I will but is nice to be able to still share that with him. He won't be able to ride for a bit but we are both hopeful. It is very satisfying to see that even a huge accident wouldn't deter him from his love of motorcycles. He has been riding forever and we were all worried if he would become scared of them. I don't think any of us expected him to want to get back on so soon but he just loves them so much. I'm just glad he is progressing steadily and can keep looking to the future.",3SNVL38CI5E1PQXPJM2RFCG0BF7KCU,,0.0

It was unexpected but I thought this reflected well on my past performance as an employee. It appears that the organization is going through a restructure and my former employer thought my input and guidance would be useful during this challenging period. My former manager, who asked me to return as manager of a newly forming team, said he believed I would be a great asset in bringing old and new employees together to help drive the organization forward. He also said my old team had been affected by my retirement and their productivity was not quite as good as it had been under my leadership. Admittedly, I do miss my former colleagues and team but I do not miss the pressure of my former position and having new and harder targets to achieve on a regular basis - not only was it hard for me but even harder leading others to achieve. My former industry is becoming more and more competitive as new technologies are released and more talented people are attracted into the area. My former manager also offered me a significant pay rise and good bonus potential. I was very tempted by this offer especially as my 401k and social security could use the boost! That said there are many aspects of the job I don't want to repeat even with the temptation of potentially new ways of doing things. I was happy to retire as I was getting very tired and stressed by the demands of the organization and industry. I do not think I have the energy and ambition to tackle the more unpleasant aspects of the job. Still, the offer had me torn and I asked for a week to think things over. My former manager said that would be fine and he hoped I would return. During that week I called some former colleagues to find out what had been going on within the organization since I had retired. They all agreed, separately, that the industry has indeed become much more competitive and the organization was struggling to keep up, hence the restructure. Most commented that it had been and still was a difficult and stressful time. Some said they envied my retirement and wished they could do the same! The things my colleagues said helped me make up my mind to turn down the offer. I enjoy being retired too much to return to a highly stressful job. I love being able to spend much more time with my grandchildren and money isn't too tight. I don't have expensive tastes any way. I also enjoy spending time on my hobbies and not having to get up every morning at the same time.",,3SPJ033422PJH9SCXTK4BO86YRYYJF,0.0

My day got even worse when I tried to take my evening medications. I found that I was out of one of my meds. I can't recall if I ordered a refill. As bad as my memory is getting, I could have ordered it and not picked it up, or even picked it up and lost it. Searching the house reveals no sign of it. My memory has never been this bad. This is a risk to my life and well being. I have to figure out why this is happening, and do something about it. Something that really scares me is that this is the kind of medication you do not miss without suffering for it, and the pharmacy won't be open again until Monday. What if I picked it up already and can't get more? What if this medication is what's making me feel this way?

A few weeks later, we had a Memorial. Just some photos, food, stories swapped etc. It was very moving, and we all cried at some point. My sister was only 57, and it was suicide. Too young and so sad. We vowed that we would get together yearly to remember her. My niece lives fairly far away, as do the other people that were at the first one. This past year (June 2019 ), we all got together for another Memorial. We all met at a restaurant in Philadelphia where I live. It was a Greek place and it was a lunch gathering. We all chatted, and it was great to see everyone. I had made each person a sun-catcher out of glass beads and colored wire because my sister loved the sun. I didn't expect some of the reactions. Some people cried. After the restaurant, we went to a church that a family member belonged to and had desserts and coffee. I also made a memory box where everyone could write a memory they had of my sister, and then it was given  to my niece. It was especially sad for me because I hadn't seen my sister in over 10 years, we were estranged. I had tried many times to get her to come to Philly, and I asked if I could come and see her. She refused every time. I'd give anything just to see her again. I do believe in God and heaven, so I have hope that I will see her some day.

I turned away for a split second and next thing I know, he stood up and started to walk towards me! My other son, who is 5 years old, started yelling ""He's walking!"" I could not believe it! He was actually walking! Not just taking a step and falling. No, he was practically running! Okay, maybe not that fast, but they were definitely not baby steps. He had been taking a few steps here and there, walking with the assistance of us or the couch, but never just standing up on his own and walking! I was so excited! Maybe to excited because we were so loud yelling ""he's walking, o my goodness,"" that he fell shortly after. My husband had just went into the garage. He ran in the house, but had missed his first steps. He was sad that he missed it. We had him walk again for his Dad and so we could get it on video to send to our family. It was a wonderful moment and a memory that will of course stick with us forever. We were so excited to see our little one walking!",,3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLTFQE62,0.0

Their ceremony was in a beautiful cathedral with high vaulted ceilings and stunning stained glass windows. Their reception was right down the road at the local wildlife park. They had fairy lights strung up through the canopy of trees over the dining tables. A little dance floor was set up where the DJ was playing exciting music as the guests ate. My husband and I sat with each other having a few cocktails, enjoying the ambiance of the evening. We danced a little, ate a little, and enjoyed time with our lovely friends. My absolute favorite part of the evening was when my adoring husband took me off to the side of the gathering where it was a little quiet. He took me into his arms and we danced under the stars. He whispered how much he loved me and how happy every moment spent with me made him. On our friend's special day this amazing man still made me feel like the bell of the ball. We kissed under the night sky with the faint echo of music and laughter in the background. Eventually our little escapade into the trees had to end. The rest of the evening went off without a hitch. There was much laughter and my sister caught the bouquet! It looks like she will be the next lucky lady. I will always remember that little moment we had together; it made me realize truly how lucky I am to have this amazing man in my life.",,3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLWY5E6M,0.0

This was his first visit home after enlisting in the Army. I was so excited to see him and I was so relieved when he was finally sitting beside me in the truck for the drive home. I was so filled with pride when I saw my son in his Army uniform standing in the airport. He looked so grown up, more so than one would expect after just the passing of several months. I can tell just by how he stands straighter and taller, with his shoulders back and his chin held high, that he is proud of himself too. Starting in the truck on the ride home, I was so full of questions and so eager to hear about my son's experiences. I needed reassurance, as a mom, that my son was doing all right and that the Army was treating him well and fairly. Seeing my son looking fit and happy did a lot to give me this reassurance and to dispel the worries that I had been feeling after hearing of problems my son had been having with certain people during Basic Training. At one point, it looked uncertain he would even successfully complete the training. But now, seeing him, I knew everything would be okay. As my son shared his stories, he could laugh about some of those experiences with the perspective gained by the passing of time. Now, he was collecting his own stories, and I'm sure there would be more to come. I could laugh as well, instead of feeling the ache of wanting to protect my son from pain, emotional and physical. Seeing my son now gave me such hope for his future. It made me feel like everything would be okay, and helped balance the worries and headaches my son had given me as a rather troubled kid, drifting without any concrete goal in mind, after high school.",3SUWZRL0MZZ9N9WED9ELVHBLM2OE63,,0.0

I had worked as a server in a nice family restaurant for thirteen years, after owning my own business for twenty years and retiring to go RVing.  I never thought of my serving job as really hard work, because I enjoyed the people I worked with, enjoyed the customers, was proud of the product I sold, and in general had a good time working about 25 hours per week. I retired for the second time because I am just too darned old to carry heavy trays and do my share of the cleaning and side work which each employee is expected to finish each day as part of their job. I was really touched and surprised when, on my last day of work all my coworkers gave me a small party, with gifts and cake.  My manager gave me a gift certificate for Whole Foods, and another supervisor bought me a B-B gun to scare rabbits out of my garden.  About two years before retiring I bought some land outside of town and decided to try some sustainable farming techniques and permaculture experiments.  I sold my RV and put a small home om the land.  I planned to build a greenhouse right after retirement, but I got sick and could not really do anything on my farm for two months.  I was really depressed and was about to give up.  Then one morning I got a phone call from a co-worker and friend, asking if I was going to be home that day. About an hour after the call, I looked out my front window to see a caravan of pickups and cars coming down my road.  I walked out the door to see over half my co-workers unloading building suppiles from their trucks, and picnnic supplies with a barbeque grill from various SUVs and cars.  Over the next three days every single worker in the restaurant spent hours in their off time to build me a beautiful greenhouse, a carport and a fenced in area for a garden. I never knew that friends like this existed.  I hope I have helped out when needed.  I hope I have done my share to assist my co-workers when they needed help.  But I never expected the support and help I got from these wonderful friends, and hope I can someday pay it forward.",3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY161QH9RN,3T111IHZ5FCLEW3HXM1XEY161QH9RN,0.0

I was shipped out to New York to get training on one of their new operating systems. This trip was nothing like the ones I am used to. New York was very busy. Not only traffic but commuters, mostly in suits. I was excited to visit New York to see the city. The most memorable part of my visit was seeing Times Square. If I'm being honest, the statue of liberty was surprising. I had no idea it was that beautiful. It was one of the most beautiful scenery I've ever seen. But back to the training. It was a really cool experience. This new operating system is like nothing I've ever seen. The projection value of this operating system could change my life. Using the new capabilities of this system, the company I work for can make millions if not billions and you know what that means for me. I might become a millionaire. The experience that I was given, visiting New York and testing this new system is one that I'll never forget. Great things are ahead for me. Hopefully.",,3TAYZSBPLMUMFRIVR2MNULYOGIYS21,0.0

What we ended up receiving was a torrential downpour, 60 mile per hour gusts of wind, hail, strong lightning, and a power outage throughout much of our city. The storm blasted through the city in less than 1 hour but left in it's wake thousands of downed trees, power lines, and many flooded streets. Personally, at my house, it knocked out power, blew down a wall of planters where we had a herb garden planted, and damaged some branches on a tree in the front yard, but we were luckily spared any larger damage. After the storm had abated we decided to head to the restaurant, not knowing the extent of the damage the city had faced. Driving down to the restaurant we had to navigate downed tree branches, electrical lines, flooding, dead traffic lights, and emergency vehicles. When we made it to the restaurant and they were out of power as well, and wouldn't be able to open until power was restored, and nobody knew when that would happen. Fortunately, cell phone networks still worked, so we started to organize and decide on a new plan. My brother still had electricity up where he lives, so we ended up driving to my brother's house and ordering a bunch of pizza from Dominoes and chowing down on cheap pizza and just partying with the whole family and having a good time. It was a memorable experience and one that, I feel, will stick with me much more vividly than if we just had a nice dinner at the restaurant.",3TEM0PF1Q6J9HSWZFPNKGYJ9G03D07,,0.0

The last time we were at a park with our daughter and Rex helped us find her when we lost track of her as she rode her bike in the park. We heard Rex barking from a distant and we went running towards the direction of the sound. We were happy to find Rex and Stacy together under a tree.  On asking Stacy why she didn't come back, she announced that her bike had spoiled and could not move. She trusted that somehow we would go looking for her. It was such a good moment and we loved Rex even more. We have even bought him a new collar. It has his name written on it.  Rex is so promising.   There was this memorable night when burglars came home and were about to break in. Rex with all his courage took on them and managed to pin one down who is helping the police with investigations. Rex has become one of us and we value him so much. He has proved to be a member of the family and with a lot of love. In many instances, Rex has proved to be capable beyond our expectations.      Though he is proving his ability, we intend to retain the trainer for the full time intended. Rex is one of the finest German Shepherd i have come across.

It has been a hard, last 6 months! I had to work extremely hard the last little while to keep my grades up, especially when my father passed away. I almost fell into a deep depression but with the help of my friends and family, I was able to pull out of it. The visit from my mother made all the difference in the world. I can see the strength, hope and courage she displays and her encouragement to me during this time -when she is hurting so much herself- really has helped me turn a corner in my grief. She has helped me understand that my father is not truly gone, he will always be here in our memories. So, I started today with a fresher, happier outlook, and I believe I received divine confirmation that everything will be ok, by several things that happened today. I was walking from my dorm to my first class and something caused me to look up. It was a beautiful day and not a cloud in the sky, but I plainly saw not one, but two rainbows! And the were just as clear as day! And that wasn't the end of it either -as today progressed, other things happened! I found seven pennies after my fifth class! My dad's birthday was the seventh of May! Then, after it got dark this evening, something caught my eye out the window. I looked and saw three shooting stars right in a row! Three was my dad's favorite number! Now I know, my dad is not really gone and he will be here by my side even though I can't see him, and everything is going to be alright. I'm really looking forward to seeing the rest of my family next week for my graduation ceremony!",,3TESA3PJ32W9O09JHN9LXLDG4YEMM1,0.0

I recall the day we left for her move in day.  i thought it was going to be tear filled and sad, but there was more excitement and forward thinking on the way out to Buffalo NY.  She was excited to start her new life away from the day to day home life and start moving towards her academic and professional goals in he new life going forward.  We found that she joined a couple of groups at school related to her chosen pre-dental profession and related academics in sciences and math.  She also is involved in a networking group to stay up to date on changes and trends in dental fields and orthodontics.  i'm excited for her and happy to see her drive and ambition so early on in her collegiate career.  As we reflected back on the month or so building up to moving her off to school, my wife and I seemed to realize that our feelings, though justified, were more about how we felt and our anxiousness about her leaving and not really about how she felt and what her ambitions are,  I am glad we found that she was looking forward to this new life and that she was nervous like us but seems to have it under control.  She has a roommate and other friends in the same pre-dental studies and they work well together and have a study group.  That makes me proud as a parent and glad to see that my worries were for nothing and she is so well adjusted to college life.  High school seems so long ago and the strides she has taken in the past couple of months are impressive.  Maybe it is because of necessity but nonetheless she is ahead of the curve related to others I have seen and heard about at her stage of the game.  As parents we have gone from worrying stressed out and nervous people to proud and excited parents.  The transition has been painless and she has led the way without our interaction.  I think the most impressive part is that she is not the same person at school as she is at home.  She is very quiet, sort of lazy, and not proactive at home and it seems she is the ultra opposite away at school.  I would like to say it is like that for most parents a they see their oldest grow up fast and do well but some friends and neighbors have some stories that would make me cringe at what they tell me if it is true.",3TPWUS5F8ANSKQR680LU3NAVZP1WCU,,0.0

It has been about 10 years since I've last seen him.  The purpose of me visiting was to see him again and help him out around his place.  He needed a lot of his old stuff sold or tossed out because he didn't need it anymore, but he had so much that it was overwhelming to him.  I had a few garage sales for him and organized everything he had.  Both of us really cleared up his place, and now his garage is actually a garage where he can park his car, rather than a storage unit.  It was great seeing him again.  After we finished with his place we were able to relax.  I took him out to many treated dinners and we enjoyed watching some old movies together.  Where he lives is pretty laid back.  There isn't much to do there except eat really.  It's not a very big city.  Most of the time we would hang out around his place, but we would go out and get some coffee and have a nice talk.  I stayed there for three weeks and we really got a lot done.  he was grateful for my help and it was good to see me again.  I have another planned trip out there later this year and I look forward to that as well.",3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LEG1WD,3TMSXRD2X7M8XNH8S3WAMRR4LEG1WD,0.0

My fiance proposed to me for the second time, because he didn't like how he did it the first time. I was standing in the kitchen, and he came home and he said he wanted to speak with me. He got down on his knee in front of me and he took a small jewelry box out of his pocket. He took my hand and he said to me that he had always been disappointed by the way he asked me to marry him the first time. He didn't really have a ring, and he kind of just blurted it out awkwardly. I didn't really mind that much, and was still in love with him and excited to be engaged, but I knew what he meant, I was nervous the first time he asked me and I hesitated for far too long. He opened the box and there was a small, plain ring inside with just a few small diamonds on a white gold band. I loved it immediately. I had previously explained to him that I liked more practical and less flashy jewelry but whenever we had looked at rings, I got the impression he didn't understand my taste. I was so surprised at how perfect it was, and how well he seemed to understand everything I told him, and then he explained to me that the diamonds were from his grandmothers wedding ring that she had left to him when she died, and he had had them reset for or me in a plain band. I loved it even more. He asked me to marry him again and I cried a little bit and said yes. The way he proposed the first time would have been fine. We still would have still been in love, and gotten married and been happy, but this is a nicer story to tell our children and friends and families.",3TOK3KHVJU4E30N8QXM9675VKZGO7L,,0.0

It was a happy and emotional occasion. I was happy to be moving on to other opportunities, but it was also bittersweet as I would miss my students. Some I had watched grow up. There were happy goodbyes, a few tears, and knowing I probably wouldn't see most of the people I worked with anymore. There were some surprises that day when parents brought me gifts and cards telling me how much they had appreciated me as their child's teacher. Some of those parents I had no idea how they felt, so it was very nice knowing I had made an impact. One parent even cried as she gave me a hug. It was completely unexpected! As I got in my car that after noon after taking the last of my things, I knew my time at the school had made a difference. But I was excited to drive off and end that adventure and get ready for my next. I still hear from a few parents who have become my friends through the years. I also hear about how my former students are doing. Teaching is not an easy job. Some days you just want to throw in the towel. But at the end of the day it's very rewarding. I will miss it.",3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z,3TR2532VIQGHYPI6RAPCSXODYEBJ6Z,0.0

I was traveling through Florida and the call was for a position in the Florida Keys. I had always dreamed of spending some time in time in the Keys and this was the perfect opportunity. I accepted the job and began work shortly after arriving. I was impressed with the scenery and the wildlife in the area and I was exposed to this due to the fact that I worked outdoors. I was surrounded by a lot people all of the time. I made many new friends and made a lot of memories. I enjoyed time on the water, under the water and attended many social events. I was able to help with the social events by setting up and working booths, and helping people. I spent a lot of one on one time with new friends who were always good about seeing that I was enjoying myself and the environment. I enjoyed many boat rides and went scuba diving and fishing. Everyday brought new experiences. One day at the boat ramp I spotted a pelican standing in front of a truck that was pulling a boat out of the water. The truck driver seemed annoyed by the bird and was going to force it out of the way with his truck.  I walked right up to the bird and realized something was wrong with it. I carefully pick it up and moved it out of harms way. A couple of us then arranged for the wildlife department to pick the bird up and care for it. It was a very up close and personal experience. I would end most of my days in the Keys by watching the sunset. They were like none I had ever witnessed and I think they are one of the things I will miss them the most.",3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP93PE,3TPZPLC3M1YENHYM3LWYIQY5YP93PE,0.0

However, after reading the requirement that was the first thing came in my mind. This happened almost three months ago while I was away from home. I loved my grandfather so much. I was so close to him. He used to tell me a lot of old stories about him and I used to enjoy them a lot. We always had so much fun together. So I had to go out of state for some work related issues for about two weeks or so. In that time my grandfather was really fit and had no health issues whatsoever. However, after few days I got a call from my mom that the grandfather just had a heart attack and he is in ICU now. I had no words to say. I got so panic and did not know what to do. I went straight to the airport and found out the flight just left and the next flight was in about 3-4 hours. I had no choice but to wait for the flight. Those three to four hours for me were like three to four years that day. I just wanted to go to the hospital and see him. Anyway finally, after waiting for couple hours I took the flight and went straight to the hospital. When I reached there I saw that everyone crying and hugging each other. I asked my mom what happened, where is grandpa? Is he okay? She said “he is no more, he left us”. When I heard this I felt like I lost my best friend. A friend that I used to share everything of my life. That was a big loss of my life. I still miss him a lot in so many cases and still cry remembering his stories.",3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZM8GTWI,0.0

The whole family was so excited to get a our new puppy. We had spent months trying to find the perfect one to bring into our home. Then we finally found Louie, a perfect little springer spaniel. The only problem was that he was a couple of states over. We planned a road trip to go pick him up, and it was going to take us about 8 hours to get there. We were all super excited and began our trip on Friday morning. Dad didn't check the car for any problems as it's usually fine, but we all definitely regret not convincing him to. We were only 2 hours into the ride when the car started to smell a little a funky. We didn't think much of it since we just wanted to see our cute new puppy. Then after another hour the check engine light came on and that was a sign for the worst. Only 3 hours into the trip and the engine was billowing smoke all over the highway. Turns out the radiator blew and it wasn't going to be possible to keep driving. The owner of the puppy said we had to be there as it was a first come first serve deal and the puppy was definitely wanted by more people than us. Without a way to keep on going, Dad called up AAA and had them tow the car. They couldn't tow the car to where we were going and then back, so we had to cancel the trip and go home. Because of this we missed on the opportunity to get the puppy. Since then we've been very demotivated to try and find a new puppy.",,3TVRFO09GL10CUQ2VIAF8PEP2ZFLXK,0.0

They say that you never know about someone truly until you live with them. We have been getting along great! I couldn't imagine living with anyone else now. Another benefit is that we are saving more money now than we had before. Moving out on our own really helped my mental state  too. I was locked in to a state of depression I couldn't shake off. I needed a change in my life. The move is exactly what I needed. If I had stayed where I was living I would still be unhealthy. Now I eat better and don't drink as much. The move really changed my life!,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZECWWT1,3TVSS0C0E2M967THUMGKSXAZECWWT1,0.0

The reason it was so memorable was for starters it caused a fight within my family.  Since my mother is sick and my father is the primary caregiver I had to ask my siblings if they would take care of her for a week while I took my father on the trip. They weren't happy about this. It caused a big argument.  In the end they agreed.  We set a date for my father and boyfriend to pack up and head 8 hours north with my father's fishing boat which he hadn't taken out in years.  My father is 80 years old.  He grew up in WI and misses trips tremendously. It made me feel goo inside to take him.  You never know when it may be their last. We spent the trip fishing, telling stories, visiting old friends and eating as much as we could.  Lake time was super important so we made sure to get up early and spend a lot of time fishing the lake.  Although we didn't catch a lot of fish due to the time of year, we still have a great time.  It was well worth it to see that big grin on my father's face.  In the end everyone pitched in to give a really nice memorable gift to my father.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IXDYQ1X,0.0

It's been over a month now yet it is still just as upsetting now as it was then. Every time I'm on the subway I find myself looking around constantly, scanning everyone else up and down. I'm even thinking about what I should do if someone starts approaching me, where can I run to, where is the nearest exit, or is there anything I can just hide behind. Every now and then I see someone who looks like the mugger. It startles me every time. Even if its in broad daylight or in some big store with dozens of other people in it. I know this is insane but I think he may be following me, maybe lying in wait to do it all over again. And this I really hate, I used to have no problem with chatting up people in public, no problem with making new friends, but now I try to avoid it all costs. I just walk around with a hoodie up and headphones in, hoping no one notices me or walks towards me or anything like that.  I'm pretty much running when in public just so some other mugger will have less of a chance to exploit me. I haven't worn what I was wearing that night again. Not even the shoes. I should probably just throw all that clothing away, even seeing it sitting in the corner of the room is too much. It just brings up those memories all over that run and run like a video stuck on repeat. I'm not sure if I should donate it to goodwill or something - I don't know why I find myself thinking like this, but it's almost like everything to do with that night is tainted. Why should I give something that's been ruined like that to someone in need? I'm actually thinking of moving out of the city now. If something like this happens again I just couldn't handle it. I can barely handle it now. Things weren't all that stressful before the mugging, but now I'm almost having panic attacks just putting on my coat and tying my shoes. Everyone has noticed that I'm not going out anymore. Everyone at work can see that I'm almost falling apart. And I just can't stand going to work, climbing down the stairs at that same station. It doesn't matter what time it is, even when there are a hundred people on the platform.",,3TUI152ZZC93DQLMGUX4U29IGKWQ1S,0.0

The amount of love that I never imagined having blew me away. When she was brought out, I remember the look she had. It was almost as if she was looking at me and could see every notion of my being. I know she couldn't see, but it sure felt like it. Her eyes were looking directly at me and she didn't whimper one bit. That day is a day I could never forget.

Earlier that evening I had suddenly gotten my tax return in my account. I immediately sent a good portion of the money to my mom as me and her had agreed. I immediately called my best friend and asked if she wanted to hang out. She said yes under the condition that I'd leave at 12am. So, I took an uber to her place in the city and we hung out. I was quite drunk when I left, ended up talking to a random guy who I end up going to 7/11 with. While inside, in line, a different person walks in, demands my wallet and stabs me three times in my breast, arm and side with a box cutter. I was taken to a local hospital, scanned, was crying, and then was told they needed to do exploratory surgery on my abdomen. Now a few interesting things happen when you find yourself the victim of a violent crime. Firstly, now I had to recover from surgery. From there, I had to have quite an intimidating interview with the police department in the city. Of course, despite the fact this happened on camera in a store in the richer part of the city they did not catch the guy. Now, I found myself having to deal with the psychological horror of yet another near death experience, and still dealing with it (as this happened roughly 6 months ago.) Finding a therapist has literally took me this long. But, I had to find a silver lining which is, now I can stay on therapy if I lose my insurance (I'm currently unemployed and am on medicaid) due to our state's victims compensation fund. Luckily, I have an amazing support system and I had a lot of different people reach out, but, it's still a long process.",3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DAK8A4UD,0.0

It was the first time I was on my own, really on my own and I had to make friends and interact with a lot of people which makes me nervous. I've always wanted to just do my own thing while in school, I never liked doing group projects or having to get up and make a speech. In college, all of these issues I have in school, I would have to be doing in order to pass my classes and in order to graduate. The first few years in college were so stressful and hard that I thought about quitting a lot. Luckily, I made some friends and they helped me get through these difficult moments. I wouldn't participate in group projects and would pretend sick all the time and I would never volunteer to make a speech in front of my class or raise my hand to answer questions. I always sat in the back and focused on myself and my own work. The last few years my friends and my family came to my aid many times and without their help, I wouldn't have been able to work in group projects or raise my hand in class. With my friends and my family helping me through the years, they taught me to get passed my fears and go all in. That's exactly what I did, I made myself do uncomfortable things that could get me through my public fears. My friends and family helped me work hard and even tutored me throughout the years. I really didn't think I would be able to conquer these fears I had in college. I felt like they overrun my life and that I would have to seek professional help in order to get through them, which I didn't have the money for. I even told my friends and family how I felt and I told them not to help because there is no way I would get over these fears and I probably wouldn't graduate because these fears held me back. My friends and family eventually talked me into letting them try to help. I didn't think they were helping at first but as the years went on, they never gave up on me and I made sure, since they were taking their time to help me, I would put all my effort into letting them help me and not to give up. I never gave up and they never gave up on me and I was finally able to graduate school because of the help they gave me.",,3TXD01ZLD53CXIPMKL0B21DADW8U46,0.0

Finally the day arrived which was 3 months ago. I reached Universal Studios in Florida which was really exciting to me. I visited the Volcano Bay water park, Universal Studios and Adventure island. I rode the Incredible Hulk roller coaster which really surprised me and made fear in me, but it was an wonderful experience. I also ate at some nice restaurants including NBC Sports Bar and Grill.

We had to decide on an exact date so we started getting everyone's schedules together. It was going to be hot but August was the choice! It was too expensive to fly so we chose to drive. Took us 10 hours to get there. Weather was very nice. We went to the big water park first, Volcano Bay. The kids loved it. The next day we stayed and hung out at the resort and swam in the pool mostly. We played some games and went bowling. Next two days we went to Universal Studios park and then Adventure Island.

I tried to point out to her some of the ways we could donate a portion of it away and why, and she was trying to explain her reasoning as well. We had been have marital problems for awhile but i knew in that moment sitting at the table i had to make a decision about our future, i knew she was not happy and neither was I. So i tried to calmly gather my feelings and courage to tell her that it was not working and we needed to separate. I knew it was going to be hard and heartbreaking but i also knew in the future it would be what was best for her and me. I had packed up my bag for the night and said goodbye to my son, as i drove to my friends house it was one of the hardest decisions I've had to make in my life, i was trying to keep it together and try not to turn around and go back. one of the hardest part for me to accept also was not being able to see my son for awhile. he is very young and i knew he would not understand what was happening or why. A few days later her parents came to our home to pack up some of her stuff to take with. I remember them asking what the plan was moving forward and me trying to explain to them what my plan was that i knew of so far but that i did not have all the answers. I remember i took my son for a few days while they packed up and left behind what she didn't want. we only lived in a apartment so there wasn't a whole lot of possessions to take. After she had finished packing and left with our son, I walked into our apartment knowing that life would never be the same again, that I would have to sacrifice time spent with my son but knowing that if i could just hold onto what would be better in the future for everyone that thats what i should do. It would be better for him to grow up with both of us happy instead of us staying together and being miserable just for the sake of appearances. It was a difficult decision but the right one.",,3TXWC2NHN0CXFB3UCB124862MOF9SH,0.0

We saw a lot of old and forgotten  structures. However, most importantly, we saw a great local band. They were playing in a quiet alley. Perhaps doing a practice run before a local gig. We stood and watched them. It was such great music. They sang and played graciously. I took a video of it, and showed my friends.

I never felt like I was “illegal”. That is until I was 16 and it was time to get a job. Fortunately around that time DACA was started, and I have been legally working for about 8 years. Last year in July I married my long time boyfriend. Then in October we filed to fix my status. All this to say when I received the case approval letter I was overcome with joy. And for someone who is not usually very emotional publicly, it was extremely moving. Although it really didn’t fix anything I suppose being so close to never having to worry about renewing a work permit. Even more the thought of actually being able to meet my family outside of the U.S was very impactful. I was at work, I remember I worked with Rosendo one of my employees who is the same nationality and also able to work because of DACA. I received a message from my mom with a picture of the letter. Suddenly that was it I was beaming, bouncing with joy. Having someone who understood around really added to the experience. I high-fived him and my eyes were a bit watery. I can’t  imagine how I’ll feel when this is all over...which is hopefully very soon.",,3TYCR1GOTD5PHPQHW0Y05AU08A8ZLA,0.0

He needed to get his new guitar set up. I wasn't sure if I was going to buy a new guitar or not, but I didn't put the idea out of my mind. When we got to the store, I asked to look at the guitars. First off, he showed me a new one that he had in that had been selling very well. It was made of a beautiful kind of wood and had a crisp sound. But it was also one of the cheapest guitars in the store. It didn't have all the flashy features that some of the pricier ones had. No built in tuner, no acoustic/electric, no cutaway. So I kept trying the other guitars, trying to find one that sounded better. I wanted my guitar to be as impressive as possible. But I kept coming back to the first one I had tried. Finally, I gave up trying to one up what was clearly the best guitar in the store. So I bought that one.

I supervised a staff of 6 associates. In the first week of May, our company let us know that they will be shutting our department down and we will all be losing our jobs. The next couple months were stressful and sad for us. On one hand, there was the fear of not being able to find a job after our end date materialized. On the other hand, we had all worked with each other for over a decade and knew that our time together was coming to an end. These past few months will definitely leave a mark on my life. The emotional roller coaster I felt on a daily basis is something I have never experienced before. One day I would feel confident and think that my life was meant to take this turn. The very next day I would feel defeated and incompetent with unreasonable expectations for myself. I would come into work as our end date approached and feel sad every time I had a laugh or a meaningful conversation with a colleague. It would make me feel awful that I would not be seeing these people again. Unfortunately, it also showed me that some people who you think are very close to you are really not honest people in your life who care for you the way you care for them. I saw this in my manager. She did not bother to speak to a single one of us in the last month we were employed. Not so much as a ""goodbye"" or ""good job"" or simply ""nice knowing you"". it really hurt me that she would treat the staff that way. I expected more from her.

I was one course away from finishing the first section of 2 and i could not pass the quiz for the life of me. You get three attempts before the boss has to ask for the course to be reset. I had to use that twice. With 10 days to go and my boss going on vacation I had to ask to come in on a Saturday to do the course. First thing was that daunting course. I passed it right away with a little bit of my bosses help. It ended up taking me all of that Saturday when i was expecting about an hour or so. It was now off to the final.

But a note in your birthday card is up there with really bad ways to find out. Especially when it arrives the day before your birthday and you had big plans. A trip out of time, tickets to a concert and nice hotel room suddenly seemed about as appealing as a plate of rotten fish. My Mom has always been there for me through all my mistakes and failures. Always trying to help, although never really having the right words. But just knowing that at least one person was one my side was usually enough to get me through to the next thing. The card and the note hit me like a train. It didn't really say how serious or treatable the cancer might be. So I was left wondering about her health as I  broke the news to my friend going with me that the trip was off. Although I live a short distance from my parents, I don't go over there anymore because of my father being such a jerk. I got tired of the fighting and insults and vowed to never set foot there again. My brother had wisely made the decision 25 years earlier, so I knew he would have no info either. I was filled with dread and fear as I picked up the phone to call.  They say no news is good news, but not so much when it's your Mom's health. Of course my call goes to voicemail, which further increases my anxiety. The next day my Mom calls me back to say that she has a tumor but they think they will be able to operate and remove it. Fortunately they don't find any cancer in the bloodstream or lymph nodes. Having been through a breast cancer scare with my best friend a year early I knew this was a good sign. Yet still I was mostly paralyzed with a foreboding sense of doom and a real trepidation that my biggest supporter in life might not be around too much longer. As each day ticked off until the operation I could barely think of anything else and could barely get any work done. When it was over, the doctors said that they were very successful in getting the tumor out, and they had no concern that it had spread but chemo would still be necessary.",,3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQ3U3NRW,0.0

I decided I wanted to change careers and needed to advance me education. It was a little nerve wracking to apply for college again. Getting all the paperwork and transcripts together is a tedious process. The staff at the school I wanted to attend was very helpful and made the process as easy as possible. They seemed happy to help and enthusiastic on my behalf. When I started classes  I quickly got into the swing of things and started enjoying my studies.   My teachers were helpful. I was not used to the amount of computer work but with their help I caught up to the younger students very quickly. Once I got into the swing of things the experience really took off. I enjoyed the assignments and really felt like I was doing something good for myself. I started looking forward to the next class I would take. It seemed like finishing my degree was a feasible goal for the first time in years. It was not easy to balance the school work with all my other responsibilities but it was the start of a very satisfying experience.  I feel good about my future and I know I made the right decision.,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZN0WM,3U088ZLJVLF8QYWQWKSA8M8UQZN0WM,0.0

I had awoken early, had breakfast at the motel and then drove downtown to visit an art museum I had been planning to see. I arrived early and was one of the first ones to enter. I noticed five other people waiting, two couples, one in their 50s the other couple younger, perhaps in thier 30s. There was also an older woman, she looked like she could be in her 80s. She wore a coat although it wasn't that cold out and walked with a distinctive wooden cane. The two couple went in as soon as the doors were unlocked and I held the door for the older woman to enter. The museum had a special showing of photographs from famous artist in Canada. I took my time walking through and viewing the work. On the third floor I noticed the old woman standing in front of two photographs by a woman photographer (I'll leave her name out) and I smiled at her as I passed behind the old woman and glanced at the photographers name and saw there were two photos of her work. I continued on and then went to the basement cafe for some coffee and a pastry. I was there about 30 minutes. I decided to walk through the museum again. On the third floor I noticed the old woman still standing in the same place. I approached her and after making eye contact, I ask her if she was OK?""Oh yes, quite,"" she said, ""I'm just admiring my granddaughter's photographs.""""Oh, this photograph is your granddaughter?"" I asked.""She was,"" said the old woman, ""but I'm afraid she died three years ago, an accident, she was 37.""I told her how terribly sorry I was and then she told me she's lived in that town, but her granddaughter worked in Montreal,  so she only saw her every few years.

I'm a major homebody nowadays - what with having moved away from family, friends, civilization as I had always known it. I don't explore, I don't go out, I like comfy socks and TV shows. I live in the most rural area I've ever seen in my life after growing up in the suburbs of Philadelphia. Talk about culture shock. But anyway, the last time I'd visited Pennsylvania, she had talked about doing an Escape Room as a team building thing for work and I expressed how much I wanted to try one of those. So even though I didn't know what I wanted to do after my birthday, my mom found an Escape Room in a nearby city. She booked it and we went. So this being my first Escape Room, I had no idea what to expect. Mom sent me the list of the ""scenarios"" and said we should do an easier one since it was my first, but the one that struck my fancy was the one where I was supposed to be an FBI agent - the hardest one. I said, ""I hear what you're saying, but I want to be an FBI agent!"" So that's the one we did. And we did really well. At first there were so many different things that could be puzzle pieces that I was literally running from corner to corner wondering where to start. That took more time than it needed to, but once the first puzzle got solved it was pretty smooth sailing. We were in the room with three teenagers who seemed a little shy. Having worked retail, I tried to introduce myself and get their names because - you know, team building. It took a little while for them to really start engaging with us.  The whole thing went by in a blur and I honestly barely remember the entire process, I just know I had a great time and that we got the very, very last piece of the puzzle - a book with the code to unlock the door - when the clock was at 30 seconds. At this point, we weren't thinking as much as we should have been anymore and all but ignored the telling part of the clue that revealed the page of the book the code would be on. I was proud for almost getting out though, I think we definitely would have done if we didn't get frantic. Afterwards my husband told me that he loved seeing me like that. I had no idea what he was talking about. ""You were so amazing in there, you took charge of the situation and told people what you thought and I loved it."" I didn't realize how naturally I'd fallen back into my Assistant Manager role where I knew what to do and how it needed to get done, but it felt really good. It was a much needed reminder that I have valuable problem solving skills and leadership skills that I can apply when given the opportunity.",3U0SRXB7CER63Y7BYWK2WZWQXEZRNU,,0.0

I celebrated it with a party with my friends. At the baptism, everyone kept congratulating and told me I had made one of the best decisions of my life. During the baptism, one would be dipped into water and that dipping into water signifies that one is dead to his past way of life. When I came out of the water, it signified that from that day henceforth, I was dedicating my life to serve Jehovah and to be obedient to him no matter what he asks of me. The baptism was not a hurried decision. I had been studying with Jehovah's Witnesses for more than two years before I decided that I wanted to get baptized. I had learned much about Jehovah, his word the Bible, and what it means to be a christian from Jehovah's Witnesses. When I decided to get baptized, the brother studying with me was very happy but I was happier. On the day of my baptism, I called all my friends to witness the event. My family also came to the Assembly hall. I must say that it was a very memorable day for me. I was very happy that day. I took lots of pictures and selfies so that the memory would remain with me for a very long time. That Saturday in April is one that I will never forget in a hurry. I must say that this is not my first time to undergo any baptism. But this baptism was the first where I was getting baptized with the full consciousness of what the symbolism involved and where I had the freedom to choose to do so. I love Jehovah and decided to serve him that is why I got baptized that day.",3U84XHCDIDZTJHJWQ8ZJJTSPE0TZ4D,,0.0

I've been working with a Blue-headed macaw for that past 4 months, hand raising him since he was only 5 weeks old.  He was the first BH Macaw we were ever able to hatch at my facility so he got some special treatment when he got into human care.  This little guy had free range of the building once he began flying.  It go to the point where we had to put him in the kitchen since he would get himself in to some pretty high up spots where we couldn't reach him.  So after Azul began flying, we decided it was time to start training him.  Let's just say that at the beginning he was not a fan of his restricted time.  In order to work with him we needed him first to learn to step up onto our hand on cue.  So he didn't get the spoiled treatment of being allowed to fly when he wanted in our kitchen.  The first few days, he would try to bite our hands when ever we put it near him.  So Azul would then get to fly around without stepping on our hand first, as we'd pull our hand out of the cage and he'd take that opportunity to gain his freedom.  Eventually though through mostly my effort, and a little diet modification, I got Azul to accept my hand being near his perch without him biting me.  Then I began to teach him how to lift up his foot so he can signal to us he is interested in coming out.  Every a few more days of this work he finally began to put a foot on my hand, not without trying to bite me right after, but baby steps.  After we got over this phase of biting, we reached the point when he would place his feet on my hand and receive a nice little treat for doing that.  Then he got his chance to fly around the kitchen in all its freedom for a few hours until we needed him to go back.  With lots of hard work Azul learned that he could get what he wanted by stepping out nicely and not trying to knaw on the hand that feeds him.",3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ820IQ0O,,0.0

We decided to talk my parents to get some tips on how to go about. Once we were about to start potty training him, we made a time-table, which mostly based on when at first it was fun.  We thought everything was going great, we were having fun introducing the potty to him and demonstrating when he is supposed to use the potty. After the first week there was no improvement, we still were highly motivated to keep going, as were still had other methods and processes to try. After two more weeks it became clear that he was not improving in anyway, no matter the process we tried, even when we tried rewarding him he still did not improve. My wife and I then decided to go online for some updated information about potty training, because at that point we were already frustrated. We found some information which we applied. After the application and there was some slight improvement, but it was far from the main goal. We finally caved after about two months and we had to higher a professional. Hiring the professional was not cheap, but we had to make the sacrifice, also we were already emotionally exhausted. After about two weeks of hiring the professional there was some significant improvement. Till today we still wonder what we did wrong.",,3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ8BTZQ00,0.0

Azul was hatched back in February and I have been hand feeding him since March when he was pulled from his nest box.  Having to feed him every 2 hours was hard and stressful, but after today that stress and hard work finally payed off!  Now that he has been on solid food since May, we've been trying to start his training to fly, but in order to do that, we need him to willingly step out of his enclosure and onto our hands.  We've been letting him learn to fly by letting him out of his enclosure and to just hang out in our prep kitchen while we work on cutting up fruits and vegetables for the the other birds.  Azul has been allowed to do whatever he wanted since about the end of May, but now that it's July, it is time for him to start his formal training.  The first thing I had to teach him was how to step onto my hand for a piece of food.  It was a struggle at first because he always wanted to play with our hand instead of offering a foot.  So when we'd place our hand out he would instead try to bite it to elicit a response from us (usually we'd would scratch his head so he didn't know why my hand was in front of his foot.)   For the first week of July I would place my hand by his perch and say ""Step up"" and if he moved towards my hand or lifted his foot, I would give him a piece.  Then when he got good at that, I would do the same thing, however instead for him to move towards my hand to reward him, I waited until he was fully placing a foot on my hand before he got his treat.  This past week I have been working daily with him and he has been progressing little by little.  Just on Monday he though about lifting the other foot off the perch.  Unfortunately I had to skip his training these past few days due to how busy we have been so Azul hasn't gotten any practice for the past three days.  I was expecting when I got into work today and got ready to train him that Azul would be back as square one after having those few days off.  However, instead of regressing in his training he actually progressed with out me!  When I asked him to ""Step up"" he did the cutest little hop and landed, both feet on my hand.  I was so excited that I had to remember not to jump or I might scare Azul.  It was such a moment to be held. After months of us hand-raising him and Azul getting some independence from us for a month I didn't realize how exciting and emotion filled getting over the first hurtle of training would be for me.  To hatch this gut go from being an egg to a bird who came on cue was such a joyous moment that I realized what this job was going to be like.  Leading up to this point, everyday was stressful and felt overbearing.  But getting to help these birds learn what is is to be a part of our program made me realize how much fun and fulfilling working with these babies can be.  Thank you Azul, because of you my outlook on work changed ever since today!",3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ820IQ0O,3U8YCDAGXQ236104KBT4GXQ820IQ0O,0.0

It was my 50th birthday and I was thankful that I was able to remember this time. Last year I had completely forgotten until my kids surprised me with a cake. Anyway, I got up and went straight to my routine. At this age, a routine is just what you have. Brushed my teeth, made some coffee, picked up the paper, made some breakfast. Wouldn't have it any other way. Well, I took a shower and wondered what I would do today. Nothing seemed appetizing so I just cleaned the house a bit. Around 5 oclock I heard the doorbell and it was my daughter asking to take me to dinner so I said sure, why not? She actually ended up taking me to her house and then I started to feel a little suspicious. She gave me the key and told me to head on in and that she was going to bring down some groceries she had gotten earlier. I said fine. I opened the door and I heard happy birthday screams all over the place and I felt my heart racing, in a good way. My family rushed over to hug me and say happy birthday. They threw me a surprise party when I thought I wouldn't have anything to do on this 50th birthday of mine.",,3UOUJI6MTE03VKDW4W2GZCA8D3XUX0,0.0

I hadn't seen him in over 30 years I was excited but worried, the only thing I was worried about is if we still would have the same chemistry we once did. At the end of the month we met up at a fast food restaurant. Once we met up again it was like old times and I realized that chemistry can't really die. It had been thirty years since we last talked but, it felt like we hadn't talked for a few days instead. We talked about old times, all the things we did in high school all the trouble we had gotten into when we were younger. We discussed old friends and old loves we had. We discussed our families and anyone we were still in contact with. I learned that he had married one of our old friends from high school and we actually made plans to have dinner at his house so that I can meet their kids and see his wife again. Its crazy to think his youngest kid of 4 children is a senior in high school. I feel like it was only a couple years ago that we were having house parties and running from the cops. Of course, that's years ago now at this point. I found out that he had a few dark years after high school, he told me the trouble he got into. He spent a few years in jail for burglary, but said those days are long behind him. We are both old now. We kind of realized simultaneously at the restaurant how two punk kids whose parents and teachers told them they were going to be nothing ended up having pretty nice lives. Also, it didn't matter anyway all the people who had their sour opinions about us are dead at this point anyway. We talked for a few more hours, before we realized that it had been a few hours. We made plans for another dinner, a week later. I can say that the chemistry hasn't faded, and to hold onto friends through thick and thin.",,3UNH76FOCTR9IHYX0QXWRG0N4A5YMB,0.0

I only had half knowledge of what that was and I felt as though I was burden with responsibility. So these past last six months my prayers was answered slowly but surely. The only thing i did was go to a store and ask a question. Not knowing the odds she would answer yes that she will help me. It may have taken weeks for a reply back form her. But when she called we didn't instantly connected the conversation was scattered at times. Then all of sudden she needed my help, that caused a door to be opened for me to gain guidance from her through couponing. She taught me how to shop and how to coupon within different stores. In my helping her she wasn't selfish in her giving and I was accomplishing more in saving then I even have. Also, the friendship we built was even better than ever. I was able get my head above water with her help and she gain a helpful friend. So i am thankful for God in so much ways that he answered my prayer just in time.",3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJMP1ZUH,,0.0

We waited for the longest time to get helped by someone. We eventually called our doctor and  he sent information down for us. We got our room and then the issues really started. She was in labor and despite everything, she wasn't progressing like she should have been. We were there 15 hours before the doctor said she was going to need a c-section. I fought against it and so did Susan. We wanted a natural birth! The doctor urged more and we ended up allowing it.

I asked my mother and father if it was okay that I move in to the family house for a couple of weeks since the wife and I were in the process of buying our first home. I thought everything would be okay but my mom failed to return an answer to me that same day, in fact she never answered me about the question as a matter of fact. After this they both started acting weird with me, not returning my calls and just being very distant with me, it was awkward and frankly, it hurt me. I finally had the nerve to ask them what was wrong and why they did not include me. They did not have an answer for me instead they behaved as if nothing happened, it was disheartening and made me lose all hope. I gave up and went a few days without even thinking about them when my sister messaged me, she said she had something important to tell me. I immediately messaged her back and we agreed to have some coffee that same evening. We met up that day and my sister said she had some big news to tell me, which I was surprised to hear, even more surprised when she told me the reason my parents were distant these past few weeks. She said that all this time they had been lying to me about not being angry and in reality they were very mad at me. The reason? Apparently they could not fathom that I did not baptize my child under their Catholic customs, which is something I was always vehement about not believing, but they did not want to see it nor care until now when it was my daughter's turn to be baptized, they felt it was my duty as a born Catholic. I was enraged and I vowed never to speak to them again. I haven't since then, they have yet to call me or even send me a text. This was very surprising to me and I never imagined to be in this predicament.",,3URFVVM1664S0FDB5EQ1WXQJES9ZUN,0.0

That day she walked to the front of the church with such a glowing smile I was proud I had her. As I took her head scuff of she smelled the stench of alcohol in my mouth she made a joke about it we giggled a bit before making our vows. The after party was the best and the memory will linger in my mind for the rest of my life. I will cherish that day, for the rest of my life. Since she reminds me how good that day was everyday. It makes me proud. She makes me proud. My dad made me proud for helping make the day a joy. My sisters and  my mother were the best. I love that day.",,3V0Z7YWSIZM27JZZLXRS58IVE0EV2M,0.0

He was always curious about everything. In the end his curiosity brought him to his death. My cat was always very bad about what he did. One day I could not find Miki anywhere. He always ran loose in the neighborhood so I never worried too much as he always came home. But this time a whole day had gone by. And no Miki to be found anywhere. I was very worried that he was lost.  So I started to look in the neighborhood. I put up picture posters of my cat everywhere in hopes someone would call me if they found Mike. But 3 days past and still nothing at all. I was sure he was gone forever and maybe passed away in the woods in the area. Cats often that get sick are known to go into the woods when they know they are to die. Some say it is because they do not want their owner to see them die. But I am not sure that is true or not. But then one day I get a call from a local neighbor who saw my poster. I was so hopeful the neighbor had found Mike okay. But the news was bad. Mike was curious as I noted and apparently he had jumped into a neighbors shed window somehow and could not get out. Due to the heat of the shed and the fact he could not get food or water to eat for day, he was found dead. It was a very sad day for me for sure.",,3V0Z7YWSIZM27JZZLXRS58IVDV4V21,0.0

She and her hubby and me and hubby met on Hilton Head Island, South Carolina. We spent a full and amazing week together! Despite the fact that it rained every single day, the four of us were so happy to be spending quality time together. We usually get together once a year, for the past 19 years, but recently illness has kept us from doing so. Therefore, this particular get-together was extra special! We were all healthy enough to enjoy the week. Sure, we all has a few more pills to take, as well as daily therapy-type exercises, than our previous get-togethers. But even through the aches and pains of aging, the week was fabulous. Some of the activities we did were: going to the beach, eating at local low-country restaurants (shrimp and grits... yeah!), attended a bon-fire at our villa, played bingo (woo-hoo... two of us won!), went ""house-hunting"" (looking at model homes is a favorite past-time whenever we get together), and especially just chit-chatting and catching up with life! One day was spent souvenir shopping for the grandkids. How fun was that? We helped each other choose really special gifts. (The 5 grandkids LOVED them all!)Even though it rained every single day, we had an awesome time. (The weather forecast was NOT accurate!) As always, this week was a special and memorable time that the four of us will not soon forget! I cannot wait till next year's get-together!",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MPWNNSL,0.0

We happened to be on the same boat for a Niagara Falls tour and she had forgotten to bring a poncho.  I was standing beside her when the mist started hitting us and she was shivering. I offered her my poncho and we started talking.  It turned out that we were both students at NYU.  She was a freshman with her eyes on law school and I was getting ready to graduate with a business degree and begin working towards my MBA. Back at school, our lives were busy, but we made time to see each other, even if it meant just sitting together to study in the library.  As we got to know each other, I realized that Emily was someone I wanted to be with forever.  After completing my master's, I was able to start saving for a ring.  Six weeks ago, exactly 3 years after we met, I suggested that we make a trip back to Niagara Falls. I placed the ring in the pocket of her yellow poncho.  When she put the poncho on, she pulled out the box and I got to one knee.  I was worried for a moment as she gazed at me without saying anything, a thoughtful look in her eyes.  She seemed to snap out of her trance and said yes.  Everyone on the boat clapped and we got many congratulations as we exited after the tour. I was still concerned about her hesitancy, though. I thought we were perfectly happy and I was confident she wanted to marry me. I asked her a few days later if everything was ok. I noticed that she would occasionally glance at the ring on her finger with a sort of sad look in her eyes.  She said that she was concerned about law school. She had applied to a few schools, some which were several hours drive away. She wanted to marry me, but was afraid that being so far apart for that long would be difficult and that our relationship might suffer.  She was torn between possibly pursuing a different career so that we could go ahead and marry or having to wait through three difficult years apart. Then yesterday, Emily got what she was hoping for -- what we were both hoping for -- her acceptance letter to NYU's law school! It was such a relief to know that we could be together while she completed her law degree.",,3UWN2HHPUZRI4D7ODLK7M91MRDOSNR,0.0

She lives around 3 hours away due to school so we always plan and get together when possible. For this trip we decided to check out the local Hibachi grill for dinner then go peruse the carnival that just so happened to be in town this weekend.  When she arrived, I couldn't help but give her the biggest bear hug since it had been so long since our last meet. We decided that we would try a new Hibachi place that had opened up in town for dinner. When we were seated, we got paired with a group of people who were celebrating a birthday. Everyone was jovial and incredibly friendly. Our grill chef was also such a pleasure. Everything was going great, he was flipping shrimp and making the flames almost lick the ceiling. We stared in awe as he balanced an egg on his cooking flat. Unfortunately he made a mistake while doing his flare. Poor guy ended up tossing an egg, and instead of catching it; it landed flat on his head and broke open. There was egg all over him!! It was hard not to laugh at this guy's misfortune but he took it like a champ. After a brief recess he was back at it to finish up our dinner. When our bellies were nice and full we headed off to the carnival. There were lights and rides and games everywhere. My friend even won me a giant teddy to keep as a memory of the night.

Neither one of us had a lot of money saved up, but we were determined to go on the trip together. We decided that we were going to stay in hostels with others to save some money. We also went to cheap museums to learn about the local culture of the areas we visited. I knew that I wanted to do more than just go to museums, so we looked up other free things to do. We decided to go to a local beach one day since it was the summer to swim in the water and sunbathe. We also found a couple free parks to hike where we saw some beautiful scenery and animals. The most important thing for me was tasting the local cuisine, so we ate out almost every meal. We found the best rated restaurants and eateries within our budget and went to a different place each time. We even spent a couple nights camping in the wilderness to save even more money during our trip. One of the last things we did was went to local shops to find local souvenirs to purchase. We didn't want to risk losing them throughout our travels or have it stolen, so we waited until the evening before we left. I bought a couple shirts, jewelry, and a keychain. My friend bought similar things as well, plus some extra things for her younger siblings back home. We both had a fun trip and didn't spent more than we had planned on. We both would like to take another similar trip together at some point in the future.",,3VD82FOHKRAKFHI4HEUKMTX9WMMCOG,0.0

I had recently gotten a significant promotion at work and we knew that with the economy being the way it was, it was as good a time as ever to make this move. Whenever we talked about our wishes for our future home, we always knew we wanted a view. There was some land being prepared for some new houses to be built on in our current neighborhood. The way it was set up, we knew that there would never be the ability to have new construction block the view of the lot we wanted to purchase, meaning we would always have the view we wanted. With the market being the way it is, our house sold quickly and we needed to move into temporary residence until the new home construction was completed. We chose to rent a duplex in our current neighborhood so that the kids school would not be affected. This was going to be an exciting adventure for them! We had secured all the loans and funding in addition to the money from the sale of our house to purchase the new home and were all set to get going on the build. There ended up being a very bad weather pattern that settled in our area for weeks. The land we wanted was on a pretty steep hill and as it turns out the water run off washed away a good part of the hill during this unusual weather pattern. We backed out of the deal and decided to keep looking for a different location to build. I had gone to work the next week and as it turns out my new position at work was offering me an opportunity to relocate with better pay! The new job was located in California, just 20 minutes away from Disneyland! We talked it over as a family and ultimately made the decision to start this new adventure over in a whole new place! We were all so excited!",,3VD82FOHKRAKFHI4HEUKMTX95HBOCG,0.0

So, instead o i just watched tv the whole flight. my husband of course was able to sleep the entire flight. This is very typical of him and he would sleep through a freight train going through. When we arrived we quickly went through immigration, but no one was there to meet us. we were very frustrated with my husbands's family for forgetting to pick us up after we made the big effort to fly there. after a phone call they apologized and said they were on their way, but we said forget it, we will get a cab. despite the rough start we had a nice week in spain visiting family and friends and then it was time to fly home. this was a day flight which was a lot harder than the flight over there. my youngest son napped for a little bit but he was very restless for the rest of the flight and i was exhausted. my husband was no help and he even fell asleep himself. my other son just watched tv so he was fine. when we arrived home finally, the two kids were jetlagged and woke up at 3am for the day, and i had to get up with them.

I work there every Summer at a music institute for 8 weeks.   Well at that same time my wife became ill. Not sure what was wrong with her but it may have been Lyme disease that she got from a tick bite while on a camping trip a few weeks before. So not only was she ill she was an ill mood. She started taking out her anger and dissatisfaction at being sick on me because she said I wasn't ""taking care of her."" Not sure what she wanted me to do but I was busy packing. Then at one point she flew into a rage and said I shouldn't come back after I finished my work in the mountains. I was taken aback by this but didn't say anything. I knew if I started arguing with her it would erupt into a huge argument. I couldn't do it. So I didn't say anything. I could not have my travel preparations interrupted. I was already afraid I was going to be late because I had started preparing later than I should have.   That was 2 1/2 months ago. I haven't  called her or spoken to her since that day nor has she called me. Although I'm sad about breaking up I feel it was time for that to happen. Too many un-resolvable problems in that relationship. Overall I'm happy, and I'm living on my own still in the mountains.",3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13SGK,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13SGK,0.0

My wife is ten years older than I and had been a child bride after being raised in a cult.  When she broke free doing so meant losing her children, and four of the five that she lost have come back into our lives after she had missed them for 17 years.  She was able, because of their return, to be there when her eldest child proposed to his girlfriend and began wedding planning.  She is excitedly buying things for the wedding but I know how much the hole in the timeline that their absence made will never quite fill.  I know that she will always miss the time that she missed with them and all the memories that she would have made over the years with them, but seeing her excitedly bustle and plan and be filled with joy as she plans to watch her son, her first baby, be happy is sometimes a bit overwhelming to me.  I am so happy for her and yet fell so badly for the pain she is still in.  It is admittedly strange watching the kids blend together, as she had one child with a subsequent partner and then later two with me.  Eight kids, and seven of them are regularly in our lives.  it is chaotic, and funny, and sweet, and scary.  Seeing the ways that the kids are all the same and yet so diverse is neat.  It is often strange realizing that my eldest stepson is only 8 years younger than I am.  It is shocking to others that we are already grandparents, though our son doesn't have contact with his daughter.  I wish that I could help them more, with their challenges in life.  I hope that I am doing enough to support my wife while our family makes these transitions.  I am certainly trying.",,3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPQ13GS8,0.0

As he approached he bumped against the table. I've noticed him bumping into things a lot lately but I thought he was just being clumsy. He has a bobtail so he's not as graceful as other cats I've seen... cats use their tails for balance. Anyway, I picked him up to comfort him and saw a bloody spot on his eye. It was kind of a dull brownish red, and I hadn't noticed it before. It wasn't a recent injury and it wasn't from hitting the table. I decided to see if it healed up or went away, and it didn't. Meanwhile, he kept on bumping into things. I decided it was probably time for a visit to the vet. I made the appointment, scooped him up into his carrier on the day of the appointment, and drove him out. He yowled the entire way because he hates going to the vet. We checked in and waited. After we got called back to the treatment area I explained my concerns. The tech weighed him, took his temperature, and looked into his eyes. A few minutes later the vet came in and we started talking. The vet peered into my kitty's eyes and quickly determined it was a tumor of some sort. ""These kinds of things happen sometimes as cats age, and usually there are a couple of choices. We can wait it out and see if it spreads, or we can go ahead and take the eye out. Keep in mind that if we let it spread there's a good chance your cat will go completely blind, but taking the eye out will cause a great seal of discomfort the rest of his life, and besides bumping into things, he doesn't seem to be hurting. So which would you like to do?""I decided to wait, and it looks like that was a wise choice. The cancer has not spread and my cat still wanders around bumping into things, but he is otherwise happy and in great condition for a half blind cat.",3VBEN272MLLCULQ2QH7CWPSPGD7SG2,,0.0

It was funny really, because at first we hated each other.  Always screaming at one another and almost getting physical on more than one occasion, Natasha and I somehow found a common ground on which to truly connect and bond.  Next, we fell in love.  I never would have thought that I could actually be someone who got lucky enough to meet my soul mate.  Boy was I wrong.  We had already gotten into numerous altercations at this point, nonetheless, it was a beautiful rainy day. That's right, rainy.  I love the rain and so does she.  We are antiheroes of sorts and so it was in the rain as the thunder boomed and the lightning lit up our faces on the back patio of our mutual friend Cole's Home buying anniversary celebration.  It felt as if time itself stopped and we entered into another dimension.  A realm of bliss and magic where all of our dreams and desires were fulfilled dancing in the pools of light that were our own pupils.  Since then, things have been, well, just exponentially better as time passes.  I certainly can see myself growing old with Natasha and I cannot wait to tell our grandchildren the tales of our beautiful journeys together.  I have to add in however, that it is vital not to just take for granted the people that we are brought together with.  It most likely is for a purpose and it can be easy to burn bridges beyond repair.",,3VELCLL3GL56M1VD2EMAI3549K81FY,0.0

Upon waking up on Tuesday I noticed that there were strange posts on her Facebook from other people, but nothing specific. I readied myself for work and made the 45 minute commute. As soon as I got in the office people were giving me weird looks and I knew something was up. I casually asked if she had called in already since her car was not in the lot. My boss, who is a very no nonsense man asked me to come into his office. I thought I was being fired or something. As soon as the door was shut behind me, he simply said xxx is dead, sorry. Those were his exact words. I thought he was kidding, and sat there in shock for several seconds before he asked me if I was ok. No I am not ok. I have to find out from you of all people, and how you tell me is simply she's dead, sorry? He would not let me leave work, so I called my husband to drive up and literally take me home.

The most memorable part about this birth was how difficult and dangerous it was for my wife and daughter. My wife struggled very hard to push our daughter out. This was surprising and concerning because this is her sixth child so she obviously knows what she's doing. On top of this, it turned out the umbilical cord was wrapped around our daughters neck. So as my wife struggled to push the cord would constrict around our babies neck and her heart rate would plummit. This made everything very complicated and stressful. As time went on they prepped the operating room for an emergency C-section and told my wife she only had a couple more tries at natural birth. My wife had an emergency C-section on her first child many years ago so even this solution was dangerous. There was no real easy way forwards but my wife was determined not to have another C-section. something finally gave way and our baby started moving. They used a suction cup on her head to help the process along. Once everything started moving they still had to get the baby out far enough to remove the umbilical cord from her neck. There was a tense couple of pushes and I just remember feeling worried for them both. At last they got the umbilical cord removed and everything went smoothly from there.  It all worked out in the end but the process of the birth was very uncertain and stressful.",3VJ40NV2QJ911YKF30PAB3XDIJGOTP,,0.0

When that sixteen-hour road trip includes torrential thunderstorms nearly the entire time it's even worse. To say the drive from Chicago to Connecticut was stressful is putting it mildly. When we pulled up to the beautiful, historical boarding school where my daughter would be living for the next few months we all knew it was worth it. The school was originally built in the late 1700s and the original buildings are just as beautiful and imposing as they were hundreds of years ago. Any residual trepidation I had about leaving my young daughter here slowly flew away with the light breeze in the enormous oaks in the quad. We got our room assignment and found my daughter's room. As we made our way up the three flights of stairs to unpack her, we realized immediately how tough a New England summer without air conditioning was going to be. She was so excited, she didn't even notice. We made our way into her new room and met her roommate and their family and thankfully it was a great match. After we got everything unpacked and set up, it was time to say goodbye. I've never left my kids before, especially so far away and for an extended period of time. I had been preparing for this moment for months. I told myself I had to be strong for her. As I leaned in to kiss her goodbye, and saw her admiring her new pointe shoes from the corner of her eye, I knew everything was going to be just fine. With a big wave and grin she yelled ""bye mommy!"" as I walked out the door, and I didn't shed a single tear.",3VHHR074H436XFKBD56HEQ11YHTL72,,0.0

I have not been home in nearly 8 years I have been living around the country trying new things and places out.  I came to Portland last month and have been looking for work and using MURK to supplement my income.  I am homeless and living in a shelter but it is still better then living in Las Vegas in a very black neighborhood.  I do have some issues with Portland, one of the big ones is the politics in the city is very liberal and very crybaby.  So as i look for a job and place the more I see the more I think I might change my mind.  I cannot live near liberals they are too weak and allow drug addicts and homeless to control their city.  I think I will look for something else.  I might even move to southern Oregon.  If Oregon is no longer my home so be it.  I might move to the middle of the country to a more conservative area or city.  I cannot do california because I want the immigrants out and they are swarming California.

Jackson then kept his distance from me and started displaying certain attitude towards me. He started keeping late nights as well and would always scold me when I confront him about it. All I felt at this time was that the whole word was covering up on me because my parents earlier told me that they never where comfortable with my relationship with Jackson. With this, I was devastated. Jackson then came to me one afternoon and said he was calling it off and that was all he wanted. I pleaded that we mend the Issues we had but all that was to no avail as Jackson said he was going to take responsibility of the baby and of course would grant me some benefits.       With this, I ended up wallowing in sorrow and poured all my frustration on alcohol .I spent almost all my days indoors drinking myself out forgetting the fact that I was pregnant and the alcohol could affect the baby. Jackson came by last week with a check in his hand and handed it over to me saying it was my benefit. The check read $50,000 and he said I should use that for my upkeep for the time.     That same day, I went to the bank with the check and on getting there, discovered that he scammed me. The check was fake and at that instant felt a  sharp pain in my tummy and suddenly everywhere went dark. I opened my eyes only to see myself on a hospital bed and few minutes later, discovered that I had a miscarriage just as the nurse was about to say. In all, It was so sad as I was scammed and had a miscarriage all in the same 24 hours. In all, this was a sad and still a sad memory to me.",,3VP0C6EFSHI7ZXORU7248PGU2HGM6Y,0.0

Several months ago, a 5-year-old patient came into the unit with some common symptoms - fever, chills, etc. but could not get a specific diagnoses. I was assigned to be the PCA working with this child during their stay. My main duties included parent and child education, what to expect, general bathing/cleaning/feeding, etc. One day, while I was alone in the room with my patient, he suddenly went into cardiac arrest. I immediately buzzed for assistance and began performing CPR. It was the first time in my career that I had done so, and although I had significant and extensive training, I had never performed CPR on a human being. As help arrived, I continued the CPR until the patient regained a normal rhythm. This event was one of the scariest moments of my life. In front of me was a 5-year-old boy whose parents were at work and had no idea that this was happening and his life was essentially in my hands at that moment. Although he survived and was eventually discharged, this event has stuck with me forever. Immediately after, I went to the bathroom and cried. I realized how physically and emotionally demanding and draining this job was. I never realized the lasting impact that a patient can have. Most come in for routine things - asthma, appendicitis, etc. and have a short stay that leads to a happy and healthy discharge. This incident changed my entire mindset on my career and will last with me forever.",,3VSOLARPKCVTVUIFMW01W0YQU8A39D,0.0

We were drinking a few beers and having a good time.  I don't know which of the players from the Cubs hit a home run, but when they did, we jumped up in excitement. I lost hold of my beer in the excitement, and it flew and hit the back of this lady sitting in front of me.  It was almost a full beer, and all of it went on her shirt.  She was furious, and I was mortified.  She started screaming at me, and at first I was apologetic.  When she continued to scream at me, I told her to ""Fuck off, I already apologized.  What the fuck else do you want me to do?""  At this point, the guy she was with started getting loud and threatening.  My brother-in-law started jawing back with the guy as well.  Then security started to approach, while we were going back and forth.  When security got there, I explained that it was an accident, and that I was not being drunk or disorderly.  They diffused the situation, and we were able to continue and watch the game.  There were no further disturbances.

It completely broke my heart because I never knew how hard it was going to be not being able to save one of them.  I had picked her up from the shelter along with a mother cat and two kittens.  Those babies did fine and got adopted pretty quickly.  I had renamed the kitten Minnow because she was just so impossibly tiny.  Her mother had been apparently a feral female cat and they had just managed to trap Minnow instead of both.  At the time she was probably all of five weeks.  She seemed healthy when I brought her home and was eating fine but a few weeks later she started losing weight rapidly and going downhill fast.  We tried electrolytes and she perked up for a bit and I had her eating this super high calorie after surgery food they give animals for recovery.  She seemed to be doing well but then I walked in one morning and she was having seizures in her pen.  I called my rescue leader to come help and B took her home to do an IV but it was too late.  We later discovered she had a liver defect and she just wasn't able to get the proteins and fats she needed to survive. It was a terrible situation and my heart still hurts.  I have used this as a learning experience though so going forward I know what to do when these things happen.  I have a little willow doll specifically for her and for the other foster babies I may lose in the future.,3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ042QH91,,0.0

The love they have grown for each other and to be apart of this wedding and to be apart of a memorable day is amazing. They just go married May 12, 2019 the most gracious and amazing part was to hear their vows. The vows was so heart filled because to be close to them and to see the man her husband has molded into and grown into to be for his family. It just gives you so much happiness. The reception was also amazing her mother passed when we were kids so to see the happiness and memorials for her felt like she was there. We had such a great time we danced all night. The food was amazing and the decorations was just so beautiful her day was fit for a queen. The even better memory is they are expecting their 2nd child which is a soon.

He brought some stuff with because we were going to have a picnic in the middle of the day and rest after hiking. We got the picnic set up and I sat down to eat. I noticed that he did seem a little different than usual. I thought he was just super excited to be in Yosemite. He told me that he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. I was very thrilled to hear that. We then spoke about where and how we would like our wedding to be. We have plans to get married in Las Vegas in the near future.

Eloping into the mountains seemed perfect because we love Colorado and it's natural scenery has holds a special place in our hearts. I told three of my close friends about our plans, and asked two of them to be our witness to our 'ceremony.

To celebrate my birthday and to for general relaxation I decided to take a vacation. I went to Saint Lucia for 10 days and 9 nights. This in and of itself is not out of the ordinary or remarkable, as I have done something to commemorate the date of my birth every year since I was born.  What was notable about this particular vacation was that it was the first time that I travel with a sex worker as a companion. I was a bit apprehensive about the idea at first. I did not want to a bad experience with someone who has a disagreeable personality. I am experienced in dealing with sex workers, but only on a short term basis i.e. a matter of hours. Also, I spent some time living in Saint Lucia during my childhood. This vacation was going to be nostalgic and had sentimental value to me and I did not want to spoil that. After much deliberation I decided to travel with a beautiful provider I have been working with for nearly two years now.  She has been quite lovely and professional through out the time that I have had the pleasure of working with her.  One of the things I enjoyed about her was that she was comfortable sharing the same bungalo at the resort. We made time to spend together and also had separate engagements. I even visited the town of Black Bay where I lived as a child.",3W8CV64QJ3L8P2PE1HP30UZ0EF39H6,,0.0

My previous career was going no where and I was stuck in a rut. That's when I saw a commercial for real estate agents. I felt like my mind was open. Why work for someone else when I can be my own boss? I called the number and got all the info. I went to the classes and learned all the tricks of the trade. I got my license and became an official agent. It's a big change for me. I have more freedom now but I also have more risk. I can work all day and night and not get paid for it if I don't make a sale. I'm so nervous because I can easily lose money doing this. I feel like it's worth it though. I finally have the pressure I need to push me far in life. I feel like this is the first step towards real success.,,3WAKVUDHUX29G575MJYI5DXKMSK7UV,0.0

We both thought we'd have some fun gambling our money away instead of getting drunk at a bar.  So, we get to the casino and find some slot machines to put some money in.  We spent a few hours just letting the machines eat our coins up.  We weren't winning anything at all.  After that, we got some food at the restaurant inside the casino and decided we would continue with the slots.  There has to be a winner sometime soon, right?  No sooner than I put my first coin in, I realized I had won!  And not just a small chunk of change, either.  I won $10,000!  As you can imagine, I did get a lot of jokes about the luck of the Irish being with me all night long, even though I'm not Irish.

My search took me to Mammoth Cave National Park.  I booked a hotel and got tickets to the cave that day.  The whole family was extremely excited to go!  While we were on vacation there, the kids could not stop talking about how happy they would be going inside a cave.  It got me excited seeing things through their eyes.  When we got in the cave, they were a little freaked out at first, but got used to it.  They were amazed that we were actually underground!  They learned so much about caves and how things look underground.  We had a great tour guide who told us all about the history of the cave.  It was very interesting for the adults as well.  Being inside a cave is a weird experience, but we all had so much fun.  We would highly recommend to go to a cave for a vacation.

He and his friend were out drinking and came back late one night. Though we had already broken up at the time, Steve was still living at my house while he looked for a new place. It certainly made for an uncomfortable living situation. So apparently Steve lost his key and ended up pounding on the door and smashing the doorbell over and over. It startled me awake to say the least. When I opened the door I was shocked to find a bloody mess. Steve's friend was holding his hands over his face, as blood poured out onto the ground. They were hysterical and didn't even answer me at first about what the heck had happened. Evidently they had gotten into a fight in the parking lot over something trivial and my ex punched him in the face. What a good friend! It was clearly a broken nose that needed to be re-set, which was a bit above my pay grade as a trainee nurse. The house was absolutely covered in blood though, especially the bathroom where Steve's friend immediately went after coming inside. Knowing that I had to get up early for work, I had no choice but to clean all the dried blood up before I laid down to finish my now disjointed sleep. I felt terrible that next day at work, and don't think I am out of line to blame it squarely on my ex and his poor actions.

Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women. I was felt some pain in the armpits or breast that does not change with the monthly cycle. Also pitting or redness of the skin of the breast, similar to the surface of an orange. A rash around or on one of the nipples and discharge from a nipple, possibly containing blood. So I confirmed that I was diagnosed with breast cancer. The doctor will check the breasts for lumps and other symptoms. Several tests can help detect breast cancer as Mammogram, Ultrasound, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The main treatment are radiation therapy, chemotherapy, surgery, biological therapy, or targeted drug therapy, hormone therapy. But  I had chemo, surgery and radiation as treatment. If surgery is necessary, the type will depend on both the diagnosis and individual preference. A lumpectomy can help prevent the spread of the cancer. This may be an option if the tumor is small and easy to separate from its surrounding tissue.  A simple mastectomy involves removing the lobules, ducts, fatty tissue, nipple, areola, and some skin. In some types, a surgeon will also remove the lymph nodes and muscle in the chest wall. A person may undergo radiation therapy around a month after surgery. Radiation involves targeting the tumor with controlled doses of radiation that kill any remaining cancer cells. A doctor may prescribe cytotoxic chemotherapy drugs to kill cancer cells if there is a high risk of recurrence or spread. When a person has chemotherapy after surgery, doctors call it adjuvant chemotherapy. Sometimes, a doctor may choose to administer chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor and make its removal easier. Doctors call this neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The entire process was very exhausting and emotional draining.",,3WI0P0II62EXHMGY926Z0UKWR9KDRR,0.0

We went to San Diego, California. It was my daughter's first plane ride and only my son's 2nd plane ride. We were nervous about the vacation because we didn't know how our children would do flying together. Our daughter gets scared of a lot of things so we didn't know how she would handle being on the plane. We ended up having an amazing time, though. We booked to stay at the same hotel my wife and I stayed at for our honeymoon. It is right near the water in San Diego, has an amazing view, and has a tremendous pool there with water slides. Our kids loved it and we even stayed in the same tower of the hotel that my wife and I were in when we went on our honeymoon. We ended up going to Sea World as the first big stop on our vacation. We spent, literally, the entire day there. We got there right when it opened up and we didn't end up leaving until it was about to close. One of the cool things about what we did there is we got this food pass. With this pass, you can eat a meal at up to like 8 different restaurants, every hour! We certainly got our fill of food and it was also a nice way to take breaks from walking and going all the time to just sit, eat and let the kids relax before going to the next show or the next activity. We also spent a lot of time during the trip at Belmont Park. It's got carnival rides, carnival games, all sorts of shops and great food. We really had a good time there. Our last stop on the trip was to the San Diego Wild Animal Park. You get to ride a tram around the park and see various animals from Africa and Asia. A really cool experience! The kids loved seeing those kinds of animals up close and not just in some cage. All in all, we had an amazing time and the kids were great. It showed us that we could take our kids on fun adventures like that and that we really didn't have anything big to worry about.",3WJ1OXY92B2T1AYQQJ9XJCHLFP28AW,,0.0

I was running with him in the front yard and he suddenly dropped. His breathing was labored for a few moments and I was foolishly thinking he would catch his breath. He didn't. After a few seconds of not breathing I tried and tried to get him to start again. I did compressions on his side and even tried mouth to mouth and no matter how hard I tried nothing would work. I scooped him up in my arms and ran him to the vet as fast as I could but they were closed. I walked home carrying him, tears streaming down my face hoping for a miracle. One never came. I knew he was old. I'd had him since I was a kid. But I still just was not ready. My mom says that he lived a good life. I know that he was happy. He would meet me at the door every time I got off the school bus. He would eat my scraps at dinner when mom wasn't looking. He'd lay on my feet as I slept, keeping me warm. And now I have to figure out how to live without those things. I know it's not like I lost a parent or sibling, but it hurts because I was responsible for him. It hurts that he died running and exhausted when he should have died just laying down in his bed or something. I just hope that he knew how much he was loved. I buried him in the back yard with his favorite chew toys. My dad went and got a beautiful wooden plaque made for his headstone. I thought that was beautiful. I just hope he knows how loved he was and how much I'll miss him.",,3WMOAN2SRCJYW5OS7GPCXWLTGTVNVI,0.0

Yet  it was still a significant day. It was truly bitter-sweet. While all of us were overwhelmed that she would be able to stay with us forever her parents also had to verbally give up their rights to the sweet girl which was painful for us all to hear. Even though it was best for all involved. After we had all signed on the dotted line the judge came and gave us all hugs. She said this is a new beginning even though it was painful and rough to get to this point. She gave my niece a teddy bear. So  she could always remember this day and how it was an important day for all of us. She had a new family that promised to take care of her and love her and keep her safe.

This marks the third ceremony that I have attended in the past two years. The first was my oldest son's White Coat, and the second was my wife's ""Pinning"" ceremony for completing nursing school. My family has accomplished a lot in the past two years!! The White Coat Ceremony is somewhat of the induction into the Pharmacy School. I was very happy about this recent event because it meant my son, who at times struggled with school in general, made it in on his first attempt. The struggle was constant for him, but he worked hard and was very persistent through his journey. The whole family attended, my two other sons and my wife, plus grandparents, and uncles and aunts. The Ceremony was short but sweet. I kept thinking the whole time how happy I was that both of my Son's are on the path to a great and successful career. This lead to me thinking back to my journey with my education and career, its a journey that I did not want my sons to go through. I was married with kids at the age of 20, and it seemed like my life story had already been written. I was fortunate to find good work without a degree, and eventually I finished college in 2015. My son's are on a more stable track and I am so grateful to my wife who pushed them along in their journey. I never imagined that as such a young father, that my kids would already accomplish what I could never had dreamed.

I could not believe what was happening at the moment, I got frustasted even though all the things that the doctor was explaining to me made sense and actually explained why I was feeling like that but it is not easy to accept this kind of news right away, it is just a hard pill to swallow. However I found certain strenght in me, I asked the doctor: ""what is the next step?"". He promptly answered me he will referred me to a specialist which he will guide in the following steps, that I should not lost any hope because my cancer was at the early stages so my chances were high to survive it. I immediatly went to the specialist's office and he examined me and he started talking about my case, he was making sure that I fully understood everything he was telling during our first consultation because it was key to start the treatment process. Then he gave me the steps to follow, what kind of diet should I have, what medicine will I be taking from now on and how regularly should I be coming to follow my case. The final outcome of this initial phase was preparing me to surgery because my situation was hopeful given the early detection. I followed the instructions given me to letter by letter because in my mind I was sure that I would not give up on living and being with my family. Weeks were passing by and I was starting to feel better, even though, I had to admit when I started taking the medication it was kind of hard getting used to this meds because they are really strong nothing like the usual stuff you would be taking for a cold. The last follow-up with the specialist was decisive, he gave priority and we set up the date for the surgery. I got home and it suddenly realized how big that day would be, it would mark a difference in my life. The date was getting closer and the anxiety was getting higher however I would not give up. The date came and the surgery was performed, everything went great. After a few days the specialist did a scan where there was not hints of cancer and I finally recover my opportunity to keep fighting in life.",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1RX7C8BG,0.0

I couldn't wind down, I couldn't relax, I couldn't stop thinking about my day that day, and everyday forward, showing back up to that same old place. I decided to head outside, pop my headphones in, and take a stroll. As I walked along, I tried to focus on my breathing. In, and out it went, slowly synchronizing with my steps and the harmony of the music in my ears. In and out, with every exhale I left more and more of the workday behind. Forgetting the stress, the ungrateful clients and thankless work, and the dull boredom pounding at the back of my head. I'm not sure how much time passed by... maybe minutes or hours. All I can say, without a doubt, is a few laps around the block later I felt relatively at ease. Yes, I had to go back the next day and do it all again. However, at least for the moment I didn't have to worry about that. I could return home, kick my feet up, and focus on myself for the moment. Maybe I'll crack open a beer and catch up on some reading, or just chat with my friends. Who knows, it doesn't matter. Let's take it day by day.",,3WOKGM4L7220LPNO5Y10RSV8MWT0OC,0.0

He was a very active and fun person that was getting ready to retire in the next year from work. He was a very active golfer and loved to fish. He had many groups of friends and was very active for being 65 years old. A group of us would go on a guy’s vacation trip twice a year to the mountains and to the ocean. We would rent a place, play golf, water ski, shoot guns and play some poker. We did this tradition for the last 8 years. We had such great fun with our group that was from the ages of 30 to 70 years. It was sad to see him develop cancer. He went downhill very quickly. The cancer was very aggressive and he made it about 4 months before he passed due to complications. He was a military veteran and we had a wonderful celebration of life starting at the military cemetery. The funeral was sad but wonderful to reflect on all the stories about Steve’s life and how he carried himself. We proceeded after his ceremony to his favorite sports bar to celebrate his memory. It was fun to catch up with some of the other people in his groups of friends and family that I did not know. It was great to hear about his youth and many of the fun stories and events that occurred in Steve’s life. It was very healing for me to be able to share. A sad but warm feeling around Steve’s friend and family.",3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJI7WB10,,0.0

This story begins like any other -- I started the day by waking up, showering, having a small breakfast and then preparing to leave for work. On most days, I ride to work with my coworker since he lives very close by and doesn't mind driving me. That day was no different. I hopped in my coworker's (we'll refer to him as 'D' from now on) car and said 'good morning'. D greeted me, we put our seat belts on and then headed for work. Everything seemed to be going as it normally did - D and I shared some small-talk on the way to work. We ended up stopping at a coffee-shop drive through to help us wake up a little more.   After leaving the coffee shop, our normal routine was disrupted by something rather shocking and unexpected: While we were at a stoplight, we witnessed a vehicle run a red light and hit a pedestrian who was crossing the road with his car! D and I were both shocked and felt helpless. I immediately dialed 911 to report an emergency, as I was worried for the pedestrian's life. To my surprise, after explaining the incident, the 911 operator put me on hold! I couldn't believe that an emergency this severe was being put on the back burner -- I was a little peeved. However, around 3 minutes later, the operator came back on the phone and assured me that emergency services were on their way. I was relieved, but still worried about the pedestrian who had been stuck by the car.   At this point, D and I decided to get out of the car and make sure the pedestrian was alright. The pedestrian was in disarray, but stable and not in critical danger -- he just had a few scrapes and bruises.    Around 4 minutes later, the ambulance arrived. We stayed with the pedestrian until the ambulance assured us that he was alright and taken care of.    D and I rode to work just like normally afterwards - but we had to explain to our boss why we were late!",,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1R8XMB8K,0.0

What I find memorable is when I went down to Sea World for a recent trip. The trip was well over due and was infact a weekend vacation. I drove down from my town in Central California but first I needed to buy a GPS. I found one on sale online for about 100 bucks, a Garmin type. I proceeded to wait for it and update and install it in my vehicle. My vehicle also needed some maintenance like an oil change and tire check up. I was ready to roll, it was at this moment I realized I could've probably used my cell phone with google maps to direct me but you can't be certain because it doesn't work without cellular data on continually. I went to the local dollar store and stocked up on snacks and drinks; the usual water, gummies, some twix, and some chips. I then loaded up my playlist which is a mix of various genres and hit the free way. The driving was so soothing and chill, the California weather was spectacular. I was well on my way; 3 hours later I stopped in a Subway for some lunch. I then continued on my journey. I stopped again later for some gas; bathroom; and restock on snacks. Later that evening I finally reached San Diego but it was very late; I needed a place to rest because the events would be happening the following day on Saturday. I went to my brothers house and crashed with him; he didn't know I was coming because I wanted to surprised him. I ended up meeting him and he decided to go with me to Sea World so he could show me around the place, its huge. I ended up having something take alot of pictures for me while I posed by the different animals. The place was very stunning; my favorite part was the Killer Whale exhibit where you go watch them do tricks with their trainers. I wouldn't feel comfortable being so close to something with the world ""killer"" in its name, seems dangerous but the trainers weren't harmed. I ended up grabbing lunch later with my brother at some Mexican taco shop in Sea World that had massive burritos that put Chipotle to shame. It seemed like time flew and it was already evening. That was my recent trip; I won't bore you with the details about returning.",,3WQ3B2KGE92G9KJXXC0EZDEJUTHB15,0.0

As I said, that was about three months ago. Jake had seemed kind of fishy, smiling a lot during the previous two weeks.  When Friday came, he showed up at my apartment and told me that I needed to pack enough comfortable clothes for three days!  Considering he typically doesn't even stay the night, this made me very nervous!  He refused to tell me where we were going, but told me I needed jeans and shoes for walking outside. So I nervously packed up and we got into his car.  He wanted to put a blindfold on me, but I refused, because it would make me car sick. I agreed not to pay attention to where we were going.   Turns out, he had rented us a cabin right on the lake, about 90 minutes out of town.  It was so beautiful!  It was quiet and peaceful.  The first thing he wanted to do was go swimming in the lake.  I didn't bring a swimsuit!  Well, he didn't either, and turns out he had wanted us to go skinny dipping.  It was awesome, but I was so embarrassed because I had never let Jake see me naked in full daylight where he could see all of me.  It was also very....  inspiring, so you can only guess what happened after the swimming.. I'll never tell!!Anyway, it started getting late and Jake wanted me to cook dinner.  Well, guess what?  There is no stove or microwave in this place.  Just a big fire pit in the back.  I have never cooked on a fire before!    He said he learned how in boy scouts and that he would show me, and he did!  It was the best weekend, so peaceful and beautiful and I feel so much closer to Jake now.",,3WRFBPLXRBAEKWM9N6J6E1TA9T0N37,0.0

The weight on my shoulders have been lifted, and I can sigh in relive.  It was only a month ago that my surgery took place to remove testicular cancer. This feeling of dread from the scan to see if the cancer had spread has been a awful time. My high fear and stress took over, leaving me worried about the smallest thing. Though my doctors have been a help, I was so nervous to weight for the result. However, that moment haring the words that I'm healthy was one of the best feelings in my life. It makes me feel as if I was given a second chance. The surgery scar is healing and I feel semi normal again.  This whole experience has been life altering, but it's time to get back on track. Though there will still be medical checkups to ensure that the cancer never returns, I feel good and hopeful. My goal is to start being more healthy all the way around. Mentally I am glad to learn how to calm my anxiety. Phonically I'm in good shape, but will work to keep it that way. I'm excited to see what happens next.",3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1RX7C8BG,3WQQ9FUS6BGYKK3IWX9TEN1RX7C8BG,0.0

In Michigan I went to a winery with my girlfriend, aunt, uncle, mom, and sister and we talked about growing up and got nostalgic.  The next day was my cousin's wedding.  I remember him as a baby so it was strange to see him getting married.  He is all grown up now.  Everyone laughed and drank and had fun.  I got to talk to all my aunts and uncles.  One uncle I had not seen in 10 years so it was nice to catch up.  He has been going through a rough patch.  Seeing everyone made me remember how much I loved them all.  I wished we lived closer.

It was something I knew I would eventually do, but did not think that I would need for a while longer. I hated going home to a house that was empty of the wonderful greeting that a dog gives you. I have always wanted a Brussels Griffon, it is a hard breed to find. I love the idea of adopting, it is what I have always done, but with research I realized that would not be an option for this breed. It took about a month of searching but through hard work and good luck I was connected with a Breeder that lives 2 hours north of me.  She had a litter of puppies that would not be ready yet and a 5 month old that she wanted to keep for herself. She is a breeder that also shows her dogs and he was her pick of the litter. He had a medical issue that prevented her from showing him, she would have kept him but thought I would make a good home. I have no desire to show a dog, I just wanted to bring a treasured family member into the home. I got my new baby when he was 5 months old, he is the happiest, sweetest little boy and he makes me so happy. He reminds me of my dog that I lost while being his own personality, he keeps me busy. I am distracted from the loss of Ginny by all of the attention that a new puppy demands. There is potty training, going to obedience classes and taking him on more frequent walks, I haven’t been this busy in a while. I never forget Ginny, my little girl who passed, but he fills the void she left and makes the house alive again. It was love at first sight for me and he has one of the best natural dispositions of any dog I have ever had, he is such a joy.",3WR9XG3T64XAZ7DQ7D70S9ZQEL747J,,0.0

If you remember, she's the one I met in Miami 5 months ago. She was such an amazig girl. She was very pretty, and very smart, too. We had so much in common, and the things that we didn't have in common only made me more curious about her. I can't wait to see her again. We have kept in touch. She lives about 75 miles away from me, but that doesn't matter. When you have something good, you make it work, right? Anyway, she is supposed to come see me in two weeks. I am trying to plan what we should do for the time she's here. She'll be here for a 4 day weekend, so I want to makre sure we have a lot of fun. I am going to take her to dinner, but I want to cook for her too. I was thinking about taking her to a concert, or maybe to a wine tasting festival?

I realized among the clouds why people think heaven is above earth, in the sky. Clouds form mountains and the space between clouds become lakes of sky. It is sublime. After thinking this, I realized how high up I was. My chest went tight and I repeated curses in my head. The pressure from the ascend made my panic worse. I managed to calm down by loosing my bra and distracting myself with a movie. The panic returned so I stared straight ahead and tried to ignore the pressure that the descending plane gave. As we descended, I couldn't help but glance out the window again. The world again looked picturesque. The way the buildings peeked out between evergreens made it look like a model city you see in movies. It was amazing and I nearly forgot my fear of heights until the pressure increased.

She has always been a fighter though and did not give up easily. She still had a life to live and wanted to spend time with family and friends. It was sad to know that her time with us could be measured but we rallied and spent as much time together as possible. She fought the predictions and never accepted the doctors estimate. She went to every treatment and tried some experimental things and surprisingly went past six months. She ended up holding on for nearly two years but in the end the fight was lost. At the end she was in so much pain that she was ready to go. She knew that we had come to terms with her upcoming death. We had shown her that we were ready for life without her. She finally gave up the fight peacefully and knew she did not need to fight anymore. It still hurts to know she is gone but we had extra time and I value that to this day. She was always a fighter through my whole life. Her refusal to give up has inspired me and her entire family. It was a lesson to never give in to your circumstances and to keep trying to love and live.,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK,,0.0

It was very hard to say goodbye but at least we had time to spend together the last few years as the cancer was not sudden and was caught early enough to treat and extend her life. My mom fought a hard fight and did not let cancer take her easily. In fact she was fighting to the very end and never let cancer define her life. I was able to be with her throughout this journey and am grateful that she was able to spend her last few years with me and my family. My daughter will always remember her grandma as a fighter and someone who never gave up.  Every time the doctors told us the end was near my mom fought through and bought herself another few months. It got to the point though that the pain was obviously wearing her down both mentally and physically and myself and my wife had to let her know it was ok to let go. That was probably the hardest part of the whole thing, telling my own mother that it was ok to stop fighting so she could be at peace. We knew that if she thought we were not ready to let go that she would keep fighting until she had nothing left. She came home from the hospital for her last few weeks and we will always cherish that time we spent as a family together. Now that she is gone I am still sad and miss her greatly but am glad that she is at peace and free of pain. She taught my daughter what it means to fight and to not give up regardless of the odds. She also taught us how to let go and say goodbye. Her funeral was not a sad affair as we gathered all of her family and friends and had a party to remember who she was as a person and what she truly meant to us all.",3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK,3WS1NTTKEZY6FCAV6VIA4YMUSEW0FK,0.0

But I felt like I already knew. I had been worried about Karen for a long time. He said that they had needed to do an autopsy and that they had been waiting out the results for quite some time. He said the family had said that, but they were pretty sure it was drugs. An accidental overdose. I really do wish she had reached out. I was surprised when she was fired, and when I heard that she kept having trouble with her son's father. I hope her son is okay but I feel like I know he won't be. How will his father explain that? How will grow up with this knowledge inside him, that something ate away at his mother so terribly that she decided to leave his life. I don't know.

I feel like I could call her now and she would pick up, but the realization hits me that that can no longer happen. Waves of sadness, grief, and despair come over me. I remember the last time I spoke with her. It was a strange encounter, at the store, as we usually meet at each other's homes. That was the first, and last, time, I'd ever ran into her. She seemed to have a light shining behind her, and I distinctly remember that when I looked at her, it was like no one else was around. She seemed so healthy, so happy. What had gone wrong? Why couldn't I have helped her? I just didn't know anything was wrong inside of her. Her passing showed me that I need to reach out more to others and help them if I feel like I should. I need to ask how they're doing more often or just offer to come see them and be more friendly. When I think back on our long conversations, I never remember her seeming like she needed more. I realized after her death that sometimes you have to just offer more, even if the person doesn't ask for it, because you never know just how much they need.",,3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAYIHCBP,0.0

Even though we are both adult, we felt like kids again for the first time in a long time. I guess it would be more like I felt like the kid this time. To see the Disney castle as we approached the park was something magical. Who ever thought that an adult as old as I am could smile so wide just seeing their favorite Disney characters. It was so much more than I ever could have expected, or imagined. Since it was an all day venture, we started by having breakfast. We ate pancakes while watching old Mickey Mouse videos on a large monitor. We laughed and laughed. Walt Disney's vision was defiantly revolutionary in bring happiness to not just kids, but adults alike. After a couple tours around our favorite parts of the theme park, namely the Lion King and Aladdin, when got some lunch. While eating lunch we watched Goofy bring smiles to the faces of many kids. Then we headed off to the Star Wars areas, because my son is a huge fan. We visited a movie theater, and watched Mulan. After that we watched the live showing of the theater play The Lion King. That was my favorite. It was getting late so we went to get dinner before we left. My son choose a cafe themed after Star Wars of course. The food was excellent, whatever it was called, haha. We got so many pictures that I will always cherish. This was a day that I truly got to be a kid again. Thank you.",,3WT783CTPC30WNTVD9PYG9XAPNABCI,0.0

In fact, I just started back after a two week break from school. Now, I'm starting the Hematology part of the program. Anyway, on the point of Microbiology, I did learn a lot about the subject. It kind of turns out that it is, more or less, just a desk job. Albeit, a very stinky desk job. The workers come in, have a stack of work in front of them for the day, and pretty much just work on that at their desk. Because of this, it is kind of my least favorite part of the lab. The other departments involve quite a bit more moving around and multitasking. I have worked plenty of desk jobs in the past, and don't have much desire to continue to do so any more. I'd rather have a job that's a little more fast paced and active. Luckily, it looks like the profession that I'm choosing has a little bit of both. I wouldn't want to stay too active all the time, either. Having a good balance will make for a better experience. I think I'm going to dig it.",3X08E93BHW45AU3Z7RVNJTJ863G66P,,0.0

I am enrolled in a Medical Lab Tech program at a college. I have already finished the core class requirements for the program, and am now engaging in clinical rotations. These rotations take place at local hospitals. I essentially go in, as if I am a regular employee, and learn how to do the job with other working employees. Unfortunately, there is no pay for this, but the idea is that the experience will pay for itself. Once of the classes I had to take was Microbiology. The class itself was tough, and a little confusing. It was essentially a long list of organisms, and the media that is used to grow the organisms. So, a lot of memorization. Now, and for the past six weeks or so, I have been doing my clinical rotation in the Microbiology department. The surprising thing that I have found is that the job itself isn't nearly as confusing as the class led me to believe that it would be. Granted, there is a massive amount of knowledge that is required to be known, but there are tons of reference materials at hand, and the use of them is heavily encouraged. The job is basically a desk job. I did not expect that. The employees in the Microbiology department work at one of six stations. The stations determine the type of work that will be performed for that day. The work that they will be doing for the day is laid out in front of them at the beginning of the shift, and once it is completed, they are basically finished working for the day, and just do extra things until the shift ends. So, this experience has opened my eyes to what working in this department would really be like.",3X08E93BHW45AU3Z7RVNJTJ863G66P,3X08E93BHW45AU3Z7RVNJTJ863G66P,0.0

The party was for one of her school friend's that I had never met. Her name is Ashley, and she is really into Disney Princesses. The invitation said that the guests were encouraged to dress as their favorite princess. My daughter has never really been into princesses, but she does enjoy the Disney movies. She selected to dress up as Jasmine from Aladdin because she liked the outfit.  When we got to the party, there were a bunch of girls dressed as princesses playing princess themed yard games. My daughter said hello to the birthday girl and joined in the games. I walked over to the group of parents standing by the refreshment area to introduce myself. The birthday girl's mom, whose name is Sheila, welcomed me and told me that cake would be soon because it was a special surprise cake. About 30 minutes later, Sheila called everyone to come gather around the refreshment area. When everyone was gathered and silently waiting, Sheila yelled, ""Okay, cake, come on out!"" Out walked the most beautiful Princess Belle that I had ever seen. She was gorgeous, and wearing the most stunning yellow dress, just like in the movie. Sheila walked up to her with a knife and stabbed the dress while everyone gasped in horror. Sheila and Belle looked at each other and laughed, the dress was the cake! I had never seen anything like it, not even on the cake making shows on television. It was mind blowing. Belle stood still while Sheila cut everyone a piece of the dress cake. I doubted that it would taste very good, thinking that there must be a trade off for the amazing appearance of the cake. I was wrong, the cake was delicious, probably the best I have ever tasted.",,3WZ36BJEV42HI4V6ZVKO5JXEAQMTBQ,0.0

My grandmother used to tutor my grandfather in school. When he first saw her,  he thought she was the most beautiful girl he'd ever seen. ""She had long dark hair and was carrying her books in her arms as she walked down main street."" Not long after their tutoring sessions ended, they began a courtship and quickly fell in love.  It was the 1930's and they were young and poor. My grandfather couldn't afford to purchase a wedding ring for my grandmother. She didn't much care about a ring but my grandfather desired to give her one. Many years later,  my grandfather opened a jewelry store in a Fitzgerald, Georgia. On their fifteenth wedding anniversary my grandfather drove my grandmother to his store and had her pick out a wedding set. She chose a modest round cut diamond solitaire and a matching diamond fishtail band. She was very fond of the rings and would only wear them on special occasions that required formal attire. My grandparents have been gone for a couple of decades now but I often think of how determined my grandfather was in getting the rings. He only had an 8th grade education but in his lifetime he owned a Standard Oil filling station, a jewelry store, and was a brakeman for the railroad. Last year on my birthday my mother came over to bring me a card and a gift.  She handed me a little velvet box that had my Grandfather's jewelry store name embossed on it.   I shed some tears as I opened the box to see my grandmother's rings.  They were more beautiful than I remembered.  I was so deeply touched that my mother wanted me to have them.

Recently, however, her health has been failing and she is in and out of the hospital every few weeks for one thing or another. She is very weak and needs constant attention and help. My uncle and his family are living with her to help take care of her and give her the attention she needs. As a child, I would spend at least one week of every summer break staying at her house to visit and we both always looked forward to it. So, in early June I decided to do that again, thinking it may be my last chance to do spend that much time with my Grandmother and to also help give my uncle and his family a bit of a break from taking care of her. The day before I was to travel, I was given the news that my Grandmother was again in the hospital with pneumonia and that she wasn't ""like herself."" I decided to visit anyway. When I got there, it was late, but I made my way into her room and she was asleep so I sat in a chair that was in the corner and slept until morning. In the morning, I said, ""Hey! Grandma!""But while her eyes were open and she pivoted them towards me, they were distant. She mumbled something when I hugged her which I took to be recognition that she knew who I was and was glad to see me. Over the course of the next few days, she was very weak and completely out of it. But then, suddenly, she started to regain her faculties and started to be able to talk and think more clearly like how I had remembered her. On the last day I was there, she was so strong and cogent that in a totally impromptu moment during a conversation about how she should write a poem about her situation to help cope, she made up an entire poem in her head. She wasn't strong enough to write, so she had me transcribe it and it was amazing. She had returned to how I remembered her in mind and spirit and we were able to really have a nice last day together before I had left. She's had issues since then however and I don't think she's been as good as that day and so I'm pretty protective and thankful for that moment/day I got to share with her.",3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBS08LX,3X3OR7WPZ0MAXTPUNAYNSQXWBS08LX,0.0

I had been putting it off for awhile, but I finally decided to bite the bullet and just drop out of college. For the last year I've felt bogged down with anxiety and it's getting worse and worse. I didn't want to let anyone down or waste my efforts so far and so I tried really hard to push through it. Unfortunately, it's just been too hard lately and I couldn't take it anymore. I actually literally left in the middle of a class because I was feeling so overwhelmed. At that point I was just done. I made an appointment with my counselor later that afternoon, and I let them know I wanted to drop out. I feel so stupid, though, because I have all of this debt now and it's for no reason! It doesn't seem fair that I didn't finish but still have to pay in full. I will try to look into it and see if I have any options, but I feel totally hopeless. It's a joke, to me, that our system works like this. Right now I just feel like such a failure, I want to curl up and do nothing. I hope I can start to feel better soon. This is really making me think that it's time to get in to see a doctor about this anxiety, because it is ruining my life.",,3X4MXAO0BHAWQSGPQXBPSI9HQQ3WRQ,0.0

Traveling alone is something she never did, and thought she would ask me if I would go with her. I took some some time away from work and we booked the trip to go to Columbia. I was so excited because I love traveling, and being able to go to a place where you can emerge in another culture is exciting to me. We arrived in Columbia and couldn't wait to start exploring the culture and sites that we wanted to see. The first stop was definitely a place to sit and eat so we can take it all in. As waiting for our food to arrive I couldn't help but not to just want to stare at everything and everyone. It is amazing to see them do what they do everyday. There was so much stuff we wanted to see and do and be part of. After eating we came across a younger lady who spoke a little english. We asked her if she could help us by guiding us around. We first stopped at a market there well we shopped for clothing and home made apparel. It was amazing to see that these women put these materials together and created beautiful pieces. After leaving the market there was some events taking place nearby. The event was traveling as a single woman abroad. I was a little hesitant at first but knew I wanted to take advantage of every opportunity I had. So it was a train ride threw this historic place where you really got to see how the people in Columbia lived. It was something I'm glad that I did and took part of. After a long day we both went back to our rooms, where the next day we flew back home. The most amazing event was talking to local Colombians in Spanish. Learning and using Spanish was also the most challenging task for me during my journey.",,3X65QVEQI19C9WF74MESUCTFAEQLCK,0.0

The whole process has been life-changing. I feel like I've grown so much as a person because of this. Her sister isn't able to have babies so we weren't sure if it was hereditary at first. So Immediately when we found out, we were both really happy. We had bounced names off of each other all week for a boy or a girl. I think at the time we decided either Luca or Atlas if it was a boy. If it was a girl we were both set on rory, since we used to binge gilmore girls. A few months later and we finally were at the doctor. This was going to be the big gender reveal. Our child was being stubborn in his mom and wouldn't turn over but eventually we discovered what we were going to have. We're having a boy.

I haven't been to a zoo in years and it honestly was not my first choice of places to go.  But it was our niece Skylars birthday so we pretty much had no choice. I have to say the zoo is nothing like I remembered it to be. It has changed so much from when I was there as a kid dozens of years ago. First of all the layout is so cool. There are different rooms and exhibits to visit all over the place. The monkey and reptile rooms were interesting but my favorite animals were the cheetahs. When you see them on TV you don't realize how big they are in person. I was surprised at how enormous their paws are! They were so friendly and personable they reminded me of my cats at home. I know the cheetahs could rip you to shreds in a second but it was cool to get so close but still be safe - ha ha. Watching them play reminded me of giant kittens. The zoo visit turned out better than I thought it would. And I may have to go back to check on the cheetahs. I hope they add more to this exhibit in the future.",,3XC1O3LBOT8TVDHIQ89IJMTJYZQTL9,0.0

She has been with Sean for about five years, though they definitely had their hard times. Things started out so well before they began to have a lot of disagreements around Sean's alcohol consumption. Around two years in it became absolutely unbearable for Sharon and she had to do something about it. After a large argument and much intervention, she ultimately told Sean that she needs to leave him if he did not quit drinking. She did not want to leave him but she was under the belief that this was the only thing that could get Sean to go back to his former self that she fell in love with. Initially, Sean took this terribly and told her if she really did not love him that she should just go then. She, reluctantly, left. Two days later Sean called her from a rehab center, saying that upon further reflection he knew Sharon was right and he decided to check himself in to rehab. Sharon agreed to support him through this and they stayed together while Sean learned to handle his problems. After about six months Sean got out of rehab and their relationship began to blossom again. It was exactly like it was when things started out and Sean and Sharon were the perfect couple together again. About a year ago now, Sean proposed to Sharon and seeing that he was a changed, true, and whole man again, Sharon agreed excitedly. After a lot of planning, they settled on the perfect wedding for them - a small wedding in a small venue with only close friends and family. It was truly the proudest moment of my life. It was wonderful to watch my sweet daughter get married to the man of her dreams and it was also clear to me that Sean's intentions were true and honest. A story that started out blissfully, turned into much pain, finally had a happy ending and I could not have been happier about all of it. It was a true joy and an absolutely wonderful event. They are still so happy together and I could not be happier Sean never looked back to the bottle.",,3X73LLYYQ20TE4T82R88IVUKSY5HNV,0.0

I was sweeping the club house and fetching drinks as the members held their meeting in the other room.  At one point my fellow prospects and myself were sent outside.  While outside we did some work on the fence and otherwise just hung out and talked.  I got to know a couple of the prospects from that chapter as well and we got along great.  Then at one point myself and another prospect were called in front of the members.  We were grilled with questions like asking how many days we had and what we learned in that time.  At one point another member came up behind me and pulled my prospect cut off me.  I struggled a bit but he eventually got it off me and asked if I wanted it back.  If I did I would have to go through him.  My heart was racing and I was about to do it too, but then I heard the snap of a can opening.  As I turned around I saw several brothers walking up to me with open cans and proceeded to dump them on my and my other brothers head.  The feeling was cold but still felt so good knowing what it meant.  I felt a great sense of accomplishment and pride knowing my hard work has paid off.  I was then handed a set of patches to put on my cut and I went to work.  We had a few beers and then had to get back on the road.

We always laugh and joke with each other when we get a chance like that. Plus the cake was delicious!",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV9ZARQW,,0.0

I spent an entire week cleaning the backyard and building  an area where her and her friends could relax . The theme was a movie night along with sleeping outside. I had build an L-shaped couch with air mattresses for them to sit. A table full of snacks, candies, and soda where all set. The tent was up , with even a fridge added inside. We allowed the girls to purchase two movies to watch , whatever they wanted.  This was of course after the pizza , cake and presents were done. Then they headed outside. I can recall just hearing them laugh and being typical teenage girls. I wont ever forget that night since i was exhausted from preparing everything . But especially since the girls never went to bed! My bedroom was right near the tent so i heard them all night. I specifically recall them at 6 am saying there was donuts inside. As they ran to the front door i jumped out of bed and ran as well . Since a stampede of teenage girls were about to raid my kitchen. Overall , the girls ate there donuts and one by one went home. It was a success and i made it throught the whole ordeal . But its definitely one i will remember. the giggling of teenage girls all night and the hard work i put forth in doing it was all worth it in the end.",3XCC1ODXDMXR6VK3EOCJ0TRV0GKQRU,,0.0

A routine of getting up to watch the roof eat and go back to bed, my self-esteem and consciousness were fragile at that time. With that situation for a person so active in social or sports activities, it was a very strong blow to my lifestyle. My mother at that time offered to serve me in the church, I was not very comfortable with the idea but I had no argument to deny her so I decided to give it a try and enter the production area to learn to put together event lights. From there I began to meet great people who have been every blessing in my life. From that moment on every Sunday I attended to learn faster in my service area, I talked with everyone in the church to meet them in addition to spending my free time simply enjoying the free coffee service. All the activities that the church was attending without hesitation since it wanted to see in its entirety as the community towards its goals and objectives with these activities. as once we went to a hospital after a sharing among all church servers to give our patients time to chronic diseases. Seeing their reactions and their stories was pleasant and makes a difference in your way of thinking towards the world and towards yourself. In addition, the church moved to a new terrain towards which I have been able to witness its growth from 0 to date. which gives me a very strong sense of belonging to the community. In addition to building stronger ties with people and living unique experiences with them while we build a place for those who seek help and peace. To date I am really happy and comfortable and able to solve the problems that life presents. There is still much to solve but I no longer feel anxiety if I don't get excited to see the result of my future actions. No more to add until the next story in the newspaper.",,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22R3TEPQ,0.0

He has only had one other owner his whole life so I know his background and training. He has no hidden ghosts in his closet, unlike Bourbon. His name was Tucker but he is being renamed to Butter because he really does look like a stick of butter. My daughter loves him and thinks that he is just the best thing ever. She has now renamed several of her toy horses after him. I am ecstatic that I found him and that he is going to work out perfect for us.

I didn't know how I would ever be able to ride him.  I knew I should have got a horse that was a bit more easy to ride, but I knew he was the one I wanted.  I took him home to let him settle in to the new stable.  After a day or so, I put the bridle on him.  I used a step stool to put the saddle on his back.  Now the challenge came as to how I would get on the horse to ride him.  I led him over to the wooden fence.  I climbed on the fence and hopped on.

I was sitting on the couch with my husband, and I got a phone call about our previous foster children, Mark and Sarah. Their mother was arrested for breaking and entering. When I heard this news, my heart dropped. All we ever wanted was the best for them. I truly thought they were in good hands! Their mother really seemed to be going on the right track... I thought there was no way she would go back to her previous lifestyle. Then I thought, ""will I have to go back to MY previous lifestyle now?"" These children need to be taken care of, and it's clear that their mother can't do that anymore. But my husband and I weren't prepared for that task. It had been three years since we took care of those kids. We are used to our lives. Things are quiet. We have more freedom and flexibility. I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a pain to take care of those kids. Of course, we loved them like they were our own, but they were quite the handful. The most shocking part of the situation, however, was my husband's response. He was supportive (for once). He said he wouldn't mind if I took on less hours at work if I wanted to take the kids back. I knew I married him for a reason. We may not agree on everything, but the man has a big heart. We haven't heard any more  news about those poor kids or their mother. For now, our life will remain quiet and comfortable. But it's nice to know that my husband is supportive of welcoming Mark and Sarah back.",,3XM0HYN6NLLHXFEJS5DU1H22049PES,0.0

I rem this day like it was yesterday. The most memorable day of my life was becoming a father. It was on June 23rd of 2019,I got off from work and decided to surprise my wife. I bought her some flowers and a very beautiful dress because i wanted to take her out for dinner. I was so excited to get home and see my wife after a long day at work. At this point my wife was 9 months pregnant and she was almost delivering but we knew she had like one week left before the baby comes. When i got home i found her sleeping on the couch watching a movie,i told her i had a surprise for her en i asked a to go and freshen up cause i wanted to take her out. After the shower she tried the dress on and it looked perfect on her. As we were busy telling each other how good we looked that evening,she said she felt a sharp pain in her tummy,she ignored it,then came the pain again for the second time,she started screaming asking me to help her. that's when i knew it was time for my prince to come out,she looked so beautiful in that dress,honestly i got a little confused by that situation cause i didn't know what to do first. I remembered the scenes in the movies where a man took the car keys first,that's exactly what i did,i helped her down the stairs and we headed to the hospital. As i was driving my heart and mind were racing,i so nervous,we got to the hospital and the doctors took her  to a private ward,the doctor asked me to relax that my wife was gonna be okay,i tried but i couldn't relax at all,i was anxious and nervous at the same time. I had to call my mom and sister to come and be with us at the hospital,my mum was so excited about the news,my heart kept pounding but again i couldn't help the excitement of becoming a father,i was so happy because this was gonna be my first child. After few minutes my mom and sister arrived,then the doctors came out smiling,when i saw the smiles it calm me down and i knew all was well,they told me its a boy and he was normal and healthy,believe me nothing can measure the joy and pride i felt that day,i jumped up and down hugging my mum and sister,i remember i even cried,they were tears of joy. I couldn't wait to hold my little man,my mini me,we were allowed to go in and see my wife and kid,when she saw me she started smiling and she said,""you are a father now,i love you"",i couldn't believe holding a baby that belongs to me for the first time,we had waited for so long before my wife could get pregnant but on 23rd of June 2019 she gave me a son. I will never forget this day even if i get old,this is a very special day to me,the day i became a father. I am so happy to be a father and i thank God for my son.",,3Y4W8Q93L06PATXFIMB91R9ZMFUVD9,0.0

My fiance and I had just been on a long hike. At the end, he got down on his knee in the mud. When he asked me to marry him, we were surrounded by swans. The mud was the most memorable part. I couldn't believe he was willing to kneel in the mud and ruin his jeans for me! Sharing the news with my mother and family members was also quite memorable. This event was significant to me because we have been together for 3 years exactly. It happened on our 3 year anniversary. We are waiting 2 more years to save up enough money for the wedding, but knowing it will eventually happen fills me with indescribable joy and happiness. Our parents have also been pressuring us to get married, so it was nice to see how happy they were to hear the wonderful news as well. I can't wait to marry him. I can't wait to spend the rest of my life with him! Just talking about it again makes me elated. I am now in the wedding planning process.",3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYP075HT,3XUHV3NRVLKPOFN2YRCMOEUYP075HT,0.0

It was very exciting and seemed like it was never going to happen. We began moving in and had to learn about caring for the home. This opened a new chapter for us and the start of home ownership. It is a lot to learn and a lot of care. But, it is worth it! We went through some discouraging times before we found the home that was meant for us.

I was finally able to marry the girl of my dreams, something that for a long time I didn't know was possible. We haven't officially gotten married yet, but being engaged allowed to take things to the next level. We bought a house that was simply beautiful and was pretty similar to what I wanted to have growing up. It was hard to believe that things were falling into place for me. While the house was great and the person I got to spend my life with was greater, something was still missing. We weren't really about kids, but we wanted to care for something. I had wanted a dog for a long time, and she was a dog lover herself. The breed was debated here and there, but we ultimately settled on a Maltese puppy. I believe we made the right decision. The pup has taken well to the household and we think that was what was needed to complete the home. I honestly just look forward to my future unfold before me. Again, hard to believe someone like me could be blessed with something so wonderful. And this was just five months ago. And we're only getting started.",,3XXU1SWE8NHBJLTNVFWIQXB3NRKA0W,0.0

It has been awhile since we have connected and spent time together. Honestly it maybe past three months already since I saw them and life really does fly past by us and we just don't necessarily notice that. Anyways, Paul, my father in law always cooks this mean and delicious lasagna everytime I come over. He does this because he knows it is my favorite food to eat a lot everytime I come over, now Janet, on the other hand, my mother in law, sets up the games we play for the night. The games usually is a combination of board games and mostly mind games, I remember that night it was a little bit of Jenga for a casual warm up game, and the main game for the night was charades. I don't usually drink but I am pretty sure that night I drank around 3 bottle of beers, I didn't feel drunk at all even though I was driving. I was incredibly happy that night because I remember winning a lot of the charades game. I definitely missed them because we don't usually meet up anymore and spend quality time quite often like before. I ate just a little bit of lasagna though even though it was still consistently good. It is a good thing that I didn't ate a lot because I drank more than I ate. When I was about to leave for the night, I really felt happy and enjoyed the night. I won a lot of games and it's been awhile since I drank alcohol. Nights like that always makes me wonder if only people try to spend quality time with the people close to them, it is not that hard. Hopefully I get to spend some more time with my in laws in the coming months, I truly did miss them a lot.",,3XXU1SWE8NHBJLTNVFWIQXB3N4DA0F,0.0

I was arrested for it last year however got away with a slap on the wrist and a small fine. Sense I make such good money at it, it's usually well worth the risks. Well, after last night I'm reconsidering this profession. I got a referral from one of my regulars. Referrals go pretty well most of the time. I kind of know what to expect from the person who's referring them. When I arrive at the hotel room everything seemed normal so we immediately handled our financial business. He then went into bathroom and asked me to put on a blindfold. I was a little reluctant however, since it was a referral I did it anyway. Several minutes later he comes out of the bathroom takes me by the hand and opens the adjoining door to the room next door. He takes off my blindfold and I see that the entire room is filled with at least a thousand pieces of fresh fruit. I looked over at him, and to my utter shock, he's wearing nothing but an adult size baby diaper! Not to get into too much detail but he wanted me to do unspeakable things to him with the fruit. I had to think about it for a second but like I said, the money is good and besides no one was getting hurt. About 30 minutes go by then all of a sudden, there's was a very loud knocking at the door. Since he's in the diaper, I go to answer the door. To my surprise, it was the police saying that someone had called in a domestic disturbance happening in our room. Then without hesitation, my client blurts out ""She's a prostitute and she made me do it."" So guess what? I get taken to jail and he's left to try and explain the ""situation"" to the police.",,3XXU1SWE8NHBJLTNVFWIQXB3XE70AT,0.0

I'm still amazed at what happened two weeks ago, and have to tell you about it! You know how I did that DNA test a while ago? Well I got the results back, and there was actually a cousin I never knew I had who lived just a mile away in our little senior community! From what I understand, she's a cousin on my father's side, the daughter of his sister. I guess there was some bad blood between her and her parents when she was young, and so she ran away. I'm not sure if my crazy aunt (she really is a piece of work) ever tried to look for her or filed a missing person's report or anything, but this missing cousin ended up right near me after all these years! It took me a few days, Diary, to get up the courage to try to contact her. Finally, I looked her up on the internet and found a number for her. I dialed, said who I was and what the DNA test had revealed, and, surprisingly, she was so thrilled to hear from me! We made a date for coffee at the little shop that's part of our community. When I walked in, I could spot her right away. I could see the family resemblance right away! We must have talked for three hours! Turns out after she left, she got in with a bad crowd, but turned her life around after she got pregnant. She raised her kid the best she could (he turned out great and such a handsome young man!) and worked her way up to head buyer for her company. What's even more amazing is that she's a horror movie fan, just like me! I'm looking forward to hanging out with her more, and to meeting her son as well. Gotta go, Diary. So much work to do, but I wanted to share this with you! Millie",,3Y5140Z9DY2TDKG5OO3LMW0UJWEPIO,0.0

The fireworks were cool, though. On the way back to the train station, I felt like I needed to talk about the anxiety that I had been having lately. After listening to my experiences, she asked if I was okay, and talked about what she does to handle her anxiety. I was worried about having a panic attack on the train that night, so she drove me home instead, even though that was kind of expensive for her. She sent me a guide to some of her methods for helping with anxiety through text later. I felt so comforted by knowing that she dealt with that, too.

He chases squirrels up redwoods, and seagulls on the beach. We've only ever fed him organic, grass fed beef in the morning, and grain free, organic chicken based kibble at night. He's never been overweight and always been up for anything. Two weeks ago, he suddenly just fell on the ground, unconscious. I totally panicked. I've never experienced anything so shocking or out of the normal flow of events in my adult life. We took him to the animal hospital immediately, where they kept him overnight. We had blood tests and a full evaluation. It's great that we have pet insurance or we would have been out $2,000! Billy is on medication now, and we have to give it to him twice a day every day to help him stabilize. It's so sad to see something you trust to always be here start to decompose and degrade.

This is something we haven't done since the second child was born. It took some planning as we currently do not reside near any family member. My mom agreed to fly over and watch the boys while we took the trip. We had to make sure that our trip coincided with mom's calendar as to when she could get a vacation from work. We decided on Las Vegas as we heard of all the live shows and it seemed like something we would be interested in. The day of the trip came and my mom was here and all settled in with the boys. While I was very nervous leaving them for an extended period, I had all confidence in my mom who already raised 7 kids herself. Getting to Las Vegas and seeing all the street performers, the many sights and the crowds was exciting and overwhelming at the same time. The live show we saw was magical.  The acrobatic movements of the cast daring and scary but  was a sight to behold. Dressing up in anything but leggings and t shirt was also a welcome change. It was simply amazing. The most memorable part of this event was being able to reconnect in a special way with my husband. Having the chance to focus only on each other helped us to remember why we fell in love . I would definitely like to make this an annual event where we get away just the two of us.",,3Y9N9SS8LZX5YKVWYC53IWHGVPND34,0.0

When it finally loaded I had and email from Disney about my upcoming trip to Disney World. I got really excited because it referenced Galaxies Edge, the new star wars themed land opening up soon. I was already prepared to be waiting in line forever, but little did I know this email was about to change all of that. The email was making me aware that Disney was going to accept reservations for all of the attractions in Galaxies Edge, but that the reservations were already open! I rushed to the closest computer I could find and I called my wife. We both logged on and the webpage kept crashing constantly. I just kept reloading the page and my wife did the same over and over until we finally got put in line. Adrenaline was pumping, and she got the reservation for us to do the droid building, and I got the reservation to go into Olga's Cantina to drink the blue and green milk. I am so excited I can barely contain myself, I am a huge fan of star wars and it defined my childhood. It is also working out amazingly that Galaxies edge opening day is on my 5 year wedding anniversary. My wife doesn't care for star wars as much as I do, but she will enjoy it because I like it so much. It will make my wedding anniversary that much better, and I get to walk around saying ""Babe, I am your husband"" in my best Darth Vader voice. And we will have a wedding anniversary drink of the blue milk, and a droid that we built together. I wish we got into the light saber building but the reservations were full and I did not want to spend 200 dollars not knowing if it would be worth it or not.",,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLMLL487,0.0

My boss walked into my office like he typically does and it's usually to chat about work related stuff as well as to chat in general about how things are going. This time, he started off chatting about normal, routine work stuff and then casually threw in that my promotion was finally approved and about to go into effect. He's been pushing for my promotion for over a year and a half at that point and I had almost given up all hope of this happening any time soon. Evidently, the higher up managers approved the promotion as well as Human Resources. A salary was also approved and my manager informed me of what that new, higher salary would be. I felt relieved that this finally happened and I could stop wondering about my upcoming promotion. At the same time, once my supervisor told me the percentage raise I would receive, I was slightly disappointed. The percentage of my increase equaled the usual annual salary increase I received the past couple of years, even without a promotion. I was unsure if this signified that my past annual increases were abnormally high or if my promotion salary increase was abnormally low. I was hoping for a much bigger raise. Ultimately, my supervisor informed me that there is a cap on how high of an increase an employee can receive in any given year and hopefully there will be more of a raise coming up after my annual review in a couple of months. Given that we had just had my annual review, performance reviews, and all that, I was hopeful that perhaps, even with my recent promotion, I would still qualify for a significant raise when the fiscal year was over. I didn't tell my supervisor about my disappointment with the percentage increase because he was so happy that he was able to get my promotion pushed through after all this time. I didn't want to deflate him or make him feel that his efforts were unappreciated.",3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,3YDGXNSEO0GEZLI9HIZ669VLESN84J,0.0

There were many candles on the cake, because they looked good on the type of cake that I had bought. We lit the candles, and soon the candles erupted into a large flame. The flames had joined each other into sort of a bonfire like appearance. It was funny but somewhat dangerous. My family member had to blow them out quickly before the whole cake burned up! My family enjoyed the party.",3YGXWBAF713GBO8MYUFB8VR4C2L4C8,,0.0

This was right before the school year began and my rent was increased. I have been trying to save to move but I don't want to waste money on another apartment. I would rather save up for a house. I felt confused and felt like I was running out of time. With me having 2 children, I can't just up and leave because I don't have a lot of money to buy food, clothes, housing deposit, plus moving expenses. I felt overwhelmed by the situation. When it first happened, I was planning the summer break for my children. We were not able to take them to the beach since this happened. We didn't know whether or not we would have to pay extra utility bills along with the new property owners and increase in rent. I have started to save but it has not been easy. The first day of school was yesterday and I had to buy new clothes, shoes, and school supplies for my daughter. My son will be starting school next year which will make it even harder. Also, my car battery died a few days ago which needed to be replaced. I feel like I'm running out of money and trapped.

I joined because I wanted to get into better shape. It was also very close to where I live. He was there the third time I went. I don't think I'd seen him since I moved out 10 years ago, and hadn't thought about where him or anyone else moved to. I just kind of forgot. We talked and actually seemed to get along well. He looked pretty happy and wanted to know if I was new to the gym. I told him that I was. After that, we talked for a while. I'm surprised that he was so nice since my memories of them aren't the best. Mom never had anything good to say about them after I left. The family didn't get along well. As far as I know most of them moved out of the area. Definitely strange to bump into someone I didn't expect to see, but I'm happy I did and happy that he seems to be doing well. It definitely doesn't feel good when you meet people from your past and things go poorly.",,3YDTZAI2WY2WOLYOIXQRRZ8D8FF14K,0.0

I am now in charge of my group's decision making.  We all get along well, so this is a group effort.  Once in awhile we have a little disagreement, but usually thinks go quite smoothly.

I always stay with her about a week each summer with my 3 children. She lives there with my uncle and her two children. We look forward to it every year. It is a special visit always. But this year was extra special. My granny, who lives right now the road, is very sick with an incurable disease. She very likely will not be here on earth for our next visit next summer. So I made a point to visit her and spend extra time with her. When I arrived I was take aback because she was much sicker than she was the last time I saw her.  I sat and talked with her, helped her around the house, and ran errands for her. I visited her on numerous days this visit. Last year, her husband, my grandpa, died. So I know how important it is to spend time with her because it may be limited. As a matter of fact, my grandpa died one week after my visit last year and I was so grateful that I made a point to spend time with him. During my visit with my granny I had deep conversations with my her. She told me details about her life that I did not know,  and gave my advice about my own life. I will cherish that forever. I also spent a lot of time with my various family members, cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. We had a blast as always. We sat by the pool and sunbathed. We went to softball games. We went to a skating rink and out to eat. We played with puppies. Overall, the visit was perfect, and made even better with time spent with my granny.",3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUO6RJP0,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFUO6RJP0,0.0

Since we both have pretty hectic lives, we had input our destination some time ago.  As usual we hit traffic on the way to our destination.  So after 30 minutes of backtracking, side streets and getting on and off the highways we finally arrived.  Or so we thought.  We quickly parked, hit the lobby bathroom and went down the street to the location.  When we got inside the reception was going full swing.  I noticed it was kind of odd that I didn't recognize anyone there.  Like literally anyone.  We found some empty seats and surveyed the room.  I remember whispering, ""um, I think somethings wrong.""  A little while after that a elderly gentleman sat down with us and starting telling us a story of the bride and groom when they were young.  And the groom had a different name than my uncle.  Apparently the venue had a conflict with scheduling and the reception had been moved to a different location.  Which we were not aware of.

I had worked at an elementary school previously as a teacher assistant but needed to find something full-time that would pay better. I loved the school but I had no way to progress there. From the first day of starting my new job at the call center I knew this was going to be very difficult for me. Why? Well, I hate talking on the phone and that is all I would be doing at this job. My first day of training was really intense and overwhelming. I was the only person being trained and had two trainers assigned to me. They drilled me on banking and loan material over and over until my brain was numb. I went home feeling awful and uncertain of what I had gotten myself into. Why did I take this job? Why did I take the first position offered to me? I was filled with regret, fear and anxiety. I never wanted to go back. But the next morning I was there at 8 am, ready to be drilled again. I endured the first week of training but my mental health quickly declined and I couldn't picture myself doing this job. I just couldn't. The following week I switched back and forth with the idea of quitting or sticking it out. Finally, I knew what choice I needed to make. On the last day of my two week training I showed up and told my trainer and supervisor that I needed to quit. I was so scared and sick to my stomach but the moment I confronted them, I felt a weight being lifted. I decided I would give my following decision the following Monday, gave it more thought and ultimately decided to quit. I felt awful for giving up but doing so was one of the best decisions I could have made for myself and my well-being. I was nervous about finding new work but to my surprise, I landed a new job less than two weeks later and found a much better fit. This experience was stressful and tumultuous but ended up leading me to something much better.",,3YJ6NA41JC2P8V0B66OLYXFU55APJ4,0.0

First, I made sure that the groom made it to the ceremony. He had some alcohol beforehand and started to get emotional. I made sure that he stayed under control. Then, after the ceremony, I made sure to get everyone drinks and snacks while they got their pictures taken. The bridal dance was a mess initially because nobody knew what they were doing. I made sure that it went well and that everyone kept dancing. At the end of the night, I helped load the cars. Basically, I made sure that the wedding went off without a hitch. These originally were my wife’s friends so she was very appreciative. As a result, she definitely was looking to reward me. So, we ended up having some amazing sex at the end of the night.

He works for a great rate but doesn't communicate and sometimes has take over a month to do a job.  So this was one of those times. I went out of state for 3 weeks and dropped it off, assuming that he could do the job while I was gone and I wouldn't be waiting when I got back.  It all was very efficient.  Well, I got back to town and guess what? The job still wasn't done.  I was told it would be done the next day.  Nope.  The next week. Nope.  Then I just wasn't told anything. So while this is going on, another friend who knows how these mechanics can be had a Subaru sitting in his driveway that he didn't want anymore.  It was in a bit of rough shape and certainly understandable why it was being given away, but the interior was nice and more importantly it drives like a dream.  I couldn't believe how cool this was because the friend I speak of, who gave me the car, was barely a friend at this point. We had maybe hung out 2 or 3 times.  It was just completely unexpected and came at a great time.  I was able to sell my Jeep to someone who really needed it and the car has treated me well for the most part.

I was drawing a huge blank! I didn't really have it in me to write a long tale about anything, but I also didn't feel inspired to write a short story. I thought about writing in the fashion of Bukowski, but I recalled how our professor stated to never write like someone else. We were to write how we'd want to be heard. When I decided to just write and see what came out, it came out disjointed. Nothing really made much sense regardless and it was a flowing sea of words that were choppy like waves. Soon, I realize that maybe I was thinking about this all wrong. I thought how writing like Bukowski is different than writing in the style of him. His style is very unique and I really love how he tells stories. Maybe his style is a little disjointed, much like my writing in the class was becoming. At the end of the class, we all turned into the professor our work. The next day, I was called to the front to read my story and was used as an example of how to write in the style of someone and not copying them. I was flattered that my work was recognized! It was even more flattering when I knew that  my paper was probably just a disjointing thought process written to paper.",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943671CYU1T,0.0

The shooting in my hometown happened two weeks ago, but it still feels like yesterday. Everything has been like a blur since that day. My phone has been in a constant state of activity with so many friends from other states reaching out to see how I am. Everyone wants to know if I knew any of the victims. The crazy thing is that I truly didn't know how to answer them. I was waiting for plenty of responses from other friends who live nearby, so it was very stressful. You never really expect this type of thing to happen to you in your own backyard, so it has understandably rocked us all to the core. The vibe around town has also changed quite a bit. People seem more cut off, more distant towards others. For so many people to lose their life because of senseless violence is just a complete tragedy. And to make matters worse the shooter was known to many people and a lifelong resident. My younger brother went to school with him and even shared some classes. Though he moved away after graduating high school, he still has vivid memories of the shooter back before he showed violent tendencies.

I found your website, and finally I have the confidence to take the plunge and take my daughter out of school and educate her at home, thank you, thank you. I cannot get over how much great information and super ideas you have here. Fantastic! This is simply fabulous!! I just now found this site and I'm so excited!! The opportunities and suggestions as well as the need to inspire are exactly what I have been searching to fulfill!! I'm so thrilled to get started and even more excited to continue to explore all of the fabulous suggestions and creative ideas you have offered here!!! When I was about 13 I had a huge crush on Aaron Carter. When he and Hilary Duff started dating I wrote in my diary, 'How am I ever going to get over him?! It hurts to know he has a girlfriend! My heart hurts. I feel like I’m dying! What am I going to do? No one will ever be able to fill this void in my heart. wrote a list of people’s names at the back and what they should change them to should this diary ever be published. I had written in my diary after a fight with my mom, and was very angry with her, saying things like 'I hate Mom, she’s so unfair'. My sister found the diary later and showed it to her. My mom wasn’t mad, she knew I was just venting my anger, but she punished my sister for invading my privacy. Best mom ever.""When I was in sixth grade, I was in an online relationship with a guy over IM. He lived in Britain, was a year older than me, and called me pretty, so I fell head over heels for him. Some of my entries about him included 'What is it, really? Love and longing? Or a passé.' When things took a turn for the worse (he proudly declared he made out with his neighbour in front of his mother) I wrote inspirational quotes I read in magazines, my favourite of which is, 'Pick your head up, princess, your tiara is falling. He was never faithfu'",,3YW4XOSQKR7V5JS3X3H943671CYU1T,0.0

My girlfriend and I had been dating for about 8 years and decided it was time to take a nice vacation for just the two of us.  After discussing it for a while I found out she had never been to a beach, so we decided to head to Miami.  She was so excited and everything was perfect, however there was another reason I wanted to take this vacation.  I decided that she was the love of my life and it was high time that I went ahead and asked her to marry me. So I found the perfect beach in Miami for us and decided this would be where I popped the question.  After the flight, we checked into our hotels around 5pm and decided to go out to eat before we went to the beach. I got the ring ready, and decided it was about time to make the biggest decision of my life. Dinner was amazing, I had the fried calamari and she ordered the baked salmon.  I saw the gleam in her eyes and debated whether to ask here then and there.  Something in me told me that the beach would be the perfect place, so I decided to wait. After dinner we got changed and headed to the beach, when she saw the sunset her eyes lit up and you could tell that she was amazed at what she saw.  I figured this was the best time, so I grabbed her hand and got down on one Knee.  Her hand pressed quickly over her mouth as I finally got the nerve to ask ""would you marry me"".  Tears ran down her cheek and as she shivered with excitement nodded her head and said ""Yes"".  This was the greatest day of my life and the start to many great adventures.",,3YT88D1N09KDCQ16QTRQM9C64FL3KV,0.0

He's a really close coworker of mine and we work together all the time. Me and him went to our mutual friend's birthday party and we had a good time. Later during the party, I found out that for the past 2 years we've been working together, he had a crush on me! It was really nice to hear because I also had a crush on him too. We both always thought neither one of us were interested in one another so we never bothered pursuing each other. It does suck though because he's moving to New York for college in a few weeks so any chances of a relationship is zero to none. We're both not in a place to be in a relationship anyway, much less a long distance one. What was even more surprising was that he actually tried making a move on earlier in our friendship, but I was completely oblivious to it. It was really touching to hear that coming from him though. He's someone I get along with very well and we always have something interesting to talk about with each other. Upon learning this information, we decided to keep each other in touch when he eventually moves away. Maybe something will happen in the nearby future? We both have no clue yet, but it would be really something special. We don't talk as much because we're both insanely busy in school, but we hope to see each other soon for the holidays.",,3YWRV122CTLDGJCOWOQOJDTFXJQU8J,0.0

It was going to be a bit difficult because some of the classes were on another campus in a neighboring city. It kind of worried me because my car is older and has had some trouble and I didn't want it to break down during any of the trips. Also I wasn't sure I would be able to afford the gas cost. I am a full-time student, so I don't have a full-time job. It was only twice a week, so I figured it wouldn't be too bad. I ended up meeting some folks that were taking the same classes as me that also went to the other campus. We got to talking and figured out a ride-sharing schedule that allowed us to rotate who drove each other to and from the campuses. Like one person would drive this week and then another would drive next week and the next week I would drive, etc. That way no one person had to put the mileage on their car and we all chipped in for gas. I was so thankful that I met that group, because I was really having trouble making ends meet with how much gas I was using making those trips. It doesn't seem like much, but even a few bucks can make the difference for a college student. I like carpooling because we get to talk about a lot of things on the ride. I found out that Bob and I like the same hockey team and we are going to go to a game next week. I also learned that Jan is from my same hometown, we went to different highschools but we used to hang out at some of the same places.

For an all-ages show, guests of all ages are welcome with an admission ticket. Children age 12 and under must be accompanied by an adult. Most of the concerts at the House of Blues Orlando are general admission. General admission means that there's no reserved seats in the audience; in fact, on the main concert floor, there are no seats at all. Concert-goers simply stand wherever they can. There are a few seats around the perimeter of the floor Located 4.9 miles from the Orange County Convention Center, House of Blues accommodates 15 to 2,500 guests, and our talented staff handles every detail, so you don't have to! On any given day, guest attire ranges from business suits and dresses to fashionable jeans and t-shirts. House of Blues would like to thank you for not wearing tank tops, sleeveless shirts (men only), gym wear or casual shorts, which are not permitted in the Foundation Room. Dress shorts are acceptable. Disney Springs. Disney Springs (previously known as Lake Buena Vista Shopping Village in 1975, Walt Disney World Village in 1977, Disney Village Marketplace in 1989, and Downtown Disney in 1997) is an outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment complex at the Walt Disney World Resort in Bay Lake, Florida, near OrlandoGigs usually last between 2 and 3 hours, it depends how many supports there are and how quick at setting up they are in between. Most gigs with doors of 6.30 start between 7 and 8 and finish between 10 and 11....The House of Blues is an American chain of live music concert halls and restaurants. It was founded by Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, and Dan Aykroyd, co-star of the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. A new band might only have 10 songs, while a band like U2 has dozens at least. I'd say if you have 3 or more albums, a 90-minute show should be the minimum. But I remember being disappointed the first time I saw Depeche Mode, as well as a NIN concert I saw, each of which were only 90 minutes. If you've got a 30-45 minute set then I'd say about 7-10 songs, depending on how long your songs are, and how much stage banter you do. If you arrange a gig, the venue or promoter should tell you how long your set will be, and if they don't, there's no harm in asking.",,3Z4GS9HPNWW7IUV99B57VLJ05MJ77Q,0.0

We shared memories and stories, caught up with distant cousins and aunts and uncles, and said goodbye to the ghosts we were leaving behind. It was a nice reunion because I haven't seen this much of my family at the same time. We would just visit each other but not all at the same time. There was other people that my family that I haven;t seen in a long time. There is also family members that I have not seen at all. Usually, I am a type of person that will be quiet in these reunion but I had to talk. But I saw my cousin that I was close with when I was little. I wanted to rekindle that relationship with them.  So we talked about how school has been and learned that we had different career paths. But what we did have in common is our love for basketball. We always played when we were kids and dreamed to be basketball stars. It was crazy to think that after all these years we would still have anything in common. Talking about basketball made us break the ice and we were closer that I thought. We had the same favorite food and no one I knew did.

But there is something I know.  The thing is that I was talking to two girls. One large one and one a somewhat attractive one. They were caring for me to listen to me. That is all know.

My grandfather and his brother and sisters were all there at the house where they grew up. We had a nice supper and everyone sat around and talked about times past. They told stories and shared a lot of great memories and tears too. One of my distant cousins had had plaques made for all the siblings, using old wood from the corn crib with the family name. They shared stories about their brother who had just died, and we met his illegitimate grandchildren whom we had just learned about. That was exciting, and everyone was so welcoming to them. They had inherited a portion of the estate from my great uncle on his death and had come to see the farm for the first and last time. At the sale, a young family with children made the highest bid. We were all happy to see that a new family with kids would be making new memories there. But we were all a bit broken-hearted to say goodbye to it as well. I took a lot of photographs and went to some of my favorite spots, like the creek in the woods, and the hayloft. The most memorable moment was probably sitting outside at dusk and watching the fireflies start to glow like I had so many times as a child. I loved being there with my grandfather and most of his siblings, and one of my uncles, and cousins both near and more distant.

The first girl was really attractive and I was hoping to get her phone number. So we started drinking shots and I might have drank too much. No I drank way too much, who am I kidding.

We named him Cosmo after Cosmo in the fairly odd parents cartoon for the kids.  The adults liked the name Cosco because he was kind of goofy like Cosmo Kramer on Seinfeld. He ended up becoming my wife's dog as she was home with him most of the time. He loved the kids and loved walking to school with them. He was a great watch dog, he watched over the house and watched the kids from the window when they were old enough to ride bikes to school alone. I remember one day our son fell off his bike and Cosmo ran to me in the office and barked like crazy. I had no idea why he was barking. My son walked in all scratched up and told me he fell off his bike. We had many good years with Cosmo. He loved being with his family and going to the dog park. He loved cuddling on my wife's legs. When he was only 8 years old the vet detected a heart murmur. The murmur progressed to heart failure. My wife was very depressed and so was Cosmo. We got a puppy to cheer everyone up and it worked for about 9 months. It gave Cosmo a job to do and got him out of his depression.  Sadly, he had a stroke and could no longer stand up. We had a vet come to our house to put him to sleep. It was one of the saddest days of our lives.",3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGGBBHKZ,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGGBBHKZ,0.0

My beloved dog, Jesse, passed away while I sat with him in his final moments. He was 13 years old and I never expected to lose him at that age. I always thought he would be with me for many years and that we would share many memories together. Unfortunately, our time was cut short and I had to say a very painful goodbye to him. He passed unexpectedly so I didn't have time to emotionally prepare for the loss. The day before, something told me that I needed to take a day and take him out and have a good time. We went out for a ride and went to Burger King, one of his favorite places to eat. He had a cheeseburger with bacon and he ate almost the whole thing. I brought him home that night and took him to bed like usual. When I woke up the next morning, I noticed that he was having a hard time breathing. I covered him up with a blanket. I knew that by the time I could call the vet, he wouldn't still be with me. I cried as I sat with him, petting him softly and keeping him calm by letting him know I was there with him and wouldn't leave him. I could see him leaving me as his breathing started to get slower. As much as i wanted to beg and plead for him to stay with me, I couldn't stand to see him suffer. Once I knew he passed, I sat with him for another few minutes. I couldn't bring myself to move; it was almost as if I was frozen. I couldn't believe I had to say goodbye to my loyal best friend that had been with me for so long. He was, and will always be my Jesse. As I look around my house today, it is almost like I can still feel him and hear him around me. I know he will always be with me in spirit.",3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM9B7Z1L,3Z7VU45IPZ3CRIMD3QGHLVLM9B7Z1L,0.0

But she finally reached the age of Kindergarten and whether I liked it or not she was ready to go. I mean all kids have to do that at some time. I was worried about her too because it would be the first time that she was gone all day also. Well it has went okay. She likes it and she has made a lot of friends already.  She has also learned so much. She really is enjoying herself and having a good time in life.  I am glad it is working out for her and that she is happy and I have gotten used to it also and am able to enjoy some time that I am not chasing after a silly little girl.

When my partner and I went to attend a conference I had no idea we were intended to give a speech. The conference had many doctors and researchers from around the world there. When they asked me to come up and speak I decided to go up and give it my best effort but I froze up. I didnt have slides or models. I was talking about a device that I could not show off or effectively communicate our product. I think i lost some clout with these people as I floundered and didnt know what to say. I know if i were being explained a medical procedure or device i would want someone well versed in it. Since this happened 6 months ago I have been working on impromptu speeches and confidence in public speaking. I want to be prepared if this happens again. I think it is important to communicate efficiently even when under prepared. I have some key talking points now and have been able to bring it up in casual conversation no problem. Time will tell if I am prepared the next time a big event comes up. But all in all I have learned a valuable lesson. Always be prepared for anything that may come your way.,,3Z9WI9EOZ0AS6Y855EGSQ3DGO78KHZ,0.0

He had recently started a company with the dream of running his own business in the next year or two but we were not prepared for that to start immediately!  His boss discovered his new company and fired him on the spot.  No two weeks notice, no time to prepare.  Thank God he had some vacation time saved up so we weren't completely screwed financially.  Many concerns crossed my mind.  How will we afford food?  How will we pay our mortgage?  How will we send our kids to the private school that they love and thrive at?  My husband and I both worked diligently over the next few weeks to get everything set up for the business that we thought we would have a year to accomplish.  We opened a bank account, fixed up the website, created a LinkedIn account, and started emailed companies looking for work.  He also attended a conference to try to make some connections there.  Many people were interested in his capabilities but it takes time to get a contract officially signed.  My husband created his first blog post and it quickly received a significant amount of attention from the tech community.  He has great ideas and would be a huge value to anyone willing to work with him.  We know that there is great potential in our new endeavor and we are confident in our eventual success but we need to start bringing in money soon.",3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DFOBZCM,3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DFOBZCM,0.0

Our roomates had the cops and complaints against us and if we didn't move out today we were going to get evicted. Because it's ;ast minute noone can help us move so we got a uhual and are mving everything out of our old apartment into our new one a half hour away! Couches, desks, tvs, beds all the heavy stuff ourself and it is grueling labor. We started at 9am and have only almost finished at 10pm.  There have been so many bumps in the road today that have made me so angry. Originally my roomates were working so we could do all this without them here but ofcourse they never left. I hate them for making this happen to us and it's been so awkward living with them. Then we go to the uhual place and our reservation never went through so we waited an hour to get the uhual! My sister has to work at 4 so we wanted to get alot done before then because i will have to do the rest by myself. I feel so mentally and emotionally drained from all of this. Everything hurts on my body and I just want it over with. I feel strong and accomplished that I did most of this by myself.",,3ZAK8W07I50VYU7L1KD9QYNX3UHU06,0.0

He passed away four months ago. It was one of the most horrific things I've ever had to deal with. I had been taking care of him for a year prior to his passing. I quit my job and he became my full time job along with parenting my three year old. The day that it happened was sort of unusual. My mom was coming to visit. It was the first time they had been in the same room with me since their divorce. Also, my wife and I were arguing all day. This was probably due to the stress. My mom and I went to the store to pick up a few things and my wife text me. The message said she had called for an ambulance for my dad and I needed to come home immediately. When I pulled into the driveway I saw the EMTs inside my house. This is unusual because he was always able to meet them outside. My dad was nearly unconscious as they wheeled him out on a stretcher. The EMT said I could come in the ambulance. On the way out I slapped my dad's face and he came to long enough for me to tell him I was there and for us to lock eyes. However, I knew it was the end. We had done this at least twice a month for a year. But this time felt different. On the way to the hospital he had a massive heart attack and died for all intents and purposes. They could never get him back at the hospital and I told them to stop chest compressions. It was the worst day of my life.",,3ZAZR5XV024WELWBJN512R4DPSWCZ2,0.0

I figured it was worth a shot, and decided to contact the home owners by letter. I told them about how I imagined raising a family there. I wrote about how I dreamed of having children and pushing them on the old tire swing in the front yard. I must have pulled one of their heart strings because they accepted my offer.

As the baby of the family, she is the first to actually move to a different town or city, let alone 7 hours away.  The only good thing about her moving so far is that she will be only one hour away from my mom.  It makes me feel better that if anything happens my mom will be right there until I can be.  I took it really hard, of course, and haven't been quite myself these past few months without her here.  She was not only my best friend, but she was always here to make sure I take care of myself.  She would do little things for me when I worked all day, like clean the house, have dinner ready, and put a scentsy on so the house smelled good when I got home.  We talked all the time about absolutely everything, and all of a sudden she was not here and I was extremely depressed.  My husband and I had drifted apart and hadn't even realized it.  Last week, I found out that my son is moving as well!  Both children leaving in one year!  In fact, he will be almost in the same town, and I told him when his father and I are not getting along, I am going to bring his dad to his house and drop him off!  Only jokingly, of course!   My husband and I have been talking about being alone again and although we miss our children, we have an opportunity to get to know each other again, and perhaps even fall in love all over again.

I was really fear and getting very worry about my son.  Sometimes my son did not do any thing without the help of myself.    Nowadays it was really very hard thing to manage my son activities in home.  My wife works at home.  But she also do not know about how to tackle or manage my toddle son's non stopped activity.  Three months ago my toddler son broke his arm while I was not around on him.  My also doing some work in the house.  So she did not know how to make the first aid kid.  So she suddenly make a call for me and telling about the incident. I was really getting very sad about the incident of my small child  Because I love my son very much than everything in this world  So, that I am not able to tolerate this incident.   I was totally blanked and think of my child's pain while going to the home.  My colleagues are very support and make myself calm and help me taking my child in the hospital   After the injury of my child I often took permission or leave.  But the manager of my office may understand my situation.  because he is also a father of his child. And also I spent more time for my toddle kid making himself very enthusiastic and enjoyable.Nowadays I was really very like to spent more time between my son and also my wife.  Which decision made myself very happy and energetic to do my works properly in my office and also in my house so I just giving the best advice to all married couples is being very good to your child and family which makes you very happy and made your life fulfillment.  Nowadays my life is very beautiful only because of my lovable family. Unexpected event that changed my Life Sometimes things happen in the lives of people that they have no control over. When these things happen I call them life experience, and they often leave people muttering the words Why me From time to time, actions of others affect my own. Other times, an act of irresponsibility and immaturity on people’s part could cause life changing events on our loved ones and on us. From bad events, I have learned.  If you want to be happy you should spent more time with family members. always do more things for you family makes you happy and feel proud to yourself.  Families are an integral part of one’s life it does not matter if you have a small or big family as long as you have one. A family serves as the first school to the child where one learns about various things",,3ZGVPD4G6U3D02YM590RR14H4CNTZG,0.0

Taking advantage of less heat, my unruly neighbor decided to take up her woodworking activity on her apartment balcony again. Her balcony is situated next to my room desk and across from my front door where I work on my laptop. She moved in next door while still employed by the property. She began causing a ruckus by cursing, at her incredibly hyperactive child as well as her older stepchildren, as she banged, hammered, etc for months on end. It was taken in stride under the impression that she was working on remodeling the apartment in lieu of the usual maintenance crew. She eventually stopped when the summer heat became unbearable but still let her child screech, scream and climb all over the place while she looked at her phone in the evenings. She'd yell at him every 20 seconds or so instead of paying attention to him or taking him to the park across the street. When walking past her, she would ignore anyone coming across her. The noise was intolerable as she started up again. This time, she used heavy machinery from early morning into the evening. Her kid would just screech at the top of his lungs next to her. I started recording her extraordinary noise in audio files and video . I also began taking images of her woodpile, hidden from public view, but clearly visible from my front door. I messaged the property manager about her proximity and balcony violations but got no response. I called the front desk and they said the manager wasn't in. They said they couldn't do anything because they didn't have authority. Following day, same attempts and replies but nothing... third day, trying to get management to stop her, nothing. Eventually while she worked all day again, some other neighbor confronted her and she stopped... until he left, then started again. I called the corporate office overseeing  more than just this complex. No answer. Saturday rolled around, nothing, she was still at it ALL day. After some initial prejudice and trying to back me off, I quoted city ordinance statutes to the police and they came by to stop her. She lied and said she was unaware the noise was bothersome.",,3ZPBJO59KQNKSS2VDXU5MQIQEYWDHA,0.0

Of all the rape stories happening in the news lately. The men at college seem so psychotic and aggressive. I will be so worried about her. I'm worried if something like that happens she will lie to me about it. I'm so concerned about her going away to college. She was staying with friends in California but still when she got back she still acts different... like something weird happened. But she's not willing to share it with me. I'm so concerned that she will grow up to be an evil woman because of some of her actions. Her visit to Cali really turned her into a bad girl. She seems so much different. I hope that at the end of college she can get a decent job because those student loans to burden onto a husband with his own job are too much for a man to handle. She will probably end up marrying a sugar daddy. A sugar daddy that she meets that will pay off her student loans. I can see it now. It's going to be so embarrassing.

She was a lovely woman and everyone who knew her, even people outside our family absolutely loved her. She was, however, very secretive about her health and didn't want everyone to be concerned about her dying. When she did pass, it was a big deal for our family. We had spent almost every holiday at her house, eating delicious foods at her table. She always went all out when it came to the family, and everyone always go the best she could offer. My family was really upset that I didn't go to the funeral. At the time I was only a teenager and had never attended a funeral. I was grieving but also really terrified to see her in that way. I was scared that that would be the last time I saw her. I thought about all the times that we had shared together and it was overwhelming and unbearable for me. My family just could not find the sympathy to understand how I felt and acted as though I didn't care about her passing, when that was the furthest from the truth. The only person who really understood was my father. He really got how frightening it could be for a child to have to see their grandmother's body before they put her in the ground. He told me not to worry about the rest of my family's opinion and that it would eventually blow over. I still am really thankful for him understanding how I felt.",,3ZR9AIQJUCVWHWD6MEMRDUP3VGO049,0.0

I have been to other countries, but I haven't been to other states really. Pulling out of my driveway and out onto the road was a surreal feeling. Usually I'm in work mode and don't get to enjoy life as I should. So finally looking up to getting some vacation time was pure bliss. Making it to the airport and pulling out my passport was pretty cool too. The whole setup felt like I was in some kind of movie. I was ready to go on some kind of mission where I would reach the ultimate heights of relaxation. Really, I was just happy to get away for a bit. Getting onto the plane and seeing Miami slowly fade away from view was nothing short of amazing. I must admit it was a wondrous day. I touched back down in just under four hours and the weather change was head scratching. It was hot, but with the humidity missing, you could survive if you got under some shade.  The people were totally different as well from back home. While I was used to a smattering of cultures there were really only white people around. Though I must say, I would certainly like to go back.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8,,0.0

It was a memorable occurrence to me because so many things that changed how I viewed life happened on the flight. To begin with, the two airports were completely different. The airport in my home state featured a mish-mash of people from all cultures and backgrounds. It was noisy, crowded, and full of people looking around and in some sort of rush. Compared to the airport I touched down in North Carolina, the people there were mostly of one race (white), it was sparse, and the airport was quiet. I couldn't believe how different things and people were outside of my home state. On the plane ride itself, seeing the sun rise over and above the clouds made me think that life and the world is a lot bigger than I realized. There is a whole world out there I have never visited with people I've never met or no nothing about. It teaches me that it's not good to limit yourself to one place or get comfy sitting in place your whole life. There is so much opportunity and so many things to explore out there. The land area around North Carolina is full of forests and hills and unlike my home state which is flat and all beaches. It really made me broaden my horizons ans know that there's a lot out there to reach out and grab. If I could take this trip all over again, I would because I believe it was an important part of my growth and development. When I got off the flight and hit the ground in North Carolina, it felt like a quaint place- honestly one I wouldn't mind finding myself living in with the newfound mindset the trip gave me.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDO60FS8,0.0

Meanwhile I met my close friend which last before 3 years. And my spouse gifted me a new car. And got a more and more surprises. That was an awesome day.

The doctor ordered a scan of my abdomen where I had been complaining of pain for several weeks, and some blood work done. Two weeks ago I received a phone call to come in again to go over those results. Thinking it was just something like an ulcer, or hernia, or something like that, I just assumed my doctor wanted to discuss a treatment, and to prescribe me some possible medications. When he entered the room at his office, he had a very serious look on his face, which came as no comfort to me. He then proceeded to inform me that I had a cancerous growth that was found on my liver. I was in shock, to say the least, and have spent the last couple of weeks since the diagnosis trying to wrap my head around it.  I was told it was serious, and was given three to five years on average to live. I was also told that almost no one beats liver cancer. I have yet to decide on what treatment recommendations to go with, and am preparing myself to discuss this further in the next week or so. My wife is also devastated, and so are our children. In the mean time, I've decided to keep a very positive attitude, as much as possible, with the determination that I plan to be one of the few that beat this disease. I have been trying to go on living as normal as possible since the diagnosis, in order to maximize my quality of life no matter what my future holds. I refuse to allow anyone to tell me I can't beat this, or to let any setbacks get the best of me. I have always been a fighter, and this is no different.

Whether it's with my spouse, friends or colleagues, I find myself getting emotional over minor things. A few weeks ago, one of my direct reports made an error in a project that was presented to senior management. We didn't catch the error until after the presentation.  Our conclusions would have been different had we not made the error. I spent a day explaining to the meeting attendees what had happened and how we would fix it.  I was also very angry with my analyst who didn't double check his work.  I told him that I am going to give him a bad review on the project and that will definitely affect his bonus for the year.  After the dust settled, I felt awful. First, I could have caught the mistake myself had I paid more attention to the presentation.  Second, most people were understanding as we were going to fix the error.  Third, this incident carried over in the evening to my home where I was upset and was rude to my spouse and son.  The learning from this incident is that I should learn to be calm under pressure.  I should start with being kind to myself, and then be kind to others.  Though I have known this for years, I have never been able to put this into practice.  But I am going to take a sincere effort and improve myself going forward.

I was coming home from the store after getting groceries for dinner, when a massive black bear ran in front of my car! I wasn't even in a rural area either, so it totally took me by surprise. That thing really came out of nowhere too, and ran way faster than I imagined a bear could run. This was definitely not a small bear by any means. I had to slam on my breaks at the time so thankfully there was nobody behind me. I could see another car going the same direction that also stopped. When we eventually drove off we both locked eyes and kind of expressed the same level of astonishment to each other as we parted. It was all very surreal, and something I've never experienced before in this area. The bear ended up running into a larger forest on the other side of the road, but I can't imagine we have a large population of bears here despite this incident. The environment isn't too bad but I wonder how much food they would be able to find since most of this city is suburban. My only regret about that day is not having time to get my phone out for a picture. My wife didn't really believe me when I told her the story, and only relented after seeing how serious I was about the whole thing. A picture would have been all the evidence I needed, and also a cool memento to remember the event. I know I will definitely be on the lookout for my new friend next time I'm driving in the same area!",,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDPM3SFL,0.0

Her mother and I had the talks with her. We know that she's a smart kid, and generally stays out of trouble. But this is a rough school district, and it can't be said for sure that every single person is safe. I took the day off from work so that I could drop my daughter off myself. I know that I can't do this every day and she'll eventually need to take the bus, but I wanted her to have some sense of familiarity. My daughter was fearless. As much as we warned her to stay clear of trouble, she didn't fully grasp the concept of how dangerous this school is. Truth be told, I didn't want to lay it all out on the table for her. Perhaps I lulled her into a false sense of security? But more likely this is a childlike, innocent fearlessness. She grew up in this rough neighborhood, but of course we always kept a very close eye on her, and she hasn't had to face many of the harsh realities of ""the hood"".One day I'll get her out of this neighborhood. She'll be able to ride the bus to and from school every day without being exposed to the ugliness around her. The homeless, the addicts, the criminals. My daughter deserves better, but I can't give it to her just yet. As she steps out of the car and skips into her class, all I can hope is that this school does not break her.",,3ZV9H2YQQET47QVNF7ATAK61TBE3WR,0.0

We always end up talking, monthly. But today I realized that I wasn't always right. He had done so much wrong that it blinded me to everything. I wanted him to make up for everything bad he's done, without giving the opportunity for him, as a person, to be able to make it up to me how he could. It was an impossible task and impossible standards that I kept asking of him. I couldn't see past myself, I could only see me and how wounded I was. It might mean that the damage has been done, but this different perspective has given me a lot to think about now. How often have we cycled through the same thing over and over again with no change, because I'd been insisting he needs to be different without giving him a chance to be so. I ask him to jump and want no hesitation, but he's always been the type to hesitate. I just really didn't take into account who he was, and how we could compromise or come to a solution. At this point in time I'm still processing the information, the feelings, and what it all means. I feel more confused now than I have ever been. It's funny, because you don't ever want to see yourself in a bad light especially when truly, you were hurt the most. He DID do bad things, I'm not negating that, but I also have been expecting some changes that are probably impossible. I would get overwhelmed talking to me too, the way I have been. I can only hope to learn from it if not for this relationship, than any in the future.",3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDOZWFSQ,3ZSANO2JCGT6GLU7FX1UE4SDOZWFSQ,0.0

At around 6 o'clock in the evening, I suffered a massive panic attack and fell into a state of intense emotional crisis. I've been battling with EXTREME anxiety and depression for near a decade now. This disorder developed as a result of a traumatic experience with a very high dose of psychedelic mushrooms in late 2010. In order to cope, I eventually turned to the realm of spirituality. Practices like meditation, yoga, and self-inquiry helped me to better manage the immensely dark feelings that I would encounter on a daily basis. But my relationship with spirituality changed overnight on the 1st of may this year. The panic attack centered heavily around my spiritual practices and this gave the crisis that followed an existential theme. Other themes were present as well such as identity and metaphysics, but they all fit neatly under the umbrella of spirituality and an inquisitive mind. I've since sought out medication and counseling which has allowed me to slowly regain a sense of normalcy. Giving a description of how emotionally scarring a true existential crisis can be is virtually impossible as no words can do it justice. It shook me to the core and persisted for weeks and still persists to some extent to this day. I was practically bedridden and totally paralyzed with fear and anxiety for hours at a time, day after day. As gloomy as this sounds though, I firmly believe that good can absolutely still come of it. If handled properly it can lead to a dramatically improved mode of being.",,,0.0

I knew vague details of our family history, such as Great grandpa LeBrun marrying a native american woman from the Kalapuya tribe in Oregon and settling down on the Willamette river area, but there were a lot of details that were either never shared with me or forgotten. My younger sister got  a subscription to an ancestry website and the three of us started digging and telling stories. I learned that my Great great grandfather was part of a group that voted for the area that is now Washington State to become part of Canada. I also learned that my great grandfather was a tax collector that raised horses. Among all of these stories I learned that my great grandmother lost nine of her eleven children to diphtheria. The only reason my grandmother and her twin survived is because they were kept in the snow outside and warm bricks were wrapped up and changed 24 hrs a day.  My grandfather, her father, inherited a huge sum of money from his tax collecting father. At one time he owned 500 acres of Willamette Valley bottom land, (which now grows incredible wine grapes) He was the first in his family to graduate HS but couldnʻt get a job because he was half native american so he started drinking heavily. This led him to be missing or in jail for large portions of time, leaving my mom and her mother vulnerable to threats from the local KKK. She told me about being followed home as a child, how they would threaten to burn her house down. She was so sad when she told me about how they couldnʻt even afford a proper lock on the front door. I wanted to learn more but I didnʻt want to press the sadder issues until she felt ready to share. Along with the sad times there were a few moments of levity.

Once the eating finished and we opened the dance floor, I wandered around to talk to everyone to make sure they were having a good time. I remember watching my brother and my mom dancing, and then his wife and her dad dancing, and finally the newly weds. I made sure to stay close by to my older brother, because he isn't married yet and I knew he felt lonely. I also grabbed some cake balls, because yum. When the actual dancing started — like, with everyone — I joined the people on the floor and had a blast. I'm not the best dancer, but I can follow along and can keep rhythm. I remember seeing my brother and how happy he was, and how pretty his bride looked. Even once the dancing started, though, I remember that i was a host and tried to keep an eye on people. I noticed one person in particular who looked lonely, and normally she really likes dancing. Not wanting the day to go badly for her, I left the dance floor and went to talk to her. I discovered she was sad because her own husband couldn't make it, so I said I would dance with her. That made her really happy, and she went back out on to the floor. Once I was satisfied she was okay, I found a couple other people to partner up and dance. I remember feeling so content and like I was serving an important purpose. I'm not normally very extroverted, but I felt like it was my responsibility, you know? We ended the night by having all the groomsmen grabbing my brother and hoisting him over their heads, then throwing him up in the air to crowd surf. He was a little terrified, but he also had fun, so it was an absolute win. I'm so glad everyone had a good time.",,,0.0

His cast comes off in another couple of days and he's excited to get to walk without crutches. The damn cast was a menace to society! There have been tons of times when he's swung that thing around and nearly tripped me. It's also riddled with dirty drawings scribbled in marker and jokes poking fun at him falling off a cliff. I still can't believe he took that tumble, but Derek likes to act fearless. I also think he might have been a little drunk, but I could never really be sure. The strangest part is that it was a cliff that we've climbed a hundred times before. I have no idea how he slipped in a way that propelled him off the cliff face and onto the ground below. That's why I think he may have been drinking beforehand, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibilities. When he hit the ground, we did chuckle a little bit. It didn't look like that bad of a fall and he landed on a soft part of the ground. Once he started moaning and whimpering, we knew it was pretty bad. We quickly ran down to check on him and his leg was bent up behind him in a very unnatural way. We had to call for an ambulance and they came into the park and took him out on a stretcher. That was almost two months ago and he's finally getting back to some normalcy. He hated having the cast at first but eventually it started to get him attention. Each time he told the story of how he fell, it got wilder and wilder. At one point I think he included something about a fight with a bear, but no one believed that version of the story. I'm happy that the fall didn't permanently injure him. I hope he learns to be more careful in the future.",,3ZY8KE4ISKPJZ21KN8HT1QGYU5NQVO,0.0

My job had to cut back my hours, so income has been tight and I have been running a little behind on bills. I have good credit and have never needed to take out a loan before. I figured now may be a good time to try, so I can pay down my outstanding debt before it gets out of hand. I was very nervous to apply. It took me a few days to get up the strength to do so. But then... my application was denied. At first, I felt guilty. Worthless. Like a failure. After a while, I started to feel frustrated and helpless. I don't even know why I was denied since my credit history is great and credit score is 750. I've never defaulted on a loan---in fact, I have never even taken one out before. So my only guess is my lower income resulted in the denial. How is someone supposed to get ahead in this world?",,,0.0

I had worked immensely hard for the last one year and was really hoping to get a seat in GMCH. When my seat got confirmed there, I was elated. But more than me, my parents were happy. It was nice to see their proud faces. But that's a story for another day. Today is about the person who was the happiest that day - My GRANDFATHER. On the day of counselling, he accompanied me the office of the Director of Medical Education. On seeing my name in the list of the selected candidates for GMC, he was elated beyond measures. It could be seen in his face; it was being reflected in his eyes and his voice. We went home after the counselling was over. As the entire family sat for lunch, he suddenly called me to his room. I went inside grandpa gave me a box, somewhat twice the size of a typical geometry box, and it looked very old. I opened the box - it contained the equipments I'd be needing for MBBS in the 1st year. I smiled as he gave the box to me. He then said the following words which I'll never be able to forget. He said - “Annu, I had brought this set almost 20 years back. As I was passing by one of the medical supplies shop during my trips (he's a surveyor), my eyes fell upon this box. It was expensive at that time, and more than that- unnecessary, yet, I still bought it, hoping that someday I can give it to my children or grandchildren. You've fulfilled my dream today. Maybe, God wanted me to witness this. Maybe, He has kept me alive for this day only.” That day, I'll make you proud in the truest sense.",,,0.0

She checked herself into the hospital with stomach pains and while under observation she developed a brain bleed which killed her. She was 65. When I try to remember the day it happened, when my brothers and I went to the hospital, it feels like I'm remembering a dream. I was in shock and my brain was in full blown panic mode, not only for that day but for weeks. Something that I do remember is seeing my mom hooked up to a breathing machine. I had assumed at that point that she was alive and in some kind of coma so I was talking to her, telling her things that were going on in my life. Later a group of doctors gathered us in a room and they were relaying the string of events that led to this situation. I remember, thinking my mom was in a coma, asking about the prognosis. The doctor non-chalantly told us that even though our mom was breathing mechanically she was actually dead. He didn't elaborate and moved on with the rest of the information he had to give us. I remember the way he said it made me feel like I was stupid. However I was still in shock so I didn't have the wherewithal to ask any follow-up questions. I did some googling and found out that when brain death happens it's common for hospitals to keep the body hooked up to breathing machines so they can harvest the organs later. I wish the doctor had explained that part better. Up until this point in my life I had been fortunate that I had not lost anybody close to me. I recently had friends that had both lost parents and I tried to be as consoling as I could but now that it's happened to me I've realized that there's not a lot anybody can say that will make you feel better. That death affects you profoundly. In my case it took roughly a month before I felt like my life was regaining any kind of balance and my mom and I weren't particularly close in the last few years of her life. I imagine the closer you are to the person who dies the more off balance your life becomes.",,,0.0

That's the day I officially started dating the love of my life. The day started out as normal as any but the evening I had a party to attend. I invited my now boyfriend to come to this party with me. He is involved in the sport, wrestling, that the party was for and also knew many of the other people there. We both had a ton of fun. There were several people there, good food and drinks. Immediately he went over and started chatting with my dad and quickly my dad knew that he wanted me to be with this man. We continued to bounce around and have fun but eventually we headed back to our apartment. At the time we were living together as friends. When we got back we started talking about feelings and what we wanted in the future. Everything seemed to be aligning perfectly. Finally he looked at me and said ""are you in?"" I looked back with a big grin on my face and said ""Yes, I'm in"". Ever since that day we've been nearly inseparable except when he is spending time with my dad. That night had a huge impact on me and I will forever remember it.",,,0.0

Recently my kids came to visit for 3 days and we rented a boat for one day, but what was more enjoyable was the third day we drove to the Grand Canyon.  I had only seen it as a small child, 6 years old.  My husband had grown up not far from there.  My kids had never seen it.  Since I hadn't seen my kids in years, even the time driving there was enjoyable because we could ""catch up"" as well as the fact that they had never met my husband.  Once we got there we picked the tour that we felt my husband could best handle since he is visually impaired.  My kids were very patient  at not getting too far ahead of us and such.  We had a fantastic day.  We will never forget seeing a cliff with a small plateau and this mountain goat was just standing on the plateau.  Pretty amazing how it got there.

My Uncle Eric died. Just a week prior he had been diagnosed with cancer and we were unsure of the prognosis. He wasn't even 50. He lived about 3 hours away from us and my parents were going back and forth to be with him and planned on bringing him to live with them had his prognosis turned out better. The worse part is that my moms sisters filed paperwork with the court to try to control what happens to his body. Eric was autistic and needed a guardian because he couldn't completely take care of himself and needed help with decision-making. All Eric wanted was to be buried next to his parents. He wanted nothing to do with these sisters and actively avoided having them in his life. His parents were cremated and he was aware that he already had a plot next to theirs and that he would be cremated too. The sisters took us to court trying to get control of his trust and his life insurance. I was so upset knowing this wasn't about Eric and his best interest. It was about them trying to get their hands on his money, which my mother controls. My mother didn't ask for this, she was designated by her own parents, yet her sisters have it out for her as if she had done something wrong. They have always been low-life's, hell bent on hurting others so none of this was shocking to us. We barely had any time to prepare but showed up to court with a huge binder of evidence of things they had both done, text messages from Eric, messages from granny from when she was alive, proof of crimes one of them had committed, etc. The one sister who showed up brought one sheet of paper they deemed inadmissible and then lied right to the judge's face as he asked her questions about things he was reading among our mountain of evidence. I was ecstatic that the judge ruled in our favor and that Eric will be where he belongs and where he wanted to be. It was a rough couple of weeks but I'm glad we could get justice for Eric.",,,0.0

I first became a Christian when I was eleven years old. It was honestly a traumatic experience for me because I was raised in churches that were, to be bluntly and brutally honest, cruel to my family and me. My parents were ostracized for many, many things, including the fact that my dad had an old navy tattoo and my mom homeschooled us. Were were basically the poster children for teasing and humiliation. As I grew older, my perception of God grew more and more confused. In fact, I developed a true and utter terror of God and Jesus. Churches pounded hell, fire, and brimstone, so I just turned myself over to serve God out of terror. When I became a Christian, I broke because I felt that I was still sinning or forgetting to read my Bible sometimes, or losing my temper. I felt that I needed to be rebaptized since I didn't read my Bible all the time due to forgetting, or the fact that I was going through puberty and would sometimes lash out at my family. I now know that I have PCOS and PMDD, so that explains a lot, but my old self thought I was clearly unregenerate and worthy of hell even in my saved state. I would pray the ""sinner's prayer"" every night out of fear that I wasn't living perfectly enough and, should I die, I would burn in hell. I eventually felt that I lost my faith. After losing my grandmother, my faith in God dwindled away, piece by piece, because I was angry that an all-powerful God could let this horrible thing--this death-- continue when He had the power to stop it. I was going to a very modern church, and I felt even more disconnected because the church never spoke of much of anything except ""self help."" I felt like I had to leave there, but I was afraid. So I began tearing up the Bible and deep theology, determined to understand God in ways that I never had before. I read words of wisdom from the Bible and great Biblical scholars like Swindoll, McGarthur, J.C. Ryle...I couldn't sleep at night, because, as I was digging deeper, I realized that I never truly understood the Bible until then. Never. I would sleep little, spending late, late hours of the night in study and prayer. It was life-changing because, out of this ""metamorphosis,"" I began to truly connect to God and understand our purpose on this earth. I understood the plan--why Jesus had to die, why His timing for ending the world is perfect, and why we shouldn't fear death if we put our faith in Him. It all began to make sense -- the meaning of baptism, the reason we struggle with sin...God is our advocate to walk with us through it all. We don't have to be perfect -- we strive, we pray, and we constantly crave a deeper connection to our God. It changed me, and I am walking the path to re-baptism because I truly love God and His plan for our lives.",,,0.0

It was a special event for me as I haven't seen them in about 10 years. For the exception of my mother and my younger brother all of my relatives live in Cuba. I had been planning and was very interested in going to see my family for many years, but was unable to because of lack of money mostly because for most of those years I was underage and wasn't able to raise enough money. After raising enough money for my visa and the plane ticket along with all other necessary expenses I would be having on this trip I decided it was time to finally go on this long awaited trip. I booked my flight, told my younger brother about the trip but decided not to tell anyone else as I wanted to surprise them. On the day of the flight I took an Uber to the airport as the only person that new was my underage brother and therefore I had no one that could of drove me there. In the airport things were pretty simple I just checked in and since I just have a small luggage I didn't have to make any long lines in order to check in additional bags. The flight went smoothly as well and about an hour I was in the capital of Cuba. Once I got there I immediately went to the arrival line where a lady asked me some questions and after a short interview I was able to get my bag and check out. Once I walk out the airport doors It honestly felt like I was transported 50 years back. All the cars and structures seemed like they were all from the 70's or older for the exception of tourist rental cars and the occasional modern Kia like small car. Thankfully I was fluent in the language and remembered by previews trips to Cuba as a kid and was able to find a person that guided me to a place in the city where I could rent a car for my week long stay. I drove directly to where my family lived about 3 hours away from the capital with no directions as I remembered how to get there. Seen my family once again was an awesome experience and brought back many memories from my childhood trips. The week went by faster that expected but I was able to see my siblings in the island as well as the rest of my family from both my moms and dads side, as well as experienced a whole other culture. Undeniably, it was a very emotional trip and one I would love to experience again in the near future but next time I'll be taking my younger sibling so he can also experience it.",,,0.0

We were in our evening service, when during it, someone busted through our back doors and into the congregation. It was two gentlemen who had robbed us a year prior. At first we were all uptight, and ready to move, as we could not believe they were back to ruin us again. Well, they didn't. The were dressed nicely, and solemnly walked down the aisle to the front, asked everyone to rise, and apologized to us, and said they had found God. He wanted to go from pew to pew to sahek everyone in the church's hand. A very nice gesture. Along with it, they said sorry to all of us. It was truly touching, and we actually had them baptized later on that night. They have now joined our congregation and we are happy for that. It is not everyday that someone just does a 360 like that. We opened our arms to them after that night, and I think that helped. They are trusting and hard working, and want to truly get better. We as a family, are ready to help them down that tough path. It will be a journey. The true power of God and change has shined through!!!!",,,0.0

We both go to college and live in the same dorm building. She always had this pattern of making up excuses for not seeing me, or communicating with me. It has gone on since the begining of last year, we would try to do something of a routine together but she would always fail to commit. Last year it was running, then the next semester was going to gym, then this fall we decided we would try going to yoga. She had gone the first night with me, but she evaded it 3 times in a row after that. I told her over the summer that she would have to actually make an effort to reach out to me and be my friend. She claims I would never text her but I made my attempts and she did not reciprocate like a friend would. She would also get back together with her abusive ex multiple times, like my advice did not matter. She would also hang out with people she claimed to hate. She did this out of lonliness. She made me feel used, where before she would invite me to her room all last year to complain about her ex, which I would listen to, when they are both okay after the 4th time getting back together, I was cast to the side. So when she kept avoiding me, I gave it to her straight over text that I miss her friendship and that I did not need this support in my life right now, and that we were growing apart, she lashed out at me. She claimed I was too sensitive and how I was the problem and that we would still be friends if I wasn't so sensitive. She said it in a much ruder tone though. I avoid her now, and I still feel the hurt from all of that. I only wish it could have ended more amicably because thats how I approached her. I approached it like how my counselor told me to, and she said I have to realize that it may not go the way it is intended to, and she was right, and that is why it hurt all the more.",,,0.0

The kids all climbed up on the ladder and we got a picture of them.  There was also a playground at the apple orchard.  It was a playground made mostly with farm equipment.  There was a fort built around an old tractor.  There were also a bunch of big tractor tires in a sand pit.  The kids really enjoyed that.  The store had apple cider donuts.  Those were delicious.

One of the special location straight out of one of the horror movies, where they was a clinic next to graveyard where zombies popped up. In the clinic there was a psychopathy patient, doctor and staff going on with surgery. Of all the fan that visited to the location, the most memorable was this one experience with the group of three people than came in. All action were being recorded in cameras. The three fans came in through the entrance with fear, and coldness on their faces. They went to the surgical clinic room first where they witnessed the surgeon doing a surgery an accidentally cutting the eye then the patient would wake and kill all the staff and head towards the fans. Two of the fans went straight back trying to open the door back which obviously was closed, so they headed towards the next area frantically leaving their friend behind. As for the friend, he was basically glued to the ground no matter how much the actor tried to make him to move, shocked to the point of fainting while standing, while peeing himself. Even after everything was over the person still did not move until about 30 minutes. In the end the friends has to come back in to get him to go back outside to continue the event.",,,0.0

This actually just happened 2 days ago. I am a senior in college majoring in nursing, and have worked hard the past 3 years to do well in my classes and get good grades. As a result, I have a high GPA (3.9) and so I was eligible to join the Honor Society. It started with an email sent to me inviting me to join. Once I decided to join, I signed up online and paid the fee. What was extra special was that my parents offered to pay the fee for me because they knew it was important for me to join and they wanted me to be recognized for all my hard work. Then, this past Monday was the induction ceremony. I was a little disappointed because my parents were unable to attend, but two of my friends came instead. I dressed up in a nice dress, picked up my friends, and we went to the ceremony. There was a speaker who presented her research project, and then it was time for the induction. One of my professors read off all of our names (only 7 people in my class were invited to join), and we all went up individually to sign our names in the booklet, receive a certificate, and receive purple cords that we will wear at graduation. Afterwards we took pictures and ate cake. It was a really special night and it was nice to be recognized for my hard work. I appreciated my friends coming to support me. I am proud of myself for this accomplishment and for almost making it through nursing school.",,,0.0

In most cultures, birthdays are celebrated in some of the same ways. Often, birthdays are celebrated with a gift, party, or some other special act. main event this Falling in love with the person that is your perfect fit is one of the best feelings in the world. Although it's not uncommon to find yourself falling in love (or simply, lust) with the wrong person before getting to Mr. Right, when you finally meet the guy for you, you'll realize it was worth the wait. Everything you thought you knew about love and relationships will suddenly be turned on its head. And it's not just love you'll feel - you'll go through a whole host of other positive emotions. Here are some of the things you can expect to feel when you start falling for the right someone. When I met my husband, the primary emotion I remember feeling was shock. It sounds nuts, but I truly couldn't believe he even existed. I had spent so much time before not even sure if I wanted to be in a relationship. I didn't really believe that true love was real, and I definitely didn't think I'd ever feel so strongly about someone that I wanted to be with forever. Falling in love with the right person will leave you feeling surprised, like you didn't see it coming. You'll marvel at the fact that someone so perfect for you even exists - let alone loves as much as they do, too. In prior relationships, I would purposely not express how I was feeling most of the time, for fear of being judged or ridiculed. It could be the biggest thing, like disappointment over a friend moving, to the smallest, like moodiness from PMS. It didn't matter - if it was a real feeling, I kept it to myself. With my husband, however, I want to do the exact opposite: share everything with him. When you're with the right someone, you'll know because you'll feel safer than you ever have in the past. In relationships before my husband, I knew what it was like to feel momentarily excited (or even happy) for a little bit.",,,0.0
